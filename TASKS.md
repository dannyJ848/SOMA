# Task Tracker - Autonomous Development

**Project:** Biological Self  
**Mode:** Autonomous Buildout  
**Vision:** Ultimate patient education tool - teaching patients what every medical specialty learns  
**Check-in Schedule:** Daily heartbeat + user check-in as needed

---

## Core Vision
Transform medical education from physician training into accessible, modular patient education:
- **Foundation** → What med students learn (anatomy, physiology, biochemistry)
- **Clinical Application** → How doctors think (differential diagnosis, lab interpretation)
- **Specialties** → Deep dives (cardiology, endocrinology, neurology, etc.)
- **Subspecialties** → Expert-level content
- **Personalized** → Always tied to their actual health data

### 2026-02-07 - AUDIT #4: Cross-Section Mode Review
- **Status:** ⚠️ ISSUES IDENTIFIED - See `audit-cross-section-report.md`
- **Critical Bug:** Head and Joint geometries do NOT apply clipping planes
  - Affected: Head (1), All joints (12) = ~40% of body regions
  - Impact: Cross-section mode appears broken for these regions
- **Missing:** Cylinder geometry handler (neck region doesn't render)
- **Working:** UI controls, sliders, visualizer, mode selection
- **Performance:** Acceptable but could optimize re-renders
- **Fix Estimate:** 4-6 hours
- **Recommendation:** Fix before Beta release

---

### 2026-02-07 - CRITICAL FIXES: Anatomical Corrections & Education Wiring
- **✅ Priority 1 Fixes Complete:**
  - Fixed Latin name for neck: "Cervix" → "Collum" (Cervix refers to uterine cervix, not neck)
  - Fixed arm medical conditions: Removed DVT, Carpal tunnel, Tennis elbow; added Biceps tendonitis, Humerus fracture, Triceps strain
  - Added missing spine regions: Thoracic Spine (T1-T12) and Lumbar Spine (L1-L5) with anatomically correct positioning
- **✅ Priority 2 Fixes Complete:**
  - Added educational wiring: `relatedModules: string[]` field to BodyRegion interface
  - Added `educationalContentId?: string` field for future content linking
  - Wired up "Learn About This Region" button to use region's relatedModules
  - Updated shoulder Latin names: "Articulatio humeri" → "Articulatio glenohumeralis" (more standard)
  - Synced anatomyContextBuilder.ts with new spine regions and corrected arm conditions
- **Files modified:** CompleteAnatomyLaunchpad.tsx, anatomyContextBuilder.ts
- **Build status:** ✅ Successful compilation

## Blockers
None

## Next Actions (Autonomous)
1. Continue adding more educational modules (Neurology, Gastroenterology, etc.)
2. Build AI integration to recommend modules based on user conditions
3. Add personalized content using user's actual lab values

---

## Questions for User
1. Which specialty modules should I prioritize next? (Neurology? Gastro? Pulmonology?)
2. Should I build more lab modules (lipids, thyroid, metabolic panel) before other specialties?
3. Want me to start on the AI integration to suggest relevant modules?
