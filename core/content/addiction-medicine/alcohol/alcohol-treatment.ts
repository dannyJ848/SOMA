## Overview

Behavioral treatments (also called psychosocial interventions) are therapies that help people change their drinking behavior through counseling, skills training, and support. They are the foundation of AUD treatment and can be very effective.

## Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

### What is CBT?

CBT is a structured therapy that focuses on identifying and changing the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that contribute to alcohol use.

### Key Components

**Functional Analysis:**
- Identify triggers for drinking
- Understand what leads to drinking
- Examine consequences of drinking
- Recognize patterns

\`\`\`
Trigger → Thoughts → Feelings → Drinking → Consequences
   ↓          ↓         ↓          ↓           ↓
Identify   Challenge  Understand   Change    Evaluate
\`\`\`

**Coping Skills Training:**

- Spiritual but not religious (can be interpreted broadly)

## Contingency Management

### What is Contingency Management?

An approach that provides tangible rewards to reinforce abstinence from alcohol.

### How It Works

**Basic principle:**
\`\`\'
Abstinence verified by testing → Receive reward → Behavior reinforced
\`\`\'

**Implementation:**
- Drug testing (breathalyzer, urine EtG)
- Rewards for negative tests

**R**esponsibility: Emphasize patient's responsibility
**A**dvice: Give clear advice
**M**enu of options: Offer choices
**E**mpathy: Show understanding
**S**elf-efficacy: Express belief in ability to change

### Evidence

- Effective for risky drinking
- Good for mild problems
- Can be delivered in primary care
- Low cost, high impact

## Choosing the Right Approach

### Factors to Consider

| Factor | Implications |
|--------|--------------|
| Severity of AUD | More severe = more intensive treatment |
| Motivation | MET for ambivalent, CBT for ready |
| Support system | Couples therapy if partner available |
| Co-occurring disorders | Integrated treatment needed |
| Previous treatment | Different approach if prior failure |
