## What is Cannabis Use Disorder?

Cannabis Use Disorder is a medical condition characterized by problematic cannabis use causing significant impairment or distress. It involves a pattern of use that is difficult to control and continues despite harmful consequences.

## What is Cannabis?

Cannabis (marijuana, weed, pot) comes from the Cannabis sativa plant. It contains hundreds of chemical compounds, including:

**THC (tetrahydrocannabinol)**
- Primary psychoactive compound
- Causes the "high"
- Responsible for most addictive effects

**CBD (cannabidiol)**
- Non-intoxicating
- May have therapeutic effects
- Does not cause euphoria

## Forms of Cannabis

**Traditional forms:**
- Dried flower/bud (smoked)
- Hashish (concentrated resin)
- Kief (powdered trichomes)

**Modern concentrates:**
- Wax/shatter (highly concentrated)
- Oil/vape cartridges
- Edibles (food products)
- Tinctures (liquid extracts)
- Topicals (creams, lotions)

## Why Can Cannabis Be Addictive?

Cannabis affects the brain's reward system:
- Activates brain receptors (endocannabinoid system)
- Releases dopamine (causes pleasure)
- Creates tolerance over time
- Causes withdrawal when stopped

## Signs of Cannabis Use Disorder

**Physical signs:**
- Red eyes ("bloodshot")
- Increased appetite ("the munchies")
- Dry mouth
- Increased heart rate
- Impaired coordination

**Behavioral signs:**
- Using more or longer than intended
- Unsuccessful attempts to cut down
- Spending a lot of time using or recovering
- Giving up activities to use
- Continued use despite problems
- Using in hazardous situations

**Psychological signs:**
- Memory problems
- Difficulty concentrating
- Impaired judgment
- Anxiety or paranoia
- Motivation issues

## Cannabis Withdrawal

Withdrawal can occur after regular, heavy use:

**Common symptoms:**
- Irritability and anxiety
- Sleep difficulties (insomnia, strange dreams)
- Decreased appetite
- Restlessness
- Mood swings
- Physical discomfort

**Symptoms typically peak within the first week and last 1-2 weeks**

## Common Myths vs. Facts

| Myth | Fact |
|------|------|
| "Marijuana isn't addictive" | ~9% of users develop addiction; 17% who start as teens |
| "You can't withdrawal from weed" | Withdrawal syndrome is well-documented |
| "It's harmless" | Can cause mental health issues, impaired driving, respiratory issues |
| "It's not as bad as other drugs" | Less dangerous than some, but not risk-free |

## Who is at Risk?

**Higher risk of CUD:**
- Daily users
- People who started young (before age 18)
- Those with family history of addiction
- People with co-occurring mental health disorders
- Users of high-potency products

## Good News

**Treatment is effective:**
- Behavioral therapies work well
- Support groups available
- Motivational enhancement helps
- People recover every day

**Benefits of quitting:**
- Improved memory and concentration
- Better respiratory health (if smoking)
- Improved motivation
- Better mental health
- Save money`,

      title: 'How Cannabis Affects the Brain and Body',
      content: `# How Cannabis Works

## The Endocannabinoid System

### Your Body's Natural Cannabis System

The human body has an endocannabinoid system (ECS):
- **Receptors**: CB1 (brain), CB2 (immune system)
- **Endocannabinoids**: Anandamide, 2-AG
- **Enzymes**: Break down endocannabinoids

**Normal functions of ECS:**
- Regulation of mood
- Pain perception
- Appetite control
- Memory formation
- Sleep regulation
- Immune function

### How THC Affects the ECS

\`\`\`
THC enters bloodstream → Crosses blood-brain barrier → Binds to CB1 receptors
    ↓
Activates endocannabinoid system (too much)
    ↓
Alters normal brain functions:
    - Dopamine release (pleasure, reward)
    - Memory impairment (hippocampus)
    - Impaired coordination (cerebellum)
    - Altered time perception
    - Relaxed inhibition (prefrontal cortex)
\`\`\`

## Effects on the Brain

### Immediate Effects

**Desired effects:**
- Euphoria (feeling "high")
- Relaxation
- Increased sociability
- Enhanced sensory perception
- Altered time perception
- Increased appetite ("the munchies")

**Undesired effects:**
- Anxiety and paranoia (especially with high doses)
- Impaired memory
- Difficulty concentrating
- Impaired judgment
- Coordination problems
- Dry mouth, red eyes

### Long-Term Brain Changes

**With regular, heavy use:**

\`\`\`
CB1 receptor downregulation:
    ↓
Brain reduces CB1 receptors (tolerance)
    ↓
Need more cannabis for same effect
    ↓
Changes persist for weeks after stopping
\`\`\`

**In adolescents (brain still developing):**
- Potential permanent changes
- Impaired cognitive development
- Lower IQ (with heavy, persistent use)
- Increased risk of mental health disorders
- poorer educational outcomes

## Effects on the Body

### Respiratory System (Smoking)

**Similar to tobacco smoke:**
- Chronic bronchitis symptoms
- Chronic cough
- Increased phlegm
- Wheezing
- Reduced lung function

**Differences from tobacco:**
- Less lung cancer risk (studies mixed)
- Different carcinogens
- Different smoking patterns (less frequent)

**Vaping:**
- Newer technology
- Long-term effects unknown
- Concerns about lung injury (EVALI)

### Cardiovascular System

**Immediate effects:**
- Increased heart rate (20-50% increase)
- Increased blood pressure
- Vasodilation (red eyes)
- Increased cardiac workload

**Risks:**
- Increased risk of heart attack (after use)
- Arrhythmias (in susceptible individuals)
- Stroke risk (with heavy use)

### Reproductive System

**Men:**
- Reduced sperm count
- Altered sperm motility
- Lower testosterone (with heavy use)
- Gynecomastia (rare)

**Women:**
- Disrupted menstrual cycles
- Reduced fertility (potential)
- Hormonal changes

### Immune System

**Effects:**
- May suppress immune function
- Increased infection risk (controversial)
- Anti-inflammatory properties (potential benefit)

## Mental Health Effects

### Anxiety and Depression

**Complex relationship:**
- Acute use: Can cause or worsen anxiety
- Some use for anxiety relief
- Regular use: Associated with increased depression
- Causality unclear (chicken or egg?)

### Psychosis

**Cannabis and Psychotic Disorders:**
- Can trigger psychotic episodes
- Worse outcome in schizophrenia
- Earlier onset of psychosis
- Stronger strains = higher risk

**Risk factors:**
- Family history of psychosis
- Heavy, regular use
- High-potency products
- Young age of first use

### Motivation

**Amotivational syndrome:**
- Controversial concept
- Appear unmotivated
- Lack of goal-directed behavior
- May be related to intoxication rather than permanent change

## THC vs. CBD

| Compound | Psychoactive? | Effects |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| THC | Yes | Euphoria, relaxation, impaired memory |
| CBD | No | Anti-anxiety, anti-seizure, anti-inflammatory |

**The entourage effect:**
- THC and CBD work together
- CBD may moderate THC effects
- Full-spectrum products vs. isolates

## Potency and Products

### Changing Potency

**Historical trends:**
\`\`\`
1970s: ~1-3% THC
1990s: ~4% THC
2000s: ~8-10% THC
2020s: 15-25% THC (flower)
Concentrates: 60-90% THC
\`\`\`

**Implications:**
- Higher addiction risk
- More severe withdrawal
- Greater mental health risk
- More impaired driving

### Consumption Methods and Effects

| Method | Onset | Duration | Intensity | Risks |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Smoking (flower) | Minutes | 2-4 hours | Medium | Lung damage |
| Vaping | Minutes | 2-3 hours | Variable | Unknown long-term |
| Edibles | 30-120 min | 4-8 hours | High, unpredictable | Overdose risk |
| Tinctures | 15-45 min | 4-6 hours | Variable | Lower lung risk |
| Topicals | Minimal | Local | None | Minimal |

**Edibles特别注意:**
- Delayed onset leads to overconsumption
- First-pass liver metabolism (more potent THC metabolite)
- "Greening out" (panic, anxiety, nausea)
- More psychiatric effects

## Cannabis and Driving

**Impairment:**
- Impaired coordination
- Slowed reaction time
- Impaired judgment
- Lane weaving

**Risks:**
- Increased crash risk
- Especially combined with alcohol
- No standard impairment test (like BAC)
- Detection in body ≠ impairment (can detect days/weeks later)`,
