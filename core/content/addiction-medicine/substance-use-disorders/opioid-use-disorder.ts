## What is Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)?

Opioid Use Disorder is a medical condition characterized by problematic opioid use causing significant impairment or distress. It involves a pattern of opioid use that is difficult to control and continues despite harmful consequences.

## What are Opioids?

Opioids are a class of drugs that act on opioid receptors in the brain to produce pain-relieving and euphoric effects.

### Types of Opioids

**Prescription Opioids:**
- Oxycodone (OxyContin, Percocet)
- Hydrocodone (Vicodin)
- Morphine
- Codeine
- Fentanyl (prescription formulations)
- Hydromorphone (Dilaudid)
- Methadone (pain treatment)
- Tramadol

**Illegal Opioids:**
- Heroin (diacetylmorphine)
- Illicitly manufactured fentanyl
- Carfentanil

**Over-the-Counter:**
- Loperamide (Imodium) - at high doses

## Why are Opioids So Addictive?

Opioids are extremely addictive because they:
- Activate the brain's reward system powerfully
- Create intense euphoria ("rush")
- Provide strong pain relief
- Produce physical dependence quickly
- Cause severe withdrawal when stopped

## Signs of OUD

**Physical signs:**
- Constricted pupils ("pinpoint pupils")
- Drowsiness or sedation
- Slowed breathing (respiratory depression)
- Nausea and vomiting
- Itching (pruritus)
- Constipation

**Behavioral signs:**
- Obtaining prescriptions from multiple doctors
- Spending excessive time obtaining/using opioids
- Failed attempts to cut down
- Continued use despite problems
- Withdrawal from normal activities

**Withdrawal symptoms:**
- Muscle aches and pains
- Runny nose and tearing
- Sweating
- Goosebumps ("cold turkey")
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Anxiety and irritability

## The Opioid Crisis

**Key facts:**
- Over 100,000 drug overdose deaths annually in the US
- 75% involve opioids
- Leading cause of accidental death
- Declining life expectancy partly due to opioids

**Three waves of the crisis:**
1. 1990s: Increased prescription opioid prescribing
2. 2010: Shift to heroin
3. 2013: Rise of synthetic opioids (fentanyl)

## Good News

**Effective treatments exist:**
- Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)
- Methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone
- Behavioral therapies
- Recovery support services

**Treatment works:**
- MAT reduces mortality by 50% or more
- People can and do recover
- Recovery is possible at any stage

      content: `# How Opioids Work and Their Effects

## The Endogenous Opioid System

### Natural Opioid System

Our bodies have natural opioid systems:
- **Endorphins**: Natural pain relievers
- **Enkephalins**: Pain modulation
- **Endomorphins**: Pain and stress response
- **Dynorphins**: Pain and reward processing

These natural opioids are released during:
- Exercise ("runner's high")
- Pain and injury
- Stress and excitement
- Social bonding
- Eating and drinking

### How Opioids Act

\`\`\`
Opioid drug → Binds to opioid receptors → Activates reward system
     ↓
Mu receptors (primary effect)
     ↓
Dopamine release → Euphoria
     ↓
Pain relief
     ↓
Respiratory depression (danger)
     ↓
Physical dependence
\`\`\`

## Opioid Receptors

**Mu receptors (MOR)**
- Primary site for euphoria and respiratory depression
- Most opioids target these receptors
- Responsible for most addictive effects

**Kappa receptors (KOR)**
- Pain relief
- Dysphoria (unpleasant feelings)
- Some opioid effects

**Delta receptors (DOR)**
- Pain relief
- Some euphoria
- Respiratory effects

## Effects on the Body

### Short-Term Effects

**Desired effects:**
- Euphoria ("rush")
- Pain relief (analgesia)
- Relaxation and sedation
- Reduced anxiety

**Undesired effects:**
- Drowsiness and confusion
- Slowed breathing (respiratory depression)
- Constipation
- Nausea and vomiting
- Itching and flushing
- Urinary retention
- Constricted pupils

### Long-Term Effects

**Brain changes:**
- Tolerance (need more for same effect)
- Dependence (withdrawal without use)
- Reward system dysfunction
- Impaired decision-making
- Reduced pleasure from natural rewards

**Physical health:**
- Chronic constipation
- Hormonal imbalances
- Immune system suppression
- Sexual dysfunction
- Increased pain sensitivity (hyperalgesia)

**Risks:**
- Overdose and death
- Infectious diseases (if injecting)
- Vein damage (if injecting)
- Social and occupational problems
- Financial difficulties
- Legal issues

## Opioid Overdose

### Respiratory Depression - The Primary Danger

\`\`\`
Normal breathing: 12-20 breaths/minute
Opioid overdose: Can drop to < 8 breaths/minute
     ↓
Inadequate oxygen
     ↓
Hypoxia (low oxygen to tissues)
     ↓
Brain damage
     ↓
Death
\`\`\`

### Overdose Risk Factors

**Individual factors:**
- Using alone
- Previous overdose
- Lowered tolerance (after incarceration or treatment)
- Co-occurring medical conditions
- Mental health conditions

**Situational factors:**
- Using high doses
- Mixing with other drugs (benzodiazepines especially)
- Using unfamiliar sources
- Using after a period of not using

### Signs of Overdose

**The Opioid Overdose Triad:**
1. **Unconsciousness/unresponsiveness**
2. **Pinpoint pupils**
3. **Respiratory depression** (slow or absent breathing)

**Other signs:**
- Blue or purple lips/fingernails (cyanosis)
- Gurgling or snoring sounds
- Limp body
- Pale, clammy skin
- Slow or absent pulse

**This is a medical emergency - call 911 immediately**

## Contaminated Drug Supply

### Illicit Fentanyl

**The new danger:**
- 50-100 times more potent than heroin
- Often mixed into other drugs without knowledge
- Tiny amounts can be fatal
- Driving overdose surge

**Fentanyl analogs:**
- Carfentanil (large animal tranquilizer, 10,000x morphine potency)
- Acetyl fentanyl
- Furanyl fentanyl
- Many others

**In cross-contamination:**
- Cocaine
- Methamphetamine
- Counterfeit pills
- "Street" benzodiazepines
- Any illicit drug could contain fentanyl

## Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia

**Paradoxical effect:**
- Opioids can increase pain sensitivity
- More opioids needed
- Creates vicious cycle
- Common with long-term use

**Treatment:**
- Taper opioids
- Switch to different opioid
- Add non-opioid pain treatments
- Consider opioid rotation`,

      title: 'Evidence-Based Treatment for OUD',
      content: `# Evidence-Based Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder

## Treatment Overview

Effective OUD treatment includes:
1. **Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)** - Gold standard
2. **Behavioral therapies** - Essential component
3. **Recovery support services** - Improves outcomes
4. **Treatment of co-occurring disorders** - When present

## Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)

### Why MAT is Essential

**The evidence:**
- Reduces mortality by 50% or more
- Increases treatment retention
- Reduces illicit opioid use
- Improves social functioning
- Reduces criminal activity
- Reduces infectious disease transmission
- Improves birth outcomes for pregnant women

**MAT is not "trading one addiction for another"** - It's treating addiction as a medical condition.

### Three FDA-Approved Medications

**1. Methadone**

\`\`\`
Type: Full opioid agonist
Formulation: Oral liquid (dispensed daily)
Setting: Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) - specialized clinics
Half-life: Long (8-59 hours, average ~24)
\`\`\`

**Mechanism:**
- Activates opioid receptors fully
- Prevents withdrawal symptoms
- Reduces cravings
- Blocks euphoria from other opioids (at stable dose)
- Does not cause euphoria at stable doses

**Dosing:**
- Starting dose: 10-30mg daily
- Titration: Increase by 5-10mg every few days
- Typical maintenance: 60-120mg daily
- Take-home doses: Based on stability

**Benefits:**
- Most proven track record (50+ years)
- Highly effective at reducing illicit use
- Daily structure and monitoring
- Take-home doses possible for stable patients

**Side effects:**
- Constipation
- Sweating
- Weight gain
- Sexual dysfunction
- QT prolongation (heart rhythm)
- Drug interactions

**Risks:**
- Respiratory depression (especially when starting)
- Diversion potential
- Requires daily visits initially
- Stigma associated with OTPs

**Special populations:**
- Pregnancy: Treatment of choice
- Hepatitis: Can be used (dose adjustment)
- HIV: Compatible

**2. Buprenorphine**

\`\`\`
Type: Partial opioid agonist
Formulations:
  - Sublingual tablets/films (Suboxone, Subutex, Zubsolv)
  - Monthly injection (Sublocade)
  - Six-month implant (Probuphine)
  - Extended-release (Brixadi)
Half-life: 24-42 hours
Setting: Office-based (with waiver), OTPs
\`\`\`

**Mechanism:**
- Partially activates opioid receptors
- Ceiling effect for respiratory depression (safer than methadone)
- Prevents withdrawal and reduces cravings
- Blocks effects of other opioids
- No euphoria at therapeutic doses

**Dosing:**
- **Induction:**
  - Must be in mild to moderate withdrawal (COWS ≥ 8)
  - Starting dose: 2-8mg
  - May give additional 2-4mg after 1-2 hours
  - Target induction dose: 8-16mg day 1
- **Stabilization:** 16-24mg daily (most common)
- **Maintenance:** 8-24mg daily (individualized)

**Formulations:**

| Formulation | Dosing | Frequency |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Sublingual film/tablets | 2-8mg per dose | Daily or divided |
| Sublocade (monthly injection) | 300mg (first month), then 100-300mg | Monthly |
| Brixadi (weekly/monthly) | 24-32mg weekly equivalent | Weekly or monthly |
| Probuphine implant | 80mg total (4 implants) | 6 months |

**Benefits:**
- Office-based treatment (more accessible)
- Ceiling effect on respiratory depression
- Take-home from day 1 (after induction)
- Good safety profile
- Less stigma than methadone

**Side effects:**
- Headache
- Nausea
- Constipation
- Insomnia
- Sweating

**Induction considerations:**
- MUST be in withdrawal before starting
- Starting too soon causes precipitated withdrawal
- Precipitated withdrawal: Severe, sudden withdrawal

**3. Naltrexone**

\`\`\`
Type: Opioid antagonist
Formulations:
  - Oral: 50mg daily
  - Monthly injection: Vivitrol 380mg
Half-life: Oral (4h), Injection (5-10 days)
Setting: Any medical setting
\`\`\`

**Mechanism:**
- Blocks opioid receptors
- Prevents euphoria from opioids
- No opioid effects
- No physical dependence potential

**Requirements:**
- Must be opioid-free for 7-10 days before starting
- Completing withdrawal first
- If started too soon: precipitated severe withdrawal

**Dosing:**
- **Oral:** 50mg daily (poor adherence)
- **Vivitrol:**
  - Opioid-free for 7-10 days
  - First dose: 380mg IM gluteal
  - Repeat monthly

**Benefits:**
- No opioid agonist effects
- No physical dependence
- No misuse potential
- Discreet (monthly injection)
- Can be prescribed by any provider

**Challenges:**
- Must complete withdrawal first (difficult)
- Poor adherence to oral form
- If relapse: Loss of tolerance = high overdose risk
- Cannot get pain relief if needed
- Patient must be very motivated

**Best candidate:**
- Highly motivated
- Recently completed detoxification
- Good social support
- Wants to avoid opioid medications

### Choosing Between Medications

| Factor | Methadone | Buprenorphine | Naltrexone |
|--------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Setting | OTP only | Office-based | Any setting |
| Daily visit | Yes (initially) | No | No |
| Take-home | Possible (stability) | Yes (after induction) | No (monthly) |
| Pregnancy | Preferred | Alternative | Not recommended |
| Hepatitis | Use caution | Use caution | Safer |
| Diversion risk | Yes | Low | None |
| Overdose risk | Higher | Lower | Lower (with loss of tolerance) |
| Access | Limited | Good | Good |
| Initiation | Any time | In withdrawal | After 7-10 days abstinence |

### Combination Treatment

**Buprenorphine + Naloxone (Suboxone)**
- Most common formulation
- Naloxone prevents injection misuse
- Poorly absorbed sublingually
- Causes withdrawal if injected

### Duration of Treatment

**How long should MAT continue?**

\`\`\`
Minimum:   3-6 months (for short-term use disorders)
Recommended: 12+ months (minimum for most)
Long-term: Indefinitely (for severe, chronic OUD)
\`\`\`

**Evidence supports:**
- Longer treatment = better outcomes
- Many patients need years of treatment
- Some benefit from lifelong treatment
- Premature tapering leads to high relapse rates

**Tapering considerations:**
- Only after stable recovery (12+ months)
- Slow taper (months)
- Monitor for withdrawal and cravings
- Restart if relapse occurs
- Never taper due to external pressure only

## Behavioral Therapies

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

**Core components:**
- Understand triggers and high-risk situations
- Develop coping strategies
- Identify and change thought patterns
- Relapse prevention skills
- Problem-solving

**Evidence:**
- Reduces opioid use
- Improves treatment retention
- Best when combined with MAT

### Contingency Management

**Approach:** Provide tangible rewards for verified abstinence

**Types:**
- Voucher-based (earn money for drug-free urine tests)
- Prize-based (chance to win prizes for abstinence)

**Evidence:**
- Strongest evidence for reducing opioid use
- Particularly effective in initial phases
- Enhances retention

### Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)

**Approach:** Client-centered counseling to strengthen motivation

**Principles:**
- Express empathy
- Develop discrepancy
- Avoid argumentation
- Roll with resistance
- Support self-efficacy

### 12-Step Facilitation

**Approach:** Engage patients in 12-step fellowships (NA, CA)

**Benefits:**
- Free, widely available
- Peer support
- Recovery community
- Structured recovery approach

### Family Therapy

**Approach:** Involve family in treatment

**Benefits:**
- Improves family functioning
- Increases support
- Improves treatment retention

## Treatment Settings

### Level of Care Options

**Naloxone (Narcan)**
- Opioid antagonist - reverses overdose
- Multiple formulations:
  - Intramuscular injection
  - Intranasal spray
  - Auto-injector
- Effects last 30-90 minutes (shorter than many opioids)

**All patients should have:**
- Naloxone prescription
- Training on use
- Instructions for calling 911

### Harm Reduction

**For active users:**
- Never use alone

- Have naloxone available
- Don't mix drugs (especially benzos)
- Test for fentanyl (fentanyl test strips)

**For patients in treatment:**
- Educate about loss of tolerance
- Provide naloxone
- Warn against mixing medications
- Involve family in overdose planning

## Treatment Outcomes

### What Success Looks Like

**Measures of recovery:**
- Reduced or eliminated illicit opioid use
- Improved physical health
- Improved mental health
- Improved relationships
- Employment/school engagement
- Reduced criminal activity
- Improved quality of life

### Recovery Statistics

**With MAT:**
- 50% reduction in mortality
- 70-90% reduction in illicit opioid use

## Special Populations

### Pregnant Women with OUD

**Risks of untreated OUD in pregnancy:**
- Miscarriage and stillbirth
- Preterm labor
- Fetal growth restriction
- Placental abruption
- Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS)
- Maternal overdose and death

**Maternal Opioid Use leads to:**

Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS):
- Withdrawal symptoms after birth
- Irritability, tremors
- Feeding difficulties
- Seizures (severe cases)
- Hospitalization for weeks

\`\`\`
NAS Incidence:
- Unmedicated: 50-90% of infants
- Methadone: 50-70%
- Buprenorphine: 30-50%
\`\`\`

**Treatment during pregnancy:**

**Methadone:**
- Historical standard of care
- Proven safety profile
- Requires OTP involvement
- May cause more severe NAS than buprenorphine

**Buprenorphine:**
- First-line for many patients
- Equally effective
- Less severe NAS
- Shorter hospital stay for infants
- Office-based treatment possible

**Treatment principles:**
- **MAT is strongly recommended** over detoxification
- Early treatment improves outcomes
- Combination with prenatal care essential
- Breastfeeding encouraged if stable on MAT and HIV-negative
- Close coordination with OB and addiction specialists

**Contraindicated:**
- Naltrexone (insufficient data)
- Unsupervised withdrawal (high relapse and overdose risk)

**Legal considerations:**

- May need to adjust MAT dose during acute pain
- Coordinate with pain management specialists
- Consider higher-dose buprenorphine (has pain relief properties)

**Acute pain management:**
- For surgery or trauma
- Continue MAT throughout
- May need supplemental short-acting opioids
- Higher doses often needed due to tolerance
- Multimodal analgesia preferred

### Incarcerated Populations

**The problem:**

- Medical complications
- Continued use (in some facilities)

**Risks after release:**
- Tolerance has decreased
- High overdose risk (up to 129x in first 2 weeks)
- Stressors and triggers
- Limited treatment access

**Treatment:**
- **MAT should be continued** if established
- **MAT should be initiated** if indicated
- Discharge planning essential
- Connection to community treatment
- Naloxone provision before release

**Legal developments:**
- Increasing recognition of right to MAT
- Class action lawsuits
- Policy changes in some jurisdictions

### LGBTQ+ Population

**Special considerations:**
- Higher rates of substance use
- Minority stress contributes
- Higher rates of mental health issues
- Stigma and discrimination
- Family rejection common

**Treatment needs:**
- Culturally competent care
- Use chosen name and pronouns
- Trauma-informed approach
- LGBTQ+-affirming environment
- Consider hormone therapy interactions

### Veterans

**Special considerations:**
- High rates of chronic pain
- PTSD co-occurrence common
- Trauma often central
- Military culture impacts help-seeking
- VA resources available

**Treatment approach:**
- Integrated care for pain, PTSD, OUD
- Trauma-informed
- Consider military culture
- Coordinate with VA services
- Peer support from other veterans

## Advanced Topics

### Pharmacogenomics of OUD Treatment

**Genetic variations affecting treatment:**

**OPRM1 (mu-opioid receptor)**
- A118G variant
- More common in some populations
- May affect naltrexone response
- May affect buprenorphine response

**CYP450 enzymes**
- Affects medication metabolism
- Drug-drug interactions
- Dosing considerations

**Future directions:**
- Personalized medicine based on genetics
- Not yet standard of care
- Research ongoing

### OUD and Infectious Diseases

**HIV:**
- Higher prevalence among people who inject drugs
- MAT reduces HIV risk behaviors
- MAT improves HIV treatment adherence
- Integrated treatment recommended

**Hepatitis C:**
- High prevalence among people who use opioids
- Can be cured with direct-acting antivirals
- MAT improves HCV treatment outcomes
- All patients should be screened and treated

**Hepatitis B:**
- Vaccinate all susceptible patients
- Treat if chronic infection
- Monitor liver function

**Infectious complications of injection:**
- Bacterial infections (skin, soft tissue)
