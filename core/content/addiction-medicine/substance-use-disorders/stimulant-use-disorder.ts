## What is Stimulant Use Disorder?

Stimulant Use Disorder is a medical condition characterized by problematic use of stimulant drugs that increase activity in the brain and body, leading to significant impairment or distress.

## What are Stimulants?

Stimulants are drugs that:
- Increase alertness, attention, and energy
- Elevate blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing
- Produce feelings of euphoria and confidence
- Suppress appetite

### Types of Stimulants

**Illegal Stimulants:**
- **Cocaine**: Derived from coca leaves
- **Methamphetamine**: Highly potent synthetic stimulant
- **Crack cocaine**: Smokeable form of cocaine
- **MDMA (Ecstasy/Molly)**: Combined stimulant and hallucinogen

**Prescription Stimulants:**
- **Amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (Adderall)** - ADHD treatment
- **Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta)** - ADHD treatment
- **Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)** - ADHD treatment
- **Modafinil** - Sleep disorders

**Over-the-Counter:**
- Caffeine
- Nicotine (tobacco)
- Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed)

## Why Are Stimulants Addictive?

Stimulants are highly addictive because they:
- Cause an immediate, intense euphoria
- Create feelings of confidence and power
- Provide temporary energy and focus
- Produce a powerful "crash" that leads to more use
- Rapidly change brain chemistry

## Signs of Stimulant Use Disorder

**Physical signs:**
- Dilated pupils
- Rapid heartbeat
- High blood pressure
- Increased sweating
- Teeth grinding (bruxism)
- Weight loss
- Skin sores (methamphetamine)

**Behavioral signs:**
- Excessive energy or activity
- Rapid, pressured speech
- Periods of no sleep followed by crashing
- Financial problems from buying drugs
- Risky behaviors
- Neglecting responsibilities

**Psychological signs:**
- Euphoria
- Anxiety or panic
- Paranoia
- Hallucinations (with high doses or chronic use)
- Extreme irritability
- Depression during withdrawal

## The "Crash"

After stimulant use wears off, people experience:
- Extreme fatigue
- Depression and sadness
- Increased appetite
- Irritability and agitation
- Intense cravings for more
- Suicidal thoughts (in some cases)

This crash drives continued use to avoid these negative feelings.

## Statistics

- **2 million** Americans have cocaine use disorder
- **1.5 million** use methamphetamine
- **5 million** misuse prescription stimulants
- Stimulant overdoses have increased dramatically in recent years

## Good News

**Treatment is effective:**
- Behavioral therapies show good outcomes
- Contingency management particularly effective
- Recovery rates comparable to other substances
- People can and do recover every day

**Recovery is possible:**
- Brain healing occurs over time
- Cognitive function improves
- Mood stabilizes
- Quality of life returns`,

      title: 'How Stimulants Affect the Brain and Body',
      content: `# How Stimulants Work

## The Brain's Reward System

### Dopamine: The Key Neurotransmitter

**Normal dopamine signaling:**

\`\`\`
Reward → Dopamine Release → Pleasure → Learning
   ↓                              ↓
Natural rewards             Behavior repeated
(friendship, food, achievement)
\`\`\`

**Stimulant effect:**

\`\`\`
Stimulant → Massive dopamine release (10x+ normal) → Intense euphoria
           OR
Stimulant → Blocks dopamine recycling → Dopamine builds up → Euphoria
\`\`\`

## Mechanisms of Action

### Cocaine Mechanism

\`\`\`
Cocaine blocks dopamine transporter (DAT)
    ↓
Dopamine cannot be recycled
    ↓
Dopamine builds up in synapse
    ↓
Intense stimulation of reward system
    ↓
Euphoria and reinforcement
\`\`\`

**Key points:**
- Blocks dopamine recycling
- Also affects norepinephrine and serotonin
- Effects are relatively short (15-30 minutes for cocaine)
- Rapid tolerance development

### Methamphetamine Mechanism

\`\`\`
Methamphetamine enters dopamine neuron
    ↓
Forces dopamine release from storage
    ↓
Also blocks dopamine recycling
    ↓
Also damages dopamine terminals
    ↓
Massive, prolonged dopamine increase
    ↓
Intense, long-lasting euphoria
    ↓
Neurotoxicity
\`\`\`

**Key points:**
- Causes dopamine release AND blocks recycling
- Longer duration (4-12 hours)
- More neurotoxic than cocaine
- Greater brain damage potential
- More severe psychiatric symptoms

### Prescription Stimulants (Amphetamines, Methylphenidate)

\`\`\`
Therapeutic doses: Modest dopamine increase in specific brain regions
    ↓
Improved focus, attention, impulse control
    ↓
ADHD symptom relief

Abused doses (high): Massive dopamine increase throughout brain
    ↓
Euphoria, similar to illegal stimulants
\`\`\`

**Key points:**
- Similar mechanisms to methamphetamine (but weaker)
- Therapeutic doses used for ADHD are safe and not addictive
- Misused doses can cause addiction similar to illegal stimulants

## Effects on the Body

### Immediate Effects

**Desired effects:**
- Euphoria and pleasure
- Increased energy and alertness
- Enhanced confidence

### Cardiovascular Effects

\`\`\`
Chronic stimulant use →
    ↓
Cardiovascular damage:
    - Cardiomyopathy (weakened heart muscle)
    - Arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat)
    - Hypertension (high blood pressure)
    - Myocardial infarction (heart attack)
    - Stroke
    - Aortic dissection
\`\`\`

### Neurological Effects

- Paranoia and suspiciousness
- Visual and auditory hallucinations
- Delusions (often paranoid)
- Disorganized thinking

**Factors increasing risk:**
- High doses
- Binge use
- Sleep deprivation
- Pre-existing vulnerability
- Methamphetamine more likely than cocaine

**Treatment:**

### Mood Disorders

**Stimulant-induced depression:**
- Common during withdrawal
- Can be severe
- Suicidal risk
- Typically improves with abstinence

**Anxiety disorders:**

- Can develop panic disorder
- Worsens existing anxiety
- Anxiety prominent in withdrawal

## Routes of Administration and Effects

| Route | Onset | Duration | Intensity | Risks |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Oral | 15-30 min | 2-4 hours | Low | Lowest addiction potential |
| Intranasal (snorting) | 3-5 min | 30-60 min | Medium | Nasal damage |
| Smoking (crack) | 10-15 sec | 5-15 min | High | Lung damage, high addiction |
| Injection | 15-30 sec | 15-30 min | Very High | Vein damage, HIV, hepatitis, overdose |

**Faster onset = Greater addiction potential**

## Stimulant Withdrawal

**Unlike opioid withdrawal, stimulant withdrawal:**
- Is not typically medically dangerous
- Causes significant psychological distress
- Has no FDA-approved medications
- Requires strong psychosocial support

**Withdrawal timeline:**

\`\`\`
Crash phase (hours to days after last use):
    - Extreme fatigue
    - Depression
    - Increased appetite
    - Suicidal thoughts (in some)

Withdrawal phase (days to weeks):
    - Fatigue
    - Anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure)
    - Poor concentration
    - Irritability
    - Anxiety
    - Intense cravings

Protracted withdrawal (weeks to months):
    - Mood swings
    - Sleep disturbances
    - Occasional cravings
\`\`\`

**Key difference from opioids:**
- No life-threatening physical symptoms
- Psychological symptoms can be severe
- Depression and suicide risk significant
- Longer to feel "normal" compared to opioids`,

      content: `# Treatment for Stimulant Use Disorder

## Treatment Overview

**Key challenge:** No FDA-approved medications for stimulant use disorder

**Effective treatment relies on:**
1. Behavioral therapies (primary treatment)
2. Contingency management (most effective)
3. Motivational enhancement
4. Cognitive-behavioral approaches
5. Recovery support services

## Behavioral Therapies

### 1. Contingency Management (CM)

**The most effective intervention for stimulant use disorder**

**How it works:**
- Provide tangible rewards for verified abstinence
- Usually vouchers for goods/services or prize draws
- Abstinence verified by drug testing
- Immediate reinforcement of abstinence

**Types:**

| Type | Description | Evidence |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Voucher-based | Earn vouchers redeemable for goods | Strong evidence for cocaine |
| Prize-based | Chance to win prizes with each negative test | Effective, lower cost |

**Key elements:**
- **Immediate** reinforcement (not delayed)
- **Certain** reward (not random)
- **Increasing** value (early abstinence worth more)
- **Frequent** testing (usually 2-3x/week initially)

**Why it works:**
- Stimulants hijack reward systems
- CM provides alternative rewards
- Re-trains the brain's reward system
- Builds recovery capital

**Effectiveness:**
- Doubles abstinence rates compared to counseling alone
- Effect persists after intervention ends
- Most effective evidence-based approach

## Stimulant-Induced Psychosis

### Clinical Presentation

**Symptoms:**
- Paranoia (most common)
- Persecutory delusions
- Visual hallucinations (formication - bugs under skin)
- Auditory hallucinations
- Disorganized behavior
- Aggression and violence

**Risk factors:**
- High doses
- Binge use
- Sleep deprivation
- IV use
- Methamphetamine > cocaine
- Pre-existing vulnerability
- Family history of psychosis

**Course:**
- Typically resolves with abstinence (days to weeks)
- May be persistent in some cases
- Recurs with re-use
- Can trigger primary psychotic disorder in vulnerable individuals

**Treatment:**

\`\`\`
Acute management:
    - Safe environment
    - Observation (if not dangerous)
    - Low-dose antipsychotic if needed
    - Benzodiazepines for agitation (short-term)

Abstinence-based:
    - Treatment for stimulant use disorder
    - Time for brain to heal
    - Monitor for persistence
\`\`\`

**Medication considerations:**
- Second-generation antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine)
- Lower doses typically needed
- Monitor for side effects
- Not always necessary - psychosis often resolves without

## Stimulants and Cognitive Impairment

### Areas Affected

**Attention:**
- Sustained attention impaired
- Difficulty focusing
- Easily distracted

**Memory:**
- Working memory deficits
- Verbal memory impairment
- Visual memory problems

**Executive Function:**
- Poor decision-making
- Impulse control deficits
- Planning difficulties
- Cognitive flexibility reduced

**Processing Speed:**
- Slowed information processing
- "Brain fog"

### Recovery of Function

**Timeline:**
\`\`\`
Acute withdrawal: Significant impairment
    ↓
1-4 weeks: Some improvement, still impaired
    ↓
1-3 months: Noticeable improvement
    ↓
3-12 months: Continued recovery
    ↓
12+ months: Near-normal or normal function (for most)
\`\`\`

**Factors affecting recovery:**
- Duration of use
- Amount used
- Route of administration
- Age
- Co-occurring disorders
- Methamphetamine more damaging than cocaine

### Treatment Implications

**Assessment:**
- Screen for cognitive impairment
- Consider neurocognitive testing if problems noted
- Document baseline

**Treatment adaptations:**
- Simplify instructions
- Repeat important information
- Use written materials
- Include family members
- More concrete, less abstract
- Longer treatment may be needed

## Stimulants and Cardiovascular Disease

### Acute Cardiovascular Effects

**Cocaine:**
- Sympathetic nervous system activation
- Increased heart rate, blood pressure
- Vasospasm
- Increased myocardial oxygen demand
- Can cause: MI, arrhythmias, aortic dissection, stroke

**Methamphetamine:**
- Similar effects to cocaine
- More direct cardiac toxicity
- Can cause cardiomyopathy
- Pulmonary hypertension

### Chronic Cardiovascular Complications

**Conditions:**
- Accelerated atherosclerosis
- Cardiomyopathy (weakened heart muscle)
- Arrhythmias
- Hypertension
- Valvular disease (injection-related endocarditis)
- Heart failure

### Assessment

**Cardiovascular workup:**
- ECG (look for conduction abnormalities)
- Echocardiogram (if cardiomyopathy suspected)
- Cardiac enzymes (if chest pain)
- Stress testing (if indicated)

### Treatment Considerations

**For patients with cardiovascular disease:**
- Abstinence is critical
- Cardiology consultation
- Standard cardiac treatments apply
- Avoid stimulant medications (including ADHD meds)

**For chest pain in cocaine users:**
- Benzodiazepines first-line (reduce sympathetic activity)
- Nitroglycerin
- Avoid beta-blockers (unopposed alpha stimulation)
- Calcium channel blockers preferred

## Prescription Stimulant Misuse

### Epidemiology

**Who misuses:**
- College students (academic performance)
- Athletes (performance enhancement)
- Truck drivers/shift workers (stay awake)
- People with eating disorders (appetite suppression)
- People seeking euphoria

**Rates:**
- 5-10% of college students misuse prescription stimulants
- Increasing in recent years
- Diversion from legitimate prescriptions common

### Patterns of Misuse

**Non-medical use of prescribed medication:**
- Taking higher doses than prescribed
- Taking more frequently than prescribed
- Using for effects other than intended

**Use of someone else's medication:**
- Borrowing/buying from friends
- Most common pattern on college campuses

**Use for recreation:**
- Crushing and snorting oral medications
- Injecting oral medications (dangerous)

### Assessment Challenges

**ADHD vs. Misuse:**

\`\`\`
Legitimate ADHD treatment:
    - Careful diagnosis
    - Appropriate dosing
    - Symptom improvement
    - Functional improvement
    - Stable pattern

Misuse:
    - No diagnosis or improper diagnosis
    - Escalating doses
    - Seeking euphoria
    - Functional decline
    - Chaotic pattern
\`\`\`

### Treatment of Prescription Stimulant Use Disorder

**Approach:**
- Similar to illegal stimulant use disorder
- Behavioral therapies
- Contingency management
- May need treatment for underlying ADHD with non-stimulants

**Non-stimulant ADHD medications:**
- Atomoxetine (Strattera)
- Guanfacine (Intuniv)
- Clonidine (Kapvay)
- Bupropion (Wellbutrin)

## Stimulants in Special Populations

### Women

**Special considerations:**
- Faster progression ("telescoping")
- Different patterns of use (e.g., weight control)
- Higher rates of depression
- Trauma history common
- Pregnancy concerns

**Pregnancy:**
- Stimulants cross placenta
- Risks: preterm labor, placental abruption, fetal growth restriction
- Methamphetamine causes more severe effects
- No FDA-approved medications
- Behavioral treatment

### LGBTQ+ Population

**Methamphetamine in men who have sex with men (MSM):**
- High rates of methamphetamine use
- Associated with high-risk sexual behavior
- HIV transmission risk
- Minority stress contributes
- Culturally competent treatment needed

**Approach:**
- Non-judgmental
- Harm reduction
- Culturally competent
- LGBT-affirming environment
- Address sexual health

### Older Adults

**Increasing concern:**
- Aging stimulant users from earlier epidemics
- Cardiovascular risks more pronounced
- Cognitive changes may be more severe
- Medical comorbidities
- Atypical presentation (confusion, falls)

### Adolescents and Young Adults

**Special considerations:**
- Brain still developing
- More sensitive to stimulant effects
- Academic pressures contribute to misuse
- Family involvement essential
- Age-appropriate treatment

## Polysubstance Use with Stimulants

### Common Combinations

**Stimulants + Alcohol:**
- Combines depressant and stimulant effects
- Can drink more, feel less drunk
- More alcohol toxicity
- More risk-taking
- Worse hangover

**Stimulants + Opioids ("Speedball"):**
- Cocaine + heroin (classic speedball)
- Methamphetamine + opioids
- Masks opioid overdose symptoms
- Increases overdose risk
- Increases cardiovascular risk

**Stimulants + Benzodiazepines:**
- Common in methamphetamine users
- To come down from stimulant effects
- Benzodiazepine use disorder risk
- Medical risks

**Stimulants + Marijuana:**
- May reduce some negative effects
- May increase impairment
- Complex interactions

### Assessment and Treatment

**Identify all substances:**
- Comprehensive drug screen
- Clinical interview about all substance use
- Consider all substances in treatment planning

**Integrated treatment:**
- Address all substances simultaneously
- Prioritize most dangerous
- Consider interactions

## Stimulants and the Legal System

### Criminal Justice Involvement

**Common charges:**
- Possession
- Distribution
- Drug-related property crimes
- Violent crimes (especially with methamphetamine)

**Treatment in criminal justice settings:**
- Effective at reducing recidivism
- Reduces drug use
- Improves outcomes
- Should be prioritized over incarceration alone

### Drug Courts

**Specialized courts:**
- Diversion to treatment instead of incarceration
- Supervised treatment
- Regular drug testing
- Judicial oversight
- Effective for stimulant users

## Emerging Issues

### Novel Psychoactive Substances (NPS)

**Synthetic cathinones ("Bath salts"):**
- MDPV, mephedrone, methylone
- Similar effects to amphetamines
- Variable potency and purity
- Dangerous effects reported

**Considerations:**
- Often unknown substances
- Drug screens may not detect
- Treat symptomatically
- Assume stimulant effects

### Flakka (alpha-PVP)

**Effects:**
