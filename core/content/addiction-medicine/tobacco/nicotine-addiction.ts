## What is Nicotine Addiction?

Nicotine addiction (Tobacco Use Disorder) is a chronic condition characterized by compulsive tobacco use despite harmful consequences. Nicotine is the addictive substance in tobacco products.

## What is Nicotine?

Nicotine is a natural chemical found in tobacco leaves:
- Stimulates the brain
- Creates dependence
- Causes addiction
- Makes quitting difficult

## Tobacco Products

      content: `# How Nicotine Affects the Body

## Nicotine's Journey Through the Body

### Absorption and Distribution

**Smoking (cigarettes):**
\`\`\`
Inhale → Lungs → Bloodstream → Brain (7-10 seconds)
\`\`\`

**Vaping:**
\`\`\`
Inhale aerosol → Lungs → Bloodstream → Brain (5-30 seconds)
\`\`\`

**Smokeless tobacco:**
\`\`\`
Mouth membranes → Bloodstream → Brain (3-5 minutes)
\`\`\`

**Nicotine patch:**
\`\`\`
Skin → Bloodstream → Steady delivery (hours)
\`\`\`

**Nicotine reaches the brain faster with smoking than any other route**

## Effects on the Brain

### The Reward System

**Normal brain function:**
\`\`\'
Natural rewards (food, social interaction) → Moderate dopamine release → Pleasure
\`\`\'

**With nicotine:**
\`\`\'
Nicotine → Massive dopamine release → Intense reinforcement → Addiction
\`\`\'

### Neurotransmitters Affected

**Dopamine:**
- Primary reward neurotransmitter
- Creates pleasure and reinforcement
- Drives addiction

**Norepinephrine:**
- Increases alertness
- Improves concentration
- Reduces appetite

**Serotonin:**
- Affects mood
- Reduces anxiety (temporarily)
- May contribute to addiction

**Acetylcholine:**
- Improves attention
- Enhances memory
- Involved in arousal

**GABA:**
- Inhibitory neurotransmitter
- Reduces anxiety
- Contributes to relaxation effects

**Glutamate:**
- Involved in learning and memory
- Creates associations with smoking
- Strengthens addiction

## Brain Changes from Nicotine

### Upregulation of Nicotine Receptors

\`\`\'
Chronic nicotine exposure → Brain increases nicotine receptors
    ↓
More receptors needed for same effect (tolerance)
    ↓
Higher doses required
    ↓
Stronger addiction
\`\`\'

### Desensitization

**With repeated exposure:**
- Receptors become less sensitive
- More nicotine needed
- Contributes to tolerance
- Makes quitting harder
