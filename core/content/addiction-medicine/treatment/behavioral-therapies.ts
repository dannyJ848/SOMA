## What is CBT?

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy** is a structured, goal-oriented therapy that focuses on the connections between:
- **Thoughts** (what we think)
- **Feelings** (how we feel)
- **Behaviors** (what we do)

**Basic principle:**
\`\`\'
Our thoughts influence our feelings and behaviors
    ↓
By changing our thoughts, we can change feelings and behaviors
\`\`\`

## How CBT Works for Addiction

### The CBT Model

**For substance use:**

\`\`\'
Trigger or situation
    ↓
Thoughts about using
    ↓
Feelings (craving, anxiety, etc.)
    ↓
Behavior: Using substances
    ↓
Consequences
\`\`\`

**CBT interrupts this cycle:**
\`\`\'
Trigger
    ↓
Identify thoughts
    ↓
Challenge and change thoughts
    ↓
New feelings
    ↓
New behaviors (coping skills)
    ↓
Better consequences
\`\`\`

## Core Components of CBT

### 1. Functional Analysis

**Understanding substance use patterns:**

\`\`\'
Identify triggers:
    - People
    - Places
    - Things
    - Feelings
    - Situations

    ↓

Understand patterns:
    - When do you use?
    - Where do you use?
    - Who are you with?
    - What are you feeling?
    - What do you think?

    ↓

Understand consequences:
    - Immediate
    - Short-term
    - Long-term
    - Positive
    - Negative
\`\`\`

### 2. Coping Skills Training

**Learning new ways to handle triggers:**

**Refusal skills:**
- How to say no to offers
- Practice in session
- Handle social pressure
- Manage guilt

**Craving management:**
- "Urge surfing" - riding out cravings
- Distraction techniques
- Remembering reasons for quitting
- Delaying use (cravings pass)

**Stress management:**

### 3. Cognitive Restructuring

**Identifying and changing thoughts:**

**Common thinking errors:**

## Motivational Interviewing (MI)

### What is Motivational Interviewing?

**Definition:**
A client-centered, directive method for enhancing intrinsic motivation to change by exploring and resolving ambivalence.

**Core spirit of MI:**
- Partnership (collaboration)
- Evocation (drawing out ideas from client)
- Compassion (promoting client's welfare)
- Acceptance (affirming client)

### Principles of MI

### 1. Express Empathy

**Demonstrate understanding:**
- Listen reflectively
- Understand client's perspective
- Acknowledge feelings
- Validate experiences

**Reflective listening:**
\`\`\'
Client: "I know I should quit, but I enjoy drinking with friends"
Reflection: "Part of you wants to quit, but another part enjoys the social connection with friends"
\`\`\`

### 2. Develop Discrepancy

**Help client see difference:**

\`\`\'
Current behavior
    ↓
VS
Goals and values
    ↓
Discrepancy creates motivation
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\'
Client: "I want to be healthy"
Therapist: "And how does your current opioid use fit with your goal of being healthy?"
\`\`\'

### 3. Avoid Argumentation

**Roll with resistance:**

\`\`\'
If client argues:
    - Don't argue back
    - Reflect the resistance
    - Shift perspective
    - Find common ground
\`\`\`

**Example:**
\`\`\'
Client: "I don't have a problem with drinking"
Instead of: "Yes you do, look at the consequences"
Try: "You're not convinced that drinking is causing problems"
\`\`\'

### 4. Support Self-Efficacy

**Build confidence:**
- Believe in client's ability to change
- Highlight strengths
- Point out past successes
- Normalize ambivalence

### OARS Skills

**Open-ended questions:**
- "What are your concerns about your substance use?"
- "How would you like your life to be different?"
- "What are some of the good things about your substance use? The not-so-good things?"

**Affirmations:**
- "You've shown a lot of strength in dealing with this"
- "It's clear you care about your family"
- "You've given this a lot of thought"

**Reflections:**
- Simple reflections: "You're feeling frustrated"
- Double-sided: "On one hand... on the other hand..."
- Amplified: "It sounds really concerning to you"

**Summaries:**
- Collect key points
- Demonstrate listening
- Bridge to next topic
- Check for accuracy

### MI Strategies

**Eliciting change talk:**
- Ask evocative questions
- Explore importance
- Discuss confidence
- Look forward
- Explore past success

**Responding to change talk:**
- Reflect it
- Elaborate it
- Affirm it
- Reinforce it

**Responding to sustain talk:**
- Reflection
- Emphasize personal choice
- Reframe
\`\`\'Client: "I could never quit"
Therapist: "You're not sure if quitting is something you could do right now"
\`\`\'

## Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)

## Contingency Management

### What is Contingency Management?

**Definition:**
Providing tangible rewards to reinforce abstinence and other treatment-related behaviors.

### How It Works

**Basic principle:**

\`\`\'
Target behavior (abstinence)
    ↓
Verified by testing
    ↓
Immediate reward provided
    ↓
Behavior reinforced
    ↓
Behavior increases
\`\`\`

### Types of Contingency Management

**Voucher-Based Reinforcement:**
\`\`\'
Abstinent → Earn voucher worth money
    ↓
Vouchers increase with consecutive negative tests
    ↓
Can purchase goods and services
    ↓
Reset after positive test
\`\`\`

**Prize-Based Contingency Management:**
\`\`\'
Abstinent → Earn chance to draw for prizes

Reset after positive test
\`\`\'
