      "summary": "Seasonal allergies happen when your body reacts to pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds during certain times of year, causing sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes.",
      "explanation": "Seasonal allergies, often called 'hay fever,' happen when tiny pollen grains from plants get into your nose and eyes. Your immune system thinks the pollen is harmful and tries to fight it off, which causes symptoms.\n\n**Common Symptoms:**\n- Sneezing, often in fits\n- Runny or stuffy nose\n- Itchy, watery, red eyes\n- Itchy throat or ears\n- Feeling tired\n- Headaches\n\n**When Different Pollens Are High:**\n- **Spring (March-May)**: Tree pollen (oak, birch, maple, cedar)\n- **Late Spring to Summer (May-July)**: Grass pollen (Bermuda, timothy, Kentucky bluegrass)\n- **Late Summer to Fall (August-October)**: Weed pollen (ragweed is the biggest culprit)\n\n**Simple Ways to Feel Better:**\n- Check pollen counts in your area (available online and in weather apps)\n- Stay inside when pollen is highest (usually early morning)\n- Keep windows closed during pollen season\n- Shower and change clothes after being outside\n- Use air conditioning instead of opening windows\n- Over-the-counter allergy medicines can help (antihistamines, nasal sprays)\n\n**Pollen vs. Cold:**\nAllergies are NOT contagious like a cold. If your symptoms last more than 10 days and you don't have a fever, it's probably allergies, not a cold.",

      "summary": "Seasonal allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated inflammatory condition triggered by outdoor aeroallergens, with symptoms following predictable patterns based on regional pollen seasons and weather conditions.",
      "explanation": "**Pathophysiology**\nSeasonal allergic rhinitis results from IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to pollen allergens:\n1. Pollen grains deposit on nasal mucosa\n2. Allergens are released and penetrate epithelium\n3. Cross-linking of IgE on mast cells triggers degranulation\n4. Histamine and other mediators cause immediate symptoms\n5. Late-phase response (4-8 hours later) with eosinophil infiltration\n\n**Regional Pollen Patterns (North America)**\n\n*Tree Pollen (February-May)*\n- Early: Cedar, juniper, elm\n- Mid: Birch, oak, maple, ash\n- Late: Walnut, mulberry\n\n*Grass Pollen (May-July)*\n- Major: Timothy, orchard, Kentucky bluegrass, Bermuda\n- Southern regions: Longer season\n\n*Weed Pollen (August-October)*\n- Ragweed: Most significant (peak mid-September)\n- Sagebrush, pigweed, lamb's quarters\n- Single ragweed plant produces 1 billion pollen grains\n\n**Symptoms by Severity**\n\n*Mild*\n- Intermittent symptoms\n- No sleep disturbance\n- Normal work/school performance\n\n*Moderate-Severe*\n- Persistent daily symptoms\n- Sleep disruption\n- Impaired concentration, productivity\n- Affects quality of life\n\n**Associated Conditions**\n- Allergic conjunctivitis (50-70% of patients)\n- Asthma (20-40% of allergic rhinitis patients have asthma)\n- Sinusitis (inflammation can block sinus drainage)\n- Otitis media with effusion\n- Oral allergy syndrome (cross-reactivity with foods)\n\n**Treatment Approach**\n1. Allergen avoidance (see practical tips)\n2. Pharmacotherapy\n   - Intranasal corticosteroids: Most effective for nasal symptoms\n   - Oral antihistamines: Good for sneezing, itching, runny nose\n   - Intranasal antihistamines: Alternative for congestion\n   - Decongestants: Short-term use only\n   - Eye drops: For ocular symptoms\n3.
