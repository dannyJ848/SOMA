      "explanation": "Your body has a defense system called the immune system. Its job is to fight off germs that could make you sick. But sometimes, this system makes a mistake. It thinks something harmless - like dust, peanuts, or cat fur - is dangerous.\n\nWhen this happens, your body goes into 'fight mode' even though there's no real threat. This causes allergy symptoms like:\n- Sneezing and runny nose\n- Itchy, watery eyes\n- Skin rashes or hives\n- Stomach problems\n- In serious cases, trouble breathing\n\nThe things that trigger allergies are called allergens. Common allergens include:\n- Pollen from trees, grass, and weeds\n- Dust mites (tiny bugs you can't see)\n- Pet dander (tiny flakes of skin from animals)\n- Certain foods like peanuts, milk, or eggs\n- Insect stings\n- Some medicines\n\nAllergies are very common - about 1 in 4 people have them. You can develop allergies at any age, though many start in childhood. The good news is that allergies can be managed, and there are many ways to feel better.",

      "explanation": "**How Allergies Develop**\nAllergies involve two stages:\n\n1. **Sensitization** (First Exposure)\n   - Your immune system encounters an allergen for the first time\n   - It wrongly identifies this substance as harmful\n   - Your body produces antibodies called Immunoglobulin E (IgE) specific to that allergen\n   - These IgE antibodies attach to mast cells (immune cells in your tissues)\n   - You don't have symptoms yet - your body is just 'learning' the allergen\n\n2. **Allergic Reaction** (Later Exposures)\n   - When you encounter the allergen again, it binds to the IgE antibodies\n   - This triggers mast cells to release chemicals, especially histamine\n   - These chemicals cause allergy symptoms\n\n**Why Symptoms Vary**\nSymptoms depend on where the allergen enters your body:\n- **Inhaled allergens** (pollen, dust): Affect nose, eyes, lungs - cause sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, coughing\n- **Ingested allergens** (food): Affect mouth, stomach, intestines - cause itching, swelling, nausea, diarrhea\n- **Skin contact** (poison ivy, latex): Cause rashes, hives, itching\n- **Injected allergens** (insect stings, medications): Can cause widespread reactions\n\n**Who Gets Allergies**\nRisk factors include:\n- Family history of allergies (genetics play a major role)\n- Having other allergic conditions (asthma, eczema)\n- Childhood exposure patterns\n- Environmental factors",

      "explanation": "**Immunological Basis of Allergic Disease**\n\nAllergic reactions are classified as Type I (immediate) hypersensitivity reactions in the Gell and Coombs classification.\n\n**Sensitization Phase**\n1. Allergen uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), particularly dendritic cells\n2. Allergen processing and presentation to naive CD4+ T cells\n3. Differentiation into TH2 cells (driven by IL-4, absence of IL-12)\n4. TH2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-13, promoting B cell class switching to IgE\n5. Plasma cells secrete allergen-specific IgE\n6. IgE binds to high-affinity FcεRI receptors on mast cells and basophils\n\n**Effector Phase - Immediate Response (Minutes)**\nRe-exposure to allergen causes:\n1. Cross-linking of surface-bound IgE by multivalent allergen\n2. Aggregation of FcεRI receptors\n3. Mast cell degranulation releasing:\n   - **Preformed mediators**: Histamine, tryptase, heparin, TNF-α\n   - **Newly synthesized lipid mediators**: Prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4)\n\n**Late-Phase Response (4-24 hours)**\n- Cytokine production (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) by mast cells and TH2 cells\n- Eosinophil recruitment and activation\n- Tissue inflammation and remodeling\n\n**Clinical Manifestations by Organ System**\n- **Upper airway**: Allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis\n- **Lower airway**: Allergic asthma (bronchospasm, mucus hypersecretion)\n- **Skin**: Urticaria, angioedema, atopic dermatitis\n- **Gastrointestinal**: Food allergy symptoms\n- **Systemic**: Anaphylaxis",
