# Arrhythmias

## Overview

Arrhythmias are problems with your heart's rhythm - the electrical system that controls your heartbeat. Your heart may beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly. Many arrhythmias are harmless, but some require treatment to prevent complications like stroke or heart failure.

## Atrial Fibrillation

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**What is Atrial Fibrillation (AFib)?**

AFib is the most common abnormal heart rhythm. In AFib:
- The top chambers of your heart (atria) quiver instead of beating normally
- Your heart beats irregularly and often too fast
- Blood doesn't flow as well through your heart

**Why It Matters:**
- Can cause blood clots that lead to stroke
- Can make your heart weaker over time
- May cause symptoms like palpitations, fatigue, shortness of breath

**Treatment Goals:**
1. Prevent stroke (blood thinners)
2. Control heart rate
3. Possibly restore normal rhythm

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Types of Atrial Fibrillation:**

| Type | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Paroxysmal** | Comes and goes | Stops on its own within 7 days |
| **Persistent** | Continues until treated | Lasts more than 7 days |
| **Long-standing persistent** | Continuous | More than 12 months |
| **Permanent** | Accepted as the rhythm | Decision made not to pursue rhythm control |

**Symptoms:**
- Palpitations (heart racing, fluttering, or pounding)
- Fatigue and weakness
- Shortness of breath
- Lightheadedness or dizziness
- Chest discomfort
- Reduced exercise tolerance
- Some people have no symptoms

**Stroke Prevention with Blood Thinners:**
AFib increases stroke risk 5x because blood can pool in the heart and form clots. Blood thinners (anticoagulants) reduce this risk by 60-70%.

| Type | Examples | Monitoring Needed |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| Warfarin | Coumadin | Regular blood tests (INR) |
| DOACs | Eliquis, Xarelto, Pradaxa | No routine monitoring |

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**CHA₂DS₂-VASc Score for Stroke Risk:**

| Risk Factor | Points |
|-------------|--------|
| **C**ongestive heart failure | 1 |
| **H**ypertension | 1 |
| **A**ge ≥75 | 2 |
| **D**iabetes | 1 |
| **S**troke/TIA/thromboembolism | 2 |
| **V**ascular disease | 1 |
| **A**ge 65-74 | 1 |
| **S**ex category (female) | 1 |

**Anticoagulation Recommendations:**
| Score (Men/Women) | Annual Stroke Risk | Recommendation |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 0 / 1 | ~0-1% | No anticoagulation or aspirin |
| 1 / 2 | ~1-2% | Consider anticoagulation |
| ≥2 / ≥3 | 2-10%+ | Anticoagulation recommended |

**HAS-BLED Score for Bleeding Risk:**
- **H**ypertension (uncontrolled)
- **A**bnormal renal/liver function
- **S**troke history
- **B**leeding history or predisposition
- **L**abile INR (warfarin patients)
- **E**lderly (>65)
- **D**rugs/alcohol

Score ≥3 = High bleeding risk - doesn't mean avoid anticoagulation, but optimize modifiable factors.

**Rate vs. Rhythm Control:**

| Strategy | Goal | Medications | Procedures |
|----------|------|-------------|------------|
| **Rate control** | HR <110 bpm at rest | Beta-blockers, calcium blockers, digoxin | AV node ablation with pacemaker |
| **Rhythm control** | Maintain sinus rhythm | Antiarrhythmics (flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, amiodarone, dofetilide) | Cardioversion, catheter ablation |

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**AFib Pathophysiology:**

**Triggers (Pulmonary Veins):**
- Ectopic foci in pulmonary vein sleeves initiate most paroxysmal AFib
- Basis for pulmonary vein isolation ablation

**Substrate (Atrial Remodeling):**
- "AFib begets AFib" - electrical and structural remodeling perpetuate arrhythmia
- Atrial fibrosis, dilatation, and electrical heterogeneity
- Shorter refractory periods allow multiple wavelet re-entry

**Risk Factors for Development:**
- Hypertension (most common)
- Obesity
- Sleep apnea
- Alcohol ("holiday heart")
- Heart failure
- Valvular disease (especially mitral)
- Thyroid disease
- Genetics (familial AF)

**AFFIRM and RACE Trials:**
Rate control vs. rhythm control: No mortality difference with rhythm control using antiarrhythmics. However:
- Sinus rhythm independently associated with better outcomes
- Antiarrhythmics cause adverse effects that offset rhythm benefit
- Led to more aggressive ablation strategies

**EAST-AFNET 4 Trial:**
Early rhythm control (within 1 year of diagnosis) reduced cardiovascular events compared to rate control alone. Shifted guideline recommendations toward earlier rhythm control, especially with ablation.

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Contemporary AFib Management:**

**Catheter Ablation:**
- Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is cornerstone
- Techniques: Radiofrequency (point-by-point), cryoballoon, pulsed field ablation (PFA)
- CABANA trial: Ablation superior to drugs for symptom control
- CASTLE-AF: Ablation improved mortality in HFrEF with AFib
- First-line therapy option in symptomatic paroxysmal AFib

**Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion:**
- WATCHMAN device for patients with contraindication to long-term anticoagulation
- PROTECT AF, PREVAIL trials: Non-inferior to warfarin
- Does NOT eliminate short-term anticoagulation need post-procedure
- Ongoing trials with DOAC comparison

**Anticoagulation Selection:**

| DOAC | Renal Dosing | Reversal Agent | Unique Features |
|------|--------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Apixaban | 2.5 mg if 2 of: age ≥80, wt ≤60 kg, Cr ≥1.5 | Andexanet alfa | Most studied in elderly, low bleeding |
| Rivaroxaban | 15 mg if CrCl 15-50 | Andexanet alfa | Once daily, with food |
| Dabigatran | 75 mg if CrCl 15-30 | Idarucizumab | Dialyzable |
| Edoxaban | 30 mg if CrCl 15-50, wt ≤60 kg, or P-gp inhibitor | Andexanet alfa | Avoid if CrCl >95 |

**Perioperative Anticoagulation:**
Based on procedural bleeding risk and CHA₂DS₂-VASc score:
- Low risk procedures: Continue anticoagulation
- Moderate risk: Brief interruption without bridging
- High thrombotic risk: Consider bridging with heparin (rare with DOACs)

## Other Arrhythmias

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**Fast Heart Rhythms (Tachycardias):**

**Atrial Flutter:**
- Similar to AFib but more organized
- Heart beats regularly but fast (often 150 bpm)
- Also needs blood thinners to prevent stroke
- Often curable with ablation

**SVT (Supraventricular Tachycardia):**
- Sudden episodes of fast, regular heartbeat
- Starts and stops abruptly
- Usually not dangerous
- Can often stop with maneuvers (bearing down, cold water on face)
- Very curable with ablation

**Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):**
- Serious rhythm from lower heart chambers
- Can cause fainting or cardiac arrest
- May need ICD (defibrillator)
- Requires prompt evaluation

**Slow Heart Rhythms (Bradycardias):**

**Sick Sinus Syndrome:**
- Natural pacemaker not working well
- Heart beats too slowly
- May need a pacemaker

**Heart Block:**
- Electrical signals blocked between heart chambers
- Different degrees (first, second, third)
- May need a pacemaker

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Supraventricular Tachycardias:**

| Type | Mechanism | Rate | Treatment |
|------|-----------|------|-----------|
| **Sinus tachycardia** | Normal response | 100-180 | Treat underlying cause |
| **AVNRT** | Re-entry circuit in AV node | 150-250 | Adenosine, ablation |
| **AVRT** | Accessory pathway (e.g., WPW) | 150-250 | Ablation |
| **Atrial tachycardia** | Automatic focus in atrium | 100-250 | Medications, ablation |
| **Atrial flutter** | Macro-re-entry in atrium | 150 (2:1), 75-100 (controlled) | Ablation (90%+ cure) |

**Vagal Maneuvers for SVT:**
1. **Valsalva maneuver:** Bear down as if having a bowel movement for 15-20 seconds
2. **Modified Valsalva:** Bear down, then lie flat with legs raised
3. **Cold water:** Apply ice or cold water to face
4. **Carotid massage:** Only by healthcare providers

**Ventricular Arrhythmias:**

| Type | Risk | Symptoms | Treatment |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| **PVCs** (premature beats) | Usually benign | Skipped beats, palpitations | Reassurance, beta-blockers if frequent |
| **Non-sustained VT** | Depends on heart function | May be asymptomatic | Evaluate heart, possible ICD if EF low |
| **Sustained VT** | Dangerous | Palpitations, syncope, cardiac arrest | Cardioversion, ICD, ablation |
| **VF** | Cardiac arrest | Sudden death | Immediate defibrillation, ICD |

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Bradyarrhythmias:**

**Sinus Node Dysfunction:**
| Pattern | Description | Treatment |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Sinus bradycardia | Rate <60, may be normal (athletes) | Pacemaker if symptomatic |
| Sinus pause | Temporary failure to fire | Pacemaker if ≥3 seconds or symptomatic |
| Tachy-brady syndrome | Alternating fast and slow rates | Pacemaker + medications for tachycardia |
| Chronotropic incompetence | Inadequate rate response to exercise | Rate-adaptive pacemaker |

**AV Conduction Blocks:**
| Degree | ECG Finding | Significance | Treatment |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| First-degree | PR >200 ms, all P waves conduct | Usually benign | None usually |
| Second-degree Mobitz I | Progressive PR prolongation then dropped beat | Often benign (vagal tone) | Pacemaker if symptomatic |
| Second-degree Mobitz II | Constant PR then sudden dropped beat | High-grade, can progress | Pacemaker recommended |
| Third-degree (complete) | No relationship between P and QRS | Escape rhythm required | Pacemaker required |

**Causes of Bradycardia:**
- Medications: Beta-blockers, calcium blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmics
- Degenerative conduction system disease
- Ischemia (especially inferior MI)
- Infiltrative diseases (sarcoidosis, amyloidosis)
- Lyme disease
- Increased vagal tone (athletes, sleep)
- Post-cardiac surgery

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) Syndrome:**

**Anatomy:**
- Accessory pathway (Bundle of Kent) connects atrium and ventricle
- Bypasses normal AV node delay
- Pre-excitation: Short PR, delta wave, wide QRS

**Clinical Presentations:**
1. **Orthodromic AVRT:** Narrow complex, antegrade through AV node, retrograde through pathway
2. **Antidromic AVRT:** Wide complex, antegrade through pathway
3. **Pre-excited AFib:** Irregularly irregular, wide complex, can degenerate to VF

**Danger of AV Node Blocking Drugs in WPW:**
- In pre-excited AFib, blocking AV node leaves only pathway conduction
- Pathways with short refractory periods can conduct very rapidly
- May cause VF
- **AVOID adenosine, beta-blockers, calcium blockers, digoxin in wide-complex irregular tachycardia**
- Use procainamide or cardioversion

**Risk Stratification:**
- Electrophysiology study to measure pathway refractory period
- High-risk pathway (SPERRI <250 ms) → ablation recommended
- Symptomatic WPW → ablation recommended
- Asymptomatic with high-risk features → ablation considered

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Inherited Arrhythmia Syndromes:**

**Long QT Syndrome (LQTS):**
| Type | Gene | Channel | Triggers | Treatment |
|------|------|---------|----------|-----------|
| LQT1 | KCNQ1 | IKs | Exercise (swimming) | Beta-blockers highly effective |
| LQT2 | KCNH2 | IKr | Sudden noises, emotion | Beta-blockers, avoid QT-prolonging drugs |
| LQT3 | SCN5A | INa | Sleep, rest | Beta-blockers less effective, mexiletine |

- QTc prolongation: >470 ms (males), >480 ms (females)
- Risk of Torsades de Pointes → VF
- Avoid QT-prolonging medications (crediblemeds.org)
- ICD for secondary prevention or high-risk features

## Pacemakers

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**What is a Pacemaker?**

A pacemaker is a small device placed under your skin that helps your heart beat at the right pace.

**You might need a pacemaker if:**
- Your heart beats too slowly
- Your heart pauses
- The electrical signals in your heart are blocked

**How It Works:**
- A small generator (like a small watch) is placed under your collarbone
- Thin wires (leads) go into your heart
- The device sends electrical signals to make your heart beat
- It only works when needed - senses when your heart is too slow

**Living with a Pacemaker:**
- Can do most normal activities
- Avoid strong magnets (MRI needs special precautions)
- Tell security at airports you have a device
- Keep cell phone away from the device
- Carry your device ID card
- Regular check-ups to monitor the device

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Types of Pacemakers:**

| Type | Leads | Used For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Single-chamber (VVI)** | 1 (right ventricle) | Simple bradycardia |
| **Dual-chamber (DDD)** | 2 (right atrium + right ventricle) | AV block, maintains AV synchrony |
| **Biventricular (CRT)** | 3 (RA + RV + LV) | Heart failure with wide QRS |
| **Leadless** | None (capsule in heart) | Single-chamber pacing, less invasive |

**Pacemaker Settings:**
- **Rate:** How fast it paces when needed
- **Output:** How strong the electrical signal is
- **Sensitivity:** How well it senses your own heartbeat
- **Mode:** How it responds to your heart's signals (e.g., DDD, VVI)

**What to Expect After Implant:**
- Overnight hospital stay usually
- Arm movement restrictions for 4-6 weeks (lifting, raising arm)
- Wound care instructions
- Device check before discharge
- Follow-up in 1-2 weeks
- Remote monitoring setup

**Warning Signs to Report:**
- Fever, redness, swelling, or drainage at the site
- Return of dizziness or fainting
- Persistent hiccups (lead issue)
- Muscle twitching in chest
- Shortness of breath

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Pacemaker Indications:**

| Condition | Indication | Pacemaker Type |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| Complete heart block | Symptomatic or asymptomatic | Dual-chamber |
| Mobitz II second-degree block | Even if asymptomatic | Dual-chamber |
| Sinus node dysfunction | Symptomatic | Dual-chamber preferred |
| Tachy-brady syndrome | Need for rate control drugs | Dual-chamber |
| Post-AV node ablation | Required | Pacemaker (often CRT if HF) |
| Chronotropic incompetence | Symptomatic | Rate-responsive mode |

**Pacemaker Modes (NBG Code):**

| Letter | Position | Meaning |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 1st | Chamber paced | A, V, D (dual), O (none) |
| 2nd | Chamber sensed | A, V, D, O |
| 3rd | Response to sensing | I (inhibit), T (trigger), D (both), O |
| 4th | Rate response | R (rate responsive), O (none) |

Example: **DDDR**
- D: Paces both chambers (A and V)
- D: Senses both chambers
- D: Inhibits pacing if senses native beat, triggers V after A
- R: Rate responsive (increases rate with activity)

**Pacemaker Syndrome:**
Loss of AV synchrony (VVI pacing in patients with intact sinus function) can cause:
- Fatigue
- Dyspnea
- Pulsations in neck
- Hypotension
- Treatment: Upgrade to dual-chamber pacing

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**His Bundle Pacing (HBP) and Left Bundle Branch Area Pacing (LBBAP):**

**Rationale:**
- Traditional RV apical pacing causes dyssynchrony (LBBB pattern)
- Can lead to pacing-induced cardiomyopathy in 10-20%
- Physiological pacing maintains normal activation

**His Bundle Pacing:**
- Lead placed at His bundle
- Maintains native conduction
- Can correct LBBB in some patients
- Challenges: Higher thresholds, potential for loss of capture

**Left Bundle Branch Area Pacing:**
- Lead in septum captures left bundle
- More stable thresholds than HBP
- Can provide resynchronization
- Emerging as preferred physiological pacing strategy

**Leadless Pacemakers:**
- Micra (Medtronic): RV only, no AV synchrony
- Micra AV: Uses accelerometer to provide functional AV synchrony
- Aveir (Abbott): Dual-chamber leadless system (Aveir AR + Aveir VR)
- Advantages: No pocket, no leads, reduced infection risk
- Limitations: Battery life, extraction if needed

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Pacemaker Troubleshooting:**

| Problem | ECG Finding | Causes | Solutions |
|---------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Failure to pace | No pacing spike when expected | Lead fracture, battery depletion, oversensing | Interrogate, increase output, lead revision |
| Failure to capture | Pacing spike without QRS | Lead dislodgement, high threshold, battery | Increase output, lead revision |
| Failure to sense | Pacing into native beats | Sensitivity too low, lead issue | Increase sensitivity, lead revision |
| Oversensing | Inappropriate inhibition | T-wave sensing, EMI, lead fracture | Adjust sensitivity, lead revision |
| Pacemaker-mediated tachycardia | Tracking retrograde P waves | PMT | Extend PVARP, mode switch |

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Pacemakers:**
- MR-conditional devices: Can undergo MRI with precautions
- Older legacy devices: Generally MRI-contraindicated (case-by-case)
- Programming required before and after MRI
- Specific absorption rate (SAR) limits apply
- Device must be interrogated post-MRI

**Device Infection:**
- Pocket infection: Local signs, may treat with antibiotics
- Lead infection/endocarditis: Requires complete system extraction
- Lead extraction: Laser or mechanical sheaths
- Risks: SVC tear, tamponade, mortality 0.2-1%
- Antibiotic therapy for 4-6 weeks
- Reimplantation on contralateral side after blood cultures negative

## Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators (ICDs)

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**What is an ICD?**

An ICD is a device that can save your life by stopping dangerous heart rhythms.

**You might need an ICD if:**
- You've survived a cardiac arrest
- You have a very weak heart (low ejection fraction)
- You have a heart condition that puts you at risk for sudden death

**How It Works:**
- Monitors your heart rhythm constantly
- If it detects a dangerous fast rhythm:
  - First, it may try to pace your heart back to normal
  - If that doesn't work, it delivers a shock to reset your heart
- Also works as a pacemaker if your heart beats too slowly

**What a Shock Feels Like:**
- Brief, uncomfortable jolt
- May knock you off your feet
- Report all shocks to your doctor

**When to Seek Immediate Help:**
- Multiple shocks in a row
- Shock with no warning
- Fainting before or after shock

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Types of ICDs:**

| Type | Description | Used For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Single-chamber ICD** | One lead in RV | VT/VF prevention, no pacing needs |
| **Dual-chamber ICD** | Leads in RA and RV | VT/VF + bradycardia, helps with rhythm discrimination |
| **CRT-D (Biventricular)** | Three leads | Heart failure with low EF and wide QRS |
| **Subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD)** | Lead under skin, not in heart | Patients without pacing needs, lead problems |

**ICD Therapies:**

| Therapy | What It Does | When Used |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Antitachycardia pacing (ATP) | Fast pacing to interrupt VT | First-line for most VT |
| Cardioversion | Low-energy shock | VT not terminated by ATP |
| Defibrillation | High-energy shock | VF or failed cardioversion |
| Bradycardia pacing | Regular pacing | Heart rate too slow |

**Primary vs. Secondary Prevention:**

| Type | Reason | Typical Criteria |
|------|--------|------------------|
| **Secondary** | Already survived cardiac arrest or sustained VT | Previous event |
| **Primary** | To prevent first event | EF ≤35% + NYHA II-III (ischemic or non-ischemic), EF ≤30% post-MI |

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**ICD Programming Considerations:**

**Detection:**
- VF zone: Typically >200-220 bpm, shock without delay
- VT zone: Typically 150-200 bpm, ATP first, then shock
- Slow VT zone: May monitor only or require extended detection

**Detection Enhancements:**
- SVT-VT discriminators (onset, stability, morphology, AV relationship)
- Prolonged detection times reduce inappropriate shocks
- MADIT-RIT: Long detection times reduced mortality

**Appropriate vs. Inappropriate Shocks:**

| Type | Cause | Prevention |
|------|-------|------------|
| Appropriate | True VT/VF | Optimal programming, medications, ablation |
| Inappropriate | AFib, SVT, T-wave oversensing, lead fracture | Discriminators, beta-blockers, lead management |

**Post-Shock Management:**
- Single appropriate shock: Clinic follow-up within 24-48 hours
- Multiple appropriate shocks: ER evaluation, consider VT storm
- Inappropriate shocks: Device interrogation, adjust programming
- VT storm (≥3 episodes in 24 hours): Hospitalize, sedation, ablation consideration

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD):**

**Advantages:**
- No transvenous leads (no lead failures, endocarditis reduced)
- Entire system extravascular
- No vascular access needed
- Preserves venous access for future therapies

**Disadvantages:**
- No antitachycardia pacing capability
- Cannot provide bradycardia pacing
- Cannot deliver CRT
- Larger device, left lateral implant
- Screening required to ensure adequate sensing

**Screening:**
- Manual or automated ECG screening in multiple positions
- Evaluates T-wave/QRS ratio to prevent T-wave oversensing
- Up to 10% of patients fail screening

**Patient Selection:**
- Young patients (long lead lifetime needed)
- Active patients (lead fracture risk)
- Hemodialysis patients (vascular access preservation)
- Previous lead infections
- Limited vascular access
- NOT for patients needing pacing or CRT

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Wearable Cardioverter-Defibrillator (WCD):**

**Indications:**
- Bridge therapy while awaiting ICD implant
- Post-MI waiting period (40 days)
- New cardiomyopathy diagnosis (may recover with GDMT)
- ICD explant for infection (bridge during antibiotic course)
- Awaiting heart transplant (if ICD not indicated)

**VEST Trial:**
- WCD vs. control post-MI with EF ≤35%
- No significant mortality reduction (high non-wear time)
- As-treated analysis showed benefit with adherent wear

**ICD Non-Benefit Scenarios:**
- Life expectancy <1 year
- Advanced heart failure (may benefit from LVAD/transplant instead)
- Incessant VT not suppressible
- Significant comorbidities (advanced dementia, end-stage renal disease, advanced malignancy)

**Deactivation Discussions:**
- Part of advance care planning
- Appropriate when death is expected and shocks would prolong dying
- Does NOT require cessation of pacing (if pacemaker-dependent)
- Can be done with magnet or programming
- Ethical consensus supports patient autonomy in this decision

## Catheter Ablation

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**What is Ablation?**

Ablation is a procedure that fixes abnormal heart rhythms by destroying tiny areas of heart tissue that cause the problem.

**How It's Done:**
- Thin tubes (catheters) are threaded through blood vessels to your heart
- The doctor maps the electrical signals in your heart
- Energy (heat or cold) destroys the abnormal tissue
- Usually takes 2-4 hours
- Often done with sedation, sometimes general anesthesia

**What to Expect:**
- May go home same day or stay overnight
- Mild chest discomfort for a few days
- Avoid strenuous activity for 1-2 weeks
- High success rates for many arrhythmias

**Conditions Commonly Treated:**
- SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) - very high success
- Atrial flutter - very high success
- Atrial fibrillation - moderate to high success
- Ventricular tachycardia - moderate success

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Success Rates by Arrhythmia:**

| Arrhythmia | Single Procedure Success | Complications |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------|
| AVNRT | >95% | <1% AV block |
| Typical atrial flutter | >95% | <1% |
| WPW/AVRT | >95% | <1% |
| Atrial tachycardia | 80-90% | <1% |
| Paroxysmal AFib | 70-80% | 2-4% |
| Persistent AFib | 50-70% | 2-4% |
| Idiopathic VT (RVOT) | >90% | <1% |
| Scar-related VT | 70-80% | 3-5% |

**Ablation Technologies:**

| Type | How It Works | Best For |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Radiofrequency (RF) | Heat destroys tissue | Most arrhythmias |
| Cryoablation | Cold (freezing) destroys tissue | Near AV node, pulmonary vein isolation |
| Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA) | Electrical fields disrupt cells | AFib (tissue-selective, safer near esophagus) |

**Before Your Ablation:**
- May stop blood thinners or antiarrhythmics beforehand (per your doctor)
- Nothing to eat or drink after midnight
- Blood tests, ECG, sometimes imaging
- Discuss all medications with your doctor

**After Your Ablation:**
- Groin or arm bandage - keep dry, watch for bleeding
- No driving for 24-48 hours
- No lifting >10 lbs for 1 week
- Some palpitations normal during healing (blanking period)
- Resume blood thinners as directed

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Atrial Fibrillation Ablation:**

**Core Strategy: Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI)**
- AF triggers originate from pulmonary veins
- Circumferential ablation lines electrically isolate all 4 veins
- Confirmation: Loss of PV potentials

**Additional Lesion Sets (Persistent AF):**
- Posterior wall isolation
- Mitral isthmus line
- Roof line
- Complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) - less popular now
- Non-PV trigger ablation

**Blanking Period:**
- First 3 months post-ablation
- Arrhythmia recurrence common during healing
- Antiarrhythmics often continued
- Anticoagulation continued regardless of rhythm
- Success determined after blanking period

**Complications:**

| Complication | Incidence | Prevention/Management |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Cardiac tamponade | 1-2% | Pericardiocentesis |
| Stroke/TIA | 0.5-1% | Anticoagulation, TEE |
| PV stenosis | <1% (with RF) | Avoid ablation inside PV |
| Atrio-esophageal fistula | <0.1% | Temperature monitoring, PPI, PFA |
| Phrenic nerve injury | 1-3% (cryoballoon) | Pacing during freeze |
| Vascular access | 1-2% | Ultrasound guidance |

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation:**

**Mapping Strategies:**
| Approach | When Used |
|----------|-----------|
| Activation mapping | During stable, hemodynamically tolerated VT |
| Entrainment mapping | Confirm re-entry circuit location |
| Substrate mapping | Scar-related VT in sinus rhythm |
| Pace mapping | Match QRS morphology to clinical VT |

**Ischemic vs. Non-Ischemic:**
| Feature | Ischemic VT | Non-Ischemic VT |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Scar location | Subendocardial, defined | Epicardial, mid-myocardial, patchy |
| Approach | Endocardial first | Often need epicardial |
| Mapping | More often mappable | May be unmappable |
| Success | 70-80% | 50-70% |

**Epicardial Ablation:**
- Percutaneous subxiphoid access to pericardial space
- Required in 30-50% of non-ischemic VT
- Complications: Pericarditis, coronary artery injury, phrenic nerve injury

**VT Substrate Ablation:**
- Target: Eliminate all abnormal electrograms in scar
- Late potentials, fractionated electrograms, low voltage areas
- Scar homogenization approach
- Reduces ICD shocks and VT recurrence

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Emerging Ablation Technologies:**

**Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA):**
- Electroporation: Irreversible cell membrane damage
- Tissue selectivity: Myocyte-specific (spares esophagus, nerves)
- Rapid lesion creation
- Early data: Similar efficacy to RF/cryo with improved safety
- FDA approved for AFib, expanding indications

**Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT):**
- External beam radiation for VT substrate
- ENCORE-VT, PREVENT VT studies
- For patients failing catheter ablation or not candidates
- Single-fraction 25 Gy to targeted substrate
- Emerging evidence, not widely available

**High-Power Short Duration (HPSD) RF:**
- 50-90W for 2-4 seconds
- Resistive heating predominates over conductive
- Shorter procedure times
- Potentially wider, shallower lesions (less collateral injury)

**Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy:**
- Non-invasive arrhythmia substrate modification
- Investigational

## Anticoagulation

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**What are Blood Thinners?**

Blood thinners (anticoagulants) are medications that help prevent blood clots. In atrial fibrillation and other conditions, they reduce your risk of stroke.

**Types of Blood Thinners:**

**Warfarin (Coumadin):**
- Been used for decades
- Requires regular blood tests (INR)
- Diet can affect it (vitamin K foods)
- Has an antidote for bleeding

**Newer Blood Thinners (DOACs):**
- Eliquis (apixaban)
- Xarelto (rivaroxaban)
- Pradaxa (dabigatran)
- Savaysa (edoxaban)
- No regular blood tests needed
- Fewer food and drug interactions
- Antidotes available

**Important Safety Tips:**
- Take exactly as prescribed
- Don't skip doses
- Tell all doctors and dentists you're on a blood thinner
- Watch for signs of bleeding
- Wear a medical ID bracelet

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Comparing Blood Thinners:**

| Feature | Warfarin | DOACs |
|---------|----------|-------|
| Monitoring | INR every 1-4 weeks | None routine |
| Dosing | Variable, adjusted by INR | Fixed doses |
| Food interactions | Vitamin K (greens) | Minimal |
| Drug interactions | Many | Fewer |
| Kidney clearance | No | Yes (dose adjustments) |
| Cost | Cheaper | More expensive |
| Reversal agent | Vitamin K, FFP, PCC | Specific antidotes |
| Half-life | Long (days) | Short (12-17 hours) |

**INR Goals for Warfarin:**
| Condition | Target INR |
|-----------|------------|
| Atrial fibrillation | 2.0-3.0 |
| Mechanical mitral valve | 2.5-3.5 |
| Mechanical aortic valve | 2.0-3.0 |

**Signs of Bleeding to Watch For:**
- Blood in urine (pink or red)
- Blood in stool (red or black/tarry)
- Bleeding gums
- Unusual bruising
- Prolonged bleeding from cuts
- Nosebleeds that won't stop
- Vomiting blood
- Severe headache, confusion, or weakness (possible brain bleed - EMERGENCY)

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**DOAC Dosing:**

| Drug | Standard Dose | Reduced Dose | Reduction Criteria |
|------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Apixaban** | 5 mg BID | 2.5 mg BID | Age ≥80 + weight ≤60 kg OR Cr ≥1.5 (need 2 of 3) |
| **Rivaroxaban** | 20 mg daily with food | 15 mg daily | CrCl 15-50 mL/min |
| **Dabigatran** | 150 mg BID | 75 mg BID | CrCl 15-30 mL/min |
| **Edoxaban** | 60 mg daily | 30 mg daily | CrCl 15-50, weight ≤60 kg, or P-gp inhibitor |

**Contraindications to DOACs:**
- Mechanical heart valve (use warfarin)
- Moderate-severe mitral stenosis (use warfarin)
- Severe kidney failure (CrCl <15)
- Pregnancy/breastfeeding
- Active significant bleeding

**Missed Doses:**
- **Once daily DOAC:** Take if <12 hours late; if >12 hours, skip and take next dose
- **Twice daily DOAC:** Take if <6 hours late; if >6 hours, skip and take next dose
- Never double up on doses

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Periprocedural Anticoagulation Management:**

**Procedure Bleeding Risk:**
| Low Risk (continue AC) | High Risk (hold AC) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Minor dental procedures | Major surgery |
| Cataract surgery | Spinal/epidural procedures |
| Minor skin procedures | Organ biopsy |
| Pacemaker implant (continued in some centers) | Joint replacement |

**DOAC Interruption:**
| Procedure Risk | CrCl ≥50 | CrCl 30-50 | CrCl 15-30 |
|----------------|----------|------------|------------|
| Low bleeding | 24 hr before | 36 hr before | 48 hr before |
| High bleeding | 48 hr before | 72 hr before | 96 hr before |

**Bridging:**
- Generally NOT recommended for DOACs (short half-life)
- For warfarin: Consider in high thromboembolic risk (mechanical valve, recent stroke)
- BRIDGE trial: No benefit to bridging in AF

**DOAC Reversal Agents:**

| Agent | Reverses | Mechanism | Dose |
|-------|----------|-----------|------|
| Idarucizumab (Praxbind) | Dabigatran | Antibody fragment | 5 g IV |
| Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) | Apixaban, rivaroxaban | Recombinant factor Xa decoy | 400-800 mg bolus + infusion |
| 4-factor PCC | All DOACs (partial) | Coagulation factors | 25-50 units/kg |

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Special Anticoagulation Scenarios:**

**AFib and Coronary Artery Disease:**
Post-PCI in AFib patients requires balancing stent thrombosis (antiplatelets) and stroke (anticoagulation) risks.

**AUGUSTUS, RE-DUAL PCI, ENTRUST-AF PCI Trials:**
- Dual therapy (OAC + P2Y12) preferred over triple therapy
- DOAC preferred over warfarin
- Aspirin adds bleeding without ischemic benefit in most

**Recommended Regimens:**
| Scenario | Duration | Regimen |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Low bleeding risk | 1-4 weeks | Triple therapy (OAC + DAPT) |
| | Then 12 months | Dual therapy (OAC + P2Y12) |
| | Then lifelong | OAC alone |
| High bleeding risk | Avoid or minimize | Triple therapy |
| | 6-12 months | Dual therapy |
| | Lifelong | OAC alone |

**Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion (LAAO):**
For patients with contraindication to long-term anticoagulation:
- WATCHMAN, AMULET devices
- Post-implant: DOAC or warfarin + aspirin for 45 days → DAPT for 6 months → aspirin alone
- Alternative: DAPT from implant (varies by protocol)
- Ongoing trials comparing directly to DOACs

**Anticoagulation in Special Populations:**
- Obesity (BMI >40 or >120 kg): DOACs appear effective; consider drug levels
- Extremes of renal function: Apixaban to CrCl 15; caution with other DOACs
- Liver disease: Avoid DOACs in Child-Pugh C; warfarin with caution
- Cancer-associated thrombosis: LMWH or DOACs (DOAC data expanding)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Arrhythmias range from benign to life-threatening** - Proper diagnosis is essential
2. **AFib increases stroke risk** - Blood thinners are critical for most patients
3. **Rate vs. rhythm control** - Both are valid strategies; individualize
4. **Ablation is curative for many arrhythmias** - Especially SVT and flutter
5. **Pacemakers treat slow rhythms** - ICDs prevent sudden death
6. **Take blood thinners exactly as prescribed** - Consistency is key
7. **Know when to seek emergency care** - Fainting, chest pain, multiple ICD shocks

## Questions to Ask Your Doctor

- What type of arrhythmia do I have?
- Do I need to be on a blood thinner? Which one?
- What are my options: medications, ablation, or devices?
- How successful is ablation for my arrhythmia?
- What are the risks and benefits of a pacemaker or ICD for me?
- What activities should I avoid?
- What symptoms should make me call you or go to the ER?
- How will my arrhythmia or device affect my daily life?
