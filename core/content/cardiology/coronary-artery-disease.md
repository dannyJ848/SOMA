# Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)

## Overview

Coronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease and a leading cause of death worldwide. Understanding CAD empowers patients to take control of their heart health through lifestyle changes and medical treatment.

## What is Coronary Artery Disease?

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)
Your heart is a muscle that needs blood to work. Coronary arteries are the blood vessels that feed your heart. In CAD, these arteries get clogged with fatty buildup, making it harder for blood to reach your heart muscle.

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)
Coronary artery disease develops when cholesterol and other substances build up in the walls of your heart's arteries. This buildup, called plaque, narrows the arteries over time (atherosclerosis). Less blood can flow through, which means your heart gets less oxygen and nutrients. This process usually takes decades to develop.

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)
CAD is caused by atherosclerosis—a progressive inflammatory disease affecting the coronary arteries. The process begins when the inner lining of arteries (endothelium) becomes damaged by factors like high blood pressure, smoking, or high cholesterol. LDL cholesterol penetrates the damaged endothelium, triggering an inflammatory response. White blood cells engulf the cholesterol, forming foam cells that accumulate as fatty streaks, which eventually develop into plaques.

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)
The pathophysiology of CAD involves complex interactions between lipid metabolism, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Oxidized LDL particles initiate the atherosclerotic cascade by activating endothelial cells to express adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1). Monocytes migrate into the intima and differentiate into macrophages, which become foam cells. Smooth muscle cells migrate from the media and produce extracellular matrix, forming a fibrous cap over the lipid core. Plaque stability depends on cap thickness and lipid core size.

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)
Contemporary understanding of CAD emphasizes the role of vulnerable plaque morphology rather than stenosis severity. Thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFA) with lipid-rich necrotic cores, spotty calcification, and positive remodeling pose the highest rupture risk. Plaque erosion, particularly in younger patients and women, represents an alternative mechanism to plaque rupture for acute coronary syndromes. Intravascular imaging modalities (IVUS, OCT) and non-invasive CT angiography with fractional flow reserve (FFR-CT) provide functional and anatomical assessment beyond traditional angiography.

## Risk Factors

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)
Things that increase your chance of getting CAD:
- **Cannot change:** Age, family history, being male
- **Can change:** Smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, not exercising, stress

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Non-Modifiable Risk Factors:**
- **Age:** Men over 45, women over 55
- **Sex:** Men develop CAD earlier; women catch up after menopause
- **Family history:** CAD in father/brother before age 55, or mother/sister before age 65
- **Ethnicity:** South Asians and African Americans have higher risk

**Modifiable Risk Factors:**
- **Smoking:** Damages artery walls and accelerates plaque buildup
- **High blood pressure:** Forces the heart to work harder
- **High LDL cholesterol:** The "bad" cholesterol that clogs arteries
- **Low HDL cholesterol:** The "good" cholesterol that protects arteries
- **Diabetes:** High blood sugar damages blood vessels
- **Obesity:** Especially abdominal obesity
- **Physical inactivity:** Weakens the heart and promotes other risk factors
- **Unhealthy diet:** High in saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium
- **Chronic stress:** Elevates blood pressure and promotes inflammation

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Traditional Risk Factors (Framingham):**
| Risk Factor | Target | Impact |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| LDL Cholesterol | <70-100 mg/dL for high risk | Each 40 mg/dL reduction = 20-25% CAD risk reduction |
| Blood Pressure | <130/80 mmHg | Each 20/10 mmHg increase doubles CAD risk |
| Smoking | Complete cessation | 2-4x increased CAD risk; reverses within 1-2 years of quitting |
| Diabetes | HbA1c <7% | 2-4x increased CAD risk; treated as CAD equivalent |
| HDL Cholesterol | >40 mg/dL (men), >50 mg/dL (women) | Inverse relationship with CAD risk |

**Emerging Risk Factors:**
- Lipoprotein(a) - genetically determined, independent risk factor
- High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) - inflammation marker
- Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score - subclinical atherosclerosis
- Metabolic syndrome - cluster of risk factors

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Risk Factor Interactions:**
Risk factors have multiplicative, not additive, effects. A person with two risk factors has more than double the risk of someone with one risk factor. The INTERHEART study identified nine modifiable risk factors accounting for over 90% of first MI risk worldwide:

1. Abnormal lipids (ApoB/ApoA1 ratio)
2. Smoking
3. Hypertension
4. Diabetes
5. Abdominal obesity
6. Psychosocial factors
7. Low fruit/vegetable intake
8. Low physical activity
9. Alcohol consumption

**Population Attributable Risk:**
- Smoking: 36%
- Abnormal lipids: 49%
- Hypertension: 18%
- Diabetes: 10%
- All nine factors combined: 90%

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Genetic Risk Stratification:**
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) incorporating hundreds of genetic variants improve risk prediction beyond traditional factors. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 160 loci associated with CAD, including 9p21, LPA, SORT1, and PCSK9. Mendelian randomization studies confirm causal roles for LDL-C, Lp(a), and blood pressure but question HDL-C as a therapeutic target.

**Inflammatory Hypothesis:**
The CANTOS trial demonstrated that targeting inflammation with canakinumab (IL-1β inhibitor) reduced cardiovascular events independent of lipid lowering, validating the inflammatory pathway. COLCOT and LoDoCo2 trials showed colchicine reduces events in post-MI and chronic CAD patients. Residual inflammatory risk (elevated hs-CRP despite statin therapy) predicts events independent of residual cholesterol risk.

## Angina (Chest Pain)

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)
Angina is chest pain or discomfort that happens when your heart doesn't get enough blood. It often feels like:
- Pressure or squeezing in your chest
- Pain that may spread to your shoulder, arm, neck, or jaw
- Shortness of breath

**It usually happens during:**
- Physical activity
- Emotional stress
- Cold weather
- After meals

**It usually goes away with:**
- Rest
- Nitroglycerin medicine

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Types of Angina:**

| Type | Pattern | Cause | Treatment |
|------|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Stable Angina** | Predictable; occurs with exertion | Fixed narrowing of arteries | Rest, nitroglycerin |
| **Unstable Angina** | New, worsening, or at rest | Plaque rupture, partial blockage | Emergency - call 911 |
| **Variant (Prinzmetal's)** | At rest, often at night | Coronary artery spasm | Calcium channel blockers |
| **Microvascular** | With exertion, prolonged | Small vessel disease | Beta-blockers, ranolazine |

**Classic Angina Description:**
- Location: Substernal (behind breastbone)
- Quality: Pressure, tightness, heaviness, burning
- Radiation: Left arm, jaw, neck, back
- Duration: 2-10 minutes
- Relief: Rest within 5 minutes, nitroglycerin within 1-5 minutes

**Using Nitroglycerin:**
1. Sit down before taking
2. Place one tablet under tongue
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. If pain continues, take second tablet
5. Wait 5 more minutes
6. If pain continues, take third tablet and call 911
7. Call 911 immediately if pain is severe or you have other symptoms

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Classification:**
- **Class I:** Angina only with strenuous exertion; ordinary activity (walking, climbing stairs) doesn't cause angina
- **Class II:** Slight limitation of ordinary activity; angina with walking more than 2 blocks or climbing more than 1 flight of stairs
- **Class III:** Marked limitation of ordinary activity; angina with walking 1-2 blocks or climbing 1 flight of stairs
- **Class IV:** Inability to perform any physical activity without angina; may occur at rest

**Angina Equivalents:**
Some patients, especially women, diabetics, and elderly, may present with atypical symptoms:
- Dyspnea (shortness of breath) on exertion
- Fatigue
- Nausea
- Epigastric discomfort
- Isolated arm or jaw pain

**Medication Management:**
- **Acute relief:** Sublingual nitroglycerin, nitroglycerin spray
- **Prevention:** Long-acting nitrates (isosorbide mononitrate), beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ranolazine
- **Nitrate tolerance:** Requires 10-12 hour nitrate-free interval daily

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Pathophysiology of Angina:**
Myocardial ischemia occurs when oxygen demand exceeds supply. The ischemic cascade follows a predictable sequence:
1. Perfusion abnormality (PET, SPECT)
2. Diastolic dysfunction (echo, MRI)
3. Systolic wall motion abnormality
4. ECG changes (ST depression)
5. Anginal symptoms

**Determinants of Myocardial Oxygen Supply and Demand:**

*Demand (↑ causes angina):*
- Heart rate
- Contractility
- Wall tension (determined by pressure × radius / wall thickness)

*Supply (↓ causes angina):*
- Coronary blood flow (stenosis severity, vasomotor tone)
- Oxygen-carrying capacity (anemia, hypoxia)
- Diastolic perfusion time

**Anti-anginal Mechanisms:**
| Drug Class | Preload | Afterload | Heart Rate | Contractility |
|------------|---------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Nitrates | ↓↓ | ↓ | ↔/↑ | ↔ |
| Beta-blockers | ↔ | ↔ | ↓↓ | ↓ |
| CCBs (dihydropyridine) | ↔ | ↓↓ | ↔/↑ | ↔ |
| CCBs (non-dihydropyridine) | ↔ | ↓ | ↓ | ↓ |
| Ranolazine | ↔ | ↔ | ↔ | ↔ (late Na+ current) |

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Coronary Flow Reserve and Microvascular Disease:**
Invasive FFR (fractional flow reserve) and iFR (instantaneous wave-free ratio) assess the hemodynamic significance of epicardial stenosis (≤0.80 and ≤0.89 cutoffs, respectively). However, up to 40% of patients with angina have non-obstructive CAD on angiography. ANOCA (angina with non-obstructive coronary arteries) encompasses:

1. **Microvascular dysfunction:** Impaired CFR (<2.0) with normal epicardial flow
2. **Vasospastic angina:** Acetylcholine provocation testing positive
3. **Combined phenotype:** Both microvascular and vasospastic components

The COVADIS criteria and CorMicA trial established diagnostic algorithms and treatment benefits for microvascular angina.

**Refractory Angina Treatment:**
- Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP)
- Coronary sinus reducer (Reducer device)
- Spinal cord stimulation
- Transmyocardial laser revascularization (historical)
- Investigational: CD34+ cell therapy, shock wave therapy

## Heart Attack Recognition

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**A heart attack is an emergency. Call 911 immediately if you have:**

- Chest pain or pressure lasting more than a few minutes
- Pain spreading to your shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw
- Shortness of breath
- Breaking out in a cold sweat
- Nausea or vomiting
- Feeling lightheaded

**Remember: Time is muscle!** The faster you get treatment, the more heart muscle you save.

**What to do:**
1. Call 911 immediately
2. Chew an aspirin (325 mg or 4 baby aspirins) if not allergic
3. Sit or lie down
4. Try to stay calm
5. Do not drive yourself to the hospital

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Warning Signs of Heart Attack:**

| Common Symptoms | Less Common Symptoms |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Chest pain/pressure/tightness | Fatigue |
| Pain in arm, neck, jaw, back | Indigestion |
| Shortness of breath | Nausea/vomiting |
| Cold sweat | Dizziness |
| Anxiety ("sense of doom") | Sleep disturbances (days before) |

**Symptoms May Be Different in Women:**
- More likely to have shortness of breath, nausea, back or jaw pain
- May have fatigue, sleep problems, or anxiety days before
- Chest pain may be absent or less prominent
- Often describe as "not feeling right"

**Symptoms May Be Different in Diabetics:**
- May have "silent" heart attacks with minimal symptoms
- Shortness of breath may be only symptom
- Fatigue, weakness, or confusion

**Act F.A.S.T.:**
- **F**ace: Facial pain or jaw pain
- **A**rm: Arm pain, especially left
- **S**queeze: Chest pressure or squeezing
- **T**ime: Call 911 immediately

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Types of Acute Coronary Syndrome:**

| Type | ECG Finding | Troponin | Mechanism |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **STEMI** | ST elevation | Elevated | Complete occlusion |
| **NSTEMI** | ST depression, T-wave inversion, or normal | Elevated | Partial occlusion or complete with collaterals |
| **Unstable Angina** | ST depression, T-wave inversion, or normal | Normal | Partial occlusion |

**Time-Critical Treatment:**
- **Door-to-balloon time goal:** <90 minutes for primary PCI
- **Door-to-needle time goal:** <30 minutes for fibrinolysis (if PCI unavailable)
- **First medical contact to device:** <120 minutes (including transfer)

**What Happens at the Hospital:**
1. ECG within 10 minutes of arrival
2. Blood tests (troponin, BNP, chemistry)
3. Aspirin, heparin, P2Y12 inhibitor
4. Cardiac catheterization for STEMI (emergent) or NSTEMI (within 24-72 hours based on risk)
5. Stent placement if indicated
6. Monitoring in cardiac care unit

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Pathophysiology of MI:**
Acute MI results from sudden reduction in coronary blood flow, usually due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion with superimposed thrombosis. The wavefront phenomenon of necrosis progresses from endocardium to epicardium over 3-6 hours, forming the rationale for early reperfusion.

**Universal Definition of MI (Fourth):**
Type 1: Atherothrombotic (plaque rupture/erosion)
Type 2: Supply-demand mismatch (secondary to other condition)
Type 3: MI resulting in death before biomarkers obtained
Type 4a: PCI-related MI
Type 4b: Stent thrombosis
Type 4c: Restenosis
Type 5: CABG-related MI

**Risk Stratification:**
GRACE score predicts in-hospital and 6-month mortality:
- Age
- Heart rate
- Systolic blood pressure
- Creatinine
- Killip class
- Cardiac arrest at presentation
- ST deviation
- Elevated cardiac biomarkers

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Reperfusion Strategies:**
Primary PCI remains the gold standard for STEMI when achievable within guideline-recommended times. The STREAM trial demonstrated fibrinolysis with routine early angiography as an alternative when PCI delays are anticipated. Pharmacoinvasive strategy involves fibrinolysis followed by angiography within 3-24 hours.

**Adjunctive Pharmacotherapy:**
- Antiplatelets: Aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor preferred over clopidogrel in ACS)
- Anticoagulation: UFH, enoxaparin, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux depending on strategy
- GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors: Reserved for bail-out or high-risk situations
- Complete revascularization: COMPLETE trial supports staged PCI of non-culprit lesions

**Myocardial Salvage and Infarct Size:**
Cardiac MRI with late gadolinium enhancement quantifies infarct size and microvascular obstruction (no-reflow). Area-at-risk can be delineated by T2-weighted imaging. Myocardial salvage index = (area at risk - infarct size) / area at risk. Novel cardioprotective strategies targeting reperfusion injury (conditioning, mitochondrial protection) remain investigational.

## Stents vs Bypass Surgery

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

When your heart arteries are blocked, there are two main ways to restore blood flow:

**Stents (PCI - Percutaneous Coronary Intervention):**
- A small tube placed inside the artery to hold it open
- Done through a small puncture in your wrist or groin
- Usually go home next day
- Need to take blood thinners afterward

**Bypass Surgery (CABG - Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting):**
- Uses blood vessels from your leg or chest to go around blockages
- Open heart surgery
- Longer recovery (6-12 weeks)
- Better for multiple blockages or diabetes

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Comparing Stents and Bypass:**

| Factor | Stents (PCI) | Bypass (CABG) |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Procedure | Catheter through wrist/groin | Open chest surgery |
| Hospital stay | 1-2 days | 5-7 days |
| Recovery | Days to 1 week | 6-12 weeks |
| Risk of stroke | Lower short-term | Higher short-term |
| Need for repeat procedure | Higher (10-20%) | Lower (5%) |
| Durability | May need intervention within 5 years | Grafts last 10-20+ years |
| Best for | 1-2 vessel disease, non-diabetics | 3-vessel or left main disease, diabetics |

**When Stents Are Preferred:**
- Single or double vessel disease
- Acute heart attack (STEMI)
- Not a good surgical candidate
- Preference for less invasive approach

**When Bypass Is Preferred:**
- Triple vessel disease
- Left main coronary artery disease
- Diabetes with multi-vessel disease
- Complex blockages not suitable for stents
- Reduced heart function

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Drug-Eluting Stents (DES):**
Modern stents are coated with medications that prevent re-narrowing (restenosis):
- Everolimus, zotarolimus, sirolimus-eluting stents
- Restenosis rates: 5-10% at 1 year (vs. 20-30% with bare metal stents)
- Require dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT): aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor
- DAPT duration: Minimum 6 months (stable CAD) to 12 months (ACS)

**CABG Grafts:**
| Graft Type | Source | 10-Year Patency |
|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA) | Chest wall | >90% |
| Right Internal Mammary Artery (RIMA) | Chest wall | 80-90% |
| Radial Artery | Forearm | 80-90% |
| Saphenous Vein | Leg | 50-60% |

**LIMA to LAD** is the gold standard and provides survival benefit.

**Surgical Approaches:**
- Traditional: Median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass
- Off-pump CABG: No heart-lung machine
- Minimally invasive: Smaller incisions, robotic assistance

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Key Trials Comparing PCI and CABG:**

| Trial | Population | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| **SYNTAX** | 3-vessel/left main | CABG superior for complex disease (high SYNTAX score) |
| **FREEDOM** | Diabetes + multi-vessel | CABG reduced death and MI at 5 years |
| **EXCEL** | Left main (low-intermediate complexity) | PCI non-inferior at 3 years; controversy at 5 years |
| **NOBLE** | Left main | CABG superior for MACCE at 5 years |
| **ISCHEMIA** | Stable CAD + moderate-severe ischemia | No difference between invasive and conservative strategy for death/MI |

**SYNTAX Score:**
Anatomical scoring system (0-100+) predicting PCI outcomes:
- Low (0-22): PCI reasonable
- Intermediate (23-32): Heart team discussion
- High (>32): CABG preferred

**Hybrid Revascularization:**
Combines LIMA-LAD graft with PCI to non-LAD territories. May offer benefits of arterial grafting with reduced surgical morbidity. HYBRID pilot trials show feasibility; larger trials ongoing.

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Contemporary Considerations:**

**Residual SYNTAX Score (rSS):**
Post-PCI anatomical burden predicts outcomes. Complete revascularization (rSS = 0) associated with better outcomes than incomplete revascularization.

**Functional Complete Revascularization:**
Physiology-guided PCI (FFR/iFR) achieves functional completeness by treating only hemodynamically significant lesions. FAME 3 trial: FFR-guided PCI approached CABG outcomes in 3-vessel disease.

**Long-term Antithrombotic Strategies Post-PCI:**
- Standard DAPT (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor)
- De-escalation to P2Y12 monotherapy (TWILIGHT, TICO)
- Extended DAPT beyond 12 months in high-risk patients
- Dual pathway inhibition with rivaroxaban (COMPASS)

**Surgical Innovation:**
- Total arterial revascularization (bilateral IMA + radial)
- Anaortic/no-touch techniques reduce stroke
- Endoscopic vein harvesting improves graft patency
- MICS CABG (minimally invasive cardiac surgery)

| High-intensity statin | Lower LDL cholesterol | LDL < 70 mg/dL |
| Beta-blocker | Protect heart, lower BP | Heart rate 60-70 bpm |
| ACE inhibitor or ARB | Protect heart, lower BP | BP < 130/80 mmHg |

**Lifestyle Modification Goals:**

| Factor | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Smoking | Complete cessation |
| Blood pressure | < 130/80 mmHg |
| LDL cholesterol | < 70 mg/dL (or 50% reduction) |
| Diabetes control | HbA1c < 7% |
| Weight | BMI 18.5-25 kg/m² |

| Diet | Mediterranean or DASH pattern |

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Cardiac Rehabilitation:**
Comprehensive program including:
1. **Supervised exercise:** 3x/week for 12 weeks, then maintenance
2. **Education:** Risk factor modification, medication adherence
3. **Nutritional counseling:** Heart-healthy diet, weight management
4. **Psychological support:** Depression screening, stress management
5. **Smoking cessation:** Counseling, pharmacotherapy

Benefits of cardiac rehab:
- 20-30% reduction in mortality
- Improved quality of life
- Reduced hospital readmissions
- Better medication adherence

**Lipid Management Intensity:**

| Risk Category | Statin Intensity | Additional Therapy |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Clinical ASCVD | High-intensity | Add ezetimibe if LDL ≥70 |
| Very high risk ASCVD | High-intensity | Add ezetimibe ± PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL ≥70 |
| LDL ≥190 mg/dL | High-intensity | Target 50% reduction + LDL <70 |
| Diabetes + ASCVD | High-intensity | Add ezetimibe if LDL ≥70 |

High-intensity statins: Atorvastatin 40-80 mg, Rosuvastatin 20-40 mg

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Secondary Prevention Pharmacotherapy Evidence:**

| Intervention | Relative Risk Reduction | Number Needed to Treat (5 years) |
|--------------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Aspirin | 20-25% (MACE) | 50-100 |
| P2Y12 inhibitor (added to aspirin) | 20% (MACE) | 50 |
| High-intensity statin | 30-35% (MACE) | 30 |
| ACE inhibitor (with LV dysfunction) | 20% (death) | 25 |
| Beta-blocker (post-MI) | 20% (death) | 40 |
| PCSK9 inhibitor (added to statin) | 15% (MACE) | 65 |

**Newer Agents:**
- **Icosapent ethyl (Vascepa):** 25% MACE reduction in REDUCE-IT (elevated TG on statin)
- **Low-dose rivaroxaban + aspirin:** 24% MACE reduction in COMPASS (stable ASCVD)
- **SGLT2 inhibitors:** Benefits extend beyond diabetes to heart failure and CKD
- **Colchicine:** 23-31% MACE reduction in COLCOT/LoDoCo2

**Residual Risk Targets:**
- Residual cholesterol risk: Lp(a) reduction trials ongoing
- Residual inflammatory risk: hs-CRP as treatment target
- Residual thrombotic risk: Dual pathway inhibition consideration

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Personalized Secondary Prevention:**

**Genetic Considerations:**
- SLCO1B1 genotyping for statin myopathy risk
- CYP2C19 loss-of-function for clopidogrel response
- LPA for Lp(a)-targeted therapy (when available)

**Precision Antithrombotic Therapy:**
Platelet function testing (VerifyNow) and genotyping can identify clopidogrel non-responders. However, routine testing not recommended as switching to prasugrel/ticagrelor based on testing hasn't shown outcome benefit in trials. Consider in specific situations (stent thrombosis, high-risk).

**Long-term Antiplatelet Strategy:**
| Duration | Evidence | Consideration |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| DAPT 1-3 months | STOPDAPT-2, MASTER DAPT | High bleeding risk |
| DAPT 6 months | Standard after DES | Low-intermediate risk |
| DAPT 12 months | After ACS | Moderate risk |
| Extended DAPT (>12 mo) | DAPT trial | High ischemic, low bleeding risk |
| P2Y12 monotherapy | TWILIGHT, TICO | Alternative to extended DAPT |

**Imaging for Risk Stratification:**
- Coronary CTA: Plaque burden and composition
- Cardiac MRI: Infarct size, viability
- CAC progression: Marker of atherosclerosis activity
