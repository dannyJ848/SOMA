# Heart Failure

## Overview

Heart failure is a condition where your heart can't pump blood as well as it should. With proper treatment and self-care, many people with heart failure live active, fulfilling lives. Understanding your condition and following your treatment plan are the keys to staying well.

---

## Types of Heart Failure

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**Your heart has two main pumping problems that can occur:**

**Systolic Heart Failure (HFrEF - Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction):**
- Your heart muscle is weak
- It can't squeeze hard enough to pump blood out
- The heart's pumping ability is reduced (less than 40%)

**Diastolic Heart Failure (HFpEF - Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction):**
- Your heart muscle is stiff
- It can't relax enough to fill with blood
- The heart's pumping ability looks normal (50% or more), but it's still not working right

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Heart Failure Classifications:**

| Type | Ejection Fraction | Heart Muscle Problem | Common Causes |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **HFrEF** (Reduced EF) | ≤40% | Weak, dilated | Heart attack, cardiomyopathy |
| **HFmrEF** (Mildly Reduced EF) | 41-49% | Intermediate | Various causes |
| **HFpEF** (Preserved EF) | ≥50% | Stiff, thick | High blood pressure, diabetes, aging |

**Understanding Ejection Fraction (EF):**
- EF measures what percentage of blood leaves your heart with each beat
- Normal EF: 55-70%
- Think of it like a water balloon: in HFrEF, the balloon is stretched and weak; in HFpEF, the balloon is stiff and can't expand

**Other Classifications:**
- **Left-sided heart failure:** Affects pumping to the body (causes lung congestion)
- **Right-sided heart failure:** Affects pumping to the lungs (causes leg swelling)
- **Biventricular failure:** Both sides affected

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**HFrEF vs HFpEF - Pathophysiology:**

**HFrEF (Systolic Dysfunction):**
- Impaired contractility (reduced inotropy)
- Eccentric remodeling: Chamber dilation, wall thinning
- Neurohormonal activation: ↑Sympathetic, ↑RAAS, ↑Natriuretic peptides
- Progressive ventricular dilation and dysfunction
- Responds well to GDMT (guideline-directed medical therapy)

**HFpEF (Diastolic Dysfunction):**
- Impaired relaxation and increased stiffness
- Concentric remodeling: Wall thickening, normal or small cavity
- Multiple comorbidities: Obesity, hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, CKD
- Systemic pro-inflammatory state
- Limited proven therapies (until recent SGLT2i trials)

**Hemodynamic Profiles:**
| Parameter | HFrEF | HFpEF |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| LV end-diastolic pressure | ↑ | ↑↑ |
| LV end-diastolic volume | ↑↑ | Normal/↓ |
| Cardiac output | ↓ | Normal at rest, ↓ with exercise |
| Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure | ↑ | ↑ (especially with exercise) |

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Heart Failure Phenotyping:**

**HFrEF Etiologies:**
1. **Ischemic cardiomyopathy** (most common in developed countries)
   - Prior MI with scar
   - Hibernating myocardium (viable but dysfunctional)
2. **Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy**
   - Idiopathic (many likely genetic)
   - Familial/genetic (TTN, LMNA, MYH7)
   - Viral/post-myocarditis
   - Toxins (alcohol, chemotherapy - anthracyclines, trastuzumab)
   - Peripartum
   - Tachycardia-mediated
3. **Valvular heart disease**
4. **Hypertensive heart disease** (can cause HFrEF or HFpEF)

**HFpEF Phenotypes (HFA-PEFF Algorithm):**
- Aging phenotype: Chronotropic incompetence, arterial stiffness
- Obesity phenotype: Epicardial fat, systemic inflammation
- Pulmonary hypertension phenotype: Right heart failure predominant
- Atrial fibrillation phenotype: Atrial myopathy, LA dysfunction
- Coronary microvascular dysfunction phenotype
- Cardiometabolic/diabetic phenotype

**HFpEF Diagnosis (H2FPEF Score):**
- Heavy (BMI >30): 2 points
- Hypertension: 1 point
- Atrial Fibrillation: 3 points
- Pulmonary hypertension (echo PASP >35): 1 point
- Elder (age >60): 1 point
- Filling pressure (E/e' >9): 1 point

Score ≥6: High probability of HFpEF

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Molecular Mechanisms and Emerging Classifications:**

**HFrEF Molecular Pathways:**
- Calcium handling abnormalities (SERCA2a dysfunction, RyR2 leak)
- Sarcomeric dysfunction (titin truncation in TTN mutations)
- Mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic remodeling
- Myocyte apoptosis and fibrosis
- MicroRNA dysregulation (miR-1, miR-133, miR-21)

**HFpEF as a Systemic Syndrome:**
The comorbidity-inflammation paradigm suggests HFpEF results from:
1. Systemic pro-inflammatory state driven by comorbidities
2. Coronary microvascular endothelial inflammation
3. Reduced NO bioavailability → ↓cGMP → ↓PKG activity
4. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and stiffness (hypophosphorylated titin)
5. Interstitial fibrosis

**Emerging Classifications:**
- Universal definition of HF (2021): Structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality with symptoms/signs, elevated natriuretic peptides, and/or objective evidence of congestion
- HF with improved EF (HFimpEF): Previously reduced EF, now >40%
- HF phenomapping: Machine learning-derived clusters for personalized therapy

## Symptoms of Heart Failure

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**Common symptoms to watch for:**

**Shortness of Breath:**
- When walking or exercising
- When lying flat (need to prop up with pillows)
- Waking up at night gasping for air

**Swelling:**
- Feet, ankles, and legs
- Belly becoming bigger

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Symptom Classification (NYHA Functional Class):**

| Class | Activity Level | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **I** | No limitation | Ordinary activity doesn't cause symptoms |
| **II** | Slight limitation | Comfortable at rest; ordinary activity causes symptoms |
| **III** | Marked limitation | Comfortable at rest; less than ordinary activity causes symptoms |
| **IV** | Severe limitation | Symptoms at rest; any activity worsens symptoms |

**Symptoms Explained:**

| Symptom | Medical Term | Cause |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Shortness of breath with activity | Dyspnea on exertion | Fluid backing up into lungs |
| Shortness of breath lying down | Orthopnea | Redistribution of fluid when supine |
| Waking up gasping | Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND) | Fluid accumulation during sleep |
| Leg swelling | Peripheral edema | Right heart backup, fluid retention |
| Abdominal swelling | Ascites | Liver congestion, low albumin |
| Fatigue | - | Low cardiac output |
| Cough | Cardiac cough | Pulmonary congestion |
| Confusion | Cardiogenic encephalopathy | Poor brain perfusion |

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Physical Examination Findings:**

**Signs of Congestion (Volume Overload):**
- Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP)
- Pulmonary crackles (rales)
- S3 gallop (third heart sound)
- Peripheral edema (pitting)
- Hepatomegaly, hepatojugular reflux
- Ascites
- Weight gain

**Signs of Low Output (Poor Perfusion):**
- Cool extremities
- Weak pulse (pulsus alternans)
- Narrow pulse pressure
- Low blood pressure
- Confusion, drowsiness
- Decreased urine output

**Hemodynamic Profiles (Forrester Classification):**
| Profile | Congestion | Perfusion | Treatment |
|---------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Warm & Dry | No | Adequate | Optimize GDMT |
| Warm & Wet | Yes | Adequate | Diuretics |
| Cold & Dry | No | Poor | Fluids, consider inotropes |
| Cold & Wet | Yes | Poor | Diuretics + inotropes |

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Symptom Pathophysiology:**

**Dyspnea:**
- Elevated left-sided filling pressures → pulmonary venous congestion
- Activation of J receptors in pulmonary interstitium
- Respiratory muscle fatigue (reduced perfusion)
- Exercise ventilatory inefficiency (VE/VCO2 slope elevation)

**Orthopnea and PND:**
- Supine position → redistribution of ~500cc from lower extremities
- Increased venous return → ↑preload → ↑pulmonary congestion
- PND: Takes 1-2 hours supine for sufficient fluid redistribution
- Cheyne-Stokes respiration: Central sleep apnea variant in HF

**Edema Formation:**
- ↑Hydrostatic pressure (venous congestion)
- ↓Oncotic pressure (hypoalbuminemia from liver congestion/cachexia)
- ↑Capillary permeability (endothelial dysfunction)
- Impaired lymphatic drainage
- Sodium/water retention (RAAS activation, renal hypoperfusion)

**Fatigue and Exercise Intolerance:**
- Reduced cardiac output reserve
- Skeletal muscle abnormalities (fiber type shift, mitochondrial dysfunction)
- Impaired oxygen extraction
- Chronotropic incompetence

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Biomarker Correlation with Symptoms:**

**Natriuretic Peptides:**
- BNP/NT-proBNP correlate with wall stress and filling pressures
- Thresholds: BNP <100 or NT-proBNP <300 pg/mL excludes acute HF
- Chronic HF: Higher thresholds appropriate
- Confounders: Obesity (↓), renal dysfunction (↑), AF (↑)

**High-Sensitivity Troponin:**
- Chronically elevated in HF (ongoing myocyte injury)
- Predicts outcomes; rising levels indicate worsening status

**Other Biomarkers:**
- sST2: Myocardial fibrosis/remodeling
- Galectin-3: Fibrosis
- GDF-15: Inflammation, cachexia
- Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA-125): Congestion marker

**Invasive Hemodynamics:**
CardioMEMS (PA pressure monitoring) in CHAMPION trial reduced HF hospitalizations by 28%. Filling pressure-guided management superior to symptom-based management.

**Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET):**
- Peak VO2: <14 mL/kg/min indicates poor prognosis
- VE/VCO2 slope: >35 associated with poor outcomes
- Exercise oscillatory ventilation: Marker of severe HF
- Useful for transplant/LVAD listing decisions

## Stages of Heart Failure

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

Heart failure is a progressive condition. There are four stages:

**Stage A - At Risk:**
- No heart failure yet
- Have risk factors (high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity)
- Goal: Prevent heart failure from developing

**Stage B - Pre-Heart Failure:**
- Heart shows changes but no symptoms
- May have had a heart attack or have a weak heart
- Goal: Prevent symptoms from developing

**Stage C - Symptomatic Heart Failure:**
- Have heart failure with symptoms
- Taking medications for heart failure
- Goal: Control symptoms, prevent hospitalization

**Stage D - Advanced Heart Failure:**
- Symptoms despite maximum treatment
- May need specialized treatments
- Goal: Improve quality of life, consider advanced options

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**ACC/AHA Stages of Heart Failure:**

| Stage | Description | Examples | Treatment Focus |
|-------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **A** | At risk, no structural disease | HTN, DM, CAD, family history | Risk factor modification |
| **B** | Structural disease, no symptoms | Previous MI, LVH, low EF, valve disease | GDMT to prevent progression |
| **C** | Structural disease with current or prior symptoms | Known HF with dyspnea, edema, fatigue | Full GDMT, manage symptoms |
| **D** | Refractory symptoms requiring specialized intervention | HF despite optimal therapy | Advanced therapies (transplant, LVAD, palliative care) |

**Important Points:**
- Stages are progressive (Stage A → B → C → D)
- You can improve within a stage but generally don't go back a stage
- NYHA class (I-IV) can fluctuate within Stage C
- Stage D does NOT mean end of life - many options available

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Stage-Specific Interventions:**

| 2 | Progressive decline on inotropes | Days |
| 3 | Stable but inotrope-dependent | Weeks |
| 4 | Resting symptoms, frequent admissions | Weeks to months |
| 5 | Exertion intolerant | Variable |
| 6 | Exertion limited | Variable |
| 7 | Advanced NYHA Class III | Variable |

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Advanced HF Trajectory and Decision-Making:**

**Prognostic Models:**
- Seattle Heart Failure Model: Comprehensive predictors, estimates 1-5 year survival
- MAGGIC score: Meta-analysis derived, 1-3 year mortality
- SHFM and HFSS for transplant/LVAD candidacy
- Cardiopulmonary exercise testing: Peak VO2, VE/VCO2

**Bridge to Decision Paradigm:**
- Short-term MCS (Impella, ECMO) for acute stabilization
- Durable LVAD as bridge to transplant, bridge to candidacy, or destination therapy
- Ongoing reassessment of candidacy and goals

**Heart Transplant Evaluation:**
- Age typically <70 years
- No irreversible pulmonary hypertension (TPG <15, PVR <5 Wood units)
- No active malignancy
- No active infection
- Adequate social support and compliance history
- BMI <35 kg/m²
- No significant irreversible renal/hepatic dysfunction

**LVAD Considerations:**
- Survival now approaching transplant in select patients
- MOMENTUM 3: HeartMate 3 with low pump thrombosis rates
- Ongoing complications: Bleeding (GI), stroke, device infection, RV failure
- Quality of life significantly improved
- Increasing use as destination therapy in non-transplant candidates

## Medications for Heart Failure

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**There are several important medications for heart failure. Each one helps in a different way:**

**ACE Inhibitors or ARBs:**
- Names: Lisinopril, enalapril, losartan, valsartan
- Help your heart pump better
- Lower blood pressure
- Reduce strain on your heart

**Beta-Blockers:**
- Names: Carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, bisoprolol
- Slow your heart rate
- Help your heart pump stronger over time
- Protect your heart

**ARNI (Entresto):**
- Combination medicine
- Works better than ACE inhibitors for many people
- Helps your heart recover

**SGLT2 Inhibitors:**
- Names: Dapagliflozin, empagliflozin
- Originally for diabetes but helps all HF patients
- Reduces hospitalizations

**Diuretics (Water Pills):**
- Names: Furosemide (Lasix), torsemide, bumetanide
- Remove extra fluid
- Reduce swelling
- Make breathing easier

**Aldosterone Blockers:**
- Names: Spironolactone, eplerenone
- Protect your heart
- Help remove fluid gently

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Why Each Medication Matters:**

| Medication Class | How It Works | Benefits | Common Side Effects |
|-----------------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| **ACE Inhibitor** | Blocks hormone (angiotensin) that narrows blood vessels | ↓ death, ↓ hospitalization, reverse remodeling | Cough, dizziness, high potassium |
| **ARB** | Similar to ACE inhibitor, different mechanism | Same benefits, no cough | Dizziness, high potassium |
| **ARNI (sacubitril/valsartan)** | ARB + enhances beneficial hormones | Better than ACE inhibitors | Low BP, angioedema (rare) |
| **Beta-blocker** | Slows heart, blocks stress hormones | ↓ death, ↑ EF over time | Fatigue, slow pulse, dizziness |
| **MRA (spironolactone/eplerenone)** | Blocks aldosterone hormone | ↓ death, ↓ hospitalization | High potassium, gynecomastia (spironolactone) |
| **SGLT2 Inhibitor** | Originally for diabetes, multiple HF benefits | ↓ death, ↓ hospitalization | Genital infections, dehydration |
| **Loop Diuretic** | Removes sodium and water | Relieves congestion | Dehydration, electrolyte issues |

**The Four Pillars of HFrEF Therapy:**
1. ARNI (or ACE inhibitor/ARB)
2. Beta-blocker
3. MRA
4. SGLT2 inhibitor

All four should be started and uptitrated as tolerated.

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) Targets:**

| Drug | Starting Dose | Target Dose |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Sacubitril/valsartan** | 24/26 mg BID | 97/103 mg BID |
| **Enalapril** | 2.5 mg BID | 10-20 mg BID |
| **Lisinopril** | 2.5-5 mg daily | 20-40 mg daily |
| **Carvedilol** | 3.125 mg BID | 25-50 mg BID |
| **Metoprolol succinate** | 12.5-25 mg daily | 200 mg daily |
| **Bisoprolol** | 1.25 mg daily | 10 mg daily |
| **Spironolactone** | 12.5-25 mg daily | 25-50 mg daily |
| **Eplerenone** | 25 mg daily | 50 mg daily |
| **Dapagliflozin** | 10 mg daily | 10 mg daily |
| **Empagliflozin** | 10 mg daily | 10 mg daily |

**Uptitration Principles:**
- Double doses every 2 weeks if tolerated
- Check blood pressure, heart rate, kidney function, potassium
- Some patients won't tolerate target doses - any dose better than none
- Don't stop medications for mild symptoms - they take weeks to show benefit

**Diuretic Management:**
- Use the lowest dose needed to maintain dry weight
- Adjust based on daily weights
- Loop diuretics: Furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide
- Conversion: Furosemide 40 mg = Bumetanide 1 mg = Torsemide 20 mg
- Add thiazide (metolazone) for diuretic resistance

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Evidence Behind GDMT:**

| Trial | Drug | Mortality Reduction |
|-------|------|---------------------|
| CONSENSUS/SOLVD | Enalapril | 16-27% |
| COPERNICUS | Carvedilol | 35% |
| MERIT-HF | Metoprolol XL | 34% |
| RALES | Spironolactone | 30% |
| EMPHASIS-HF | Eplerenone | 24% |
| PARADIGM-HF | Sacubitril/valsartan | 20% (vs. enalapril) |
| DAPA-HF | Dapagliflozin | 18% |
| EMPEROR-Reduced | Empagliflozin | 17% (trending) |

**Rapid Sequence Initiation:**
Traditional: Sequential initiation over months
Contemporary: All four drug classes can be initiated rapidly (STRONG-HF trial)
- Start low doses of all four pillars within 1-2 weeks
- Intensive follow-up with uptitration
- Better outcomes than slow sequential approach

**Additional Medications (Select Patients):**

| Drug | Indication | Evidence |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Hydralazine/Isosorbide dinitrate** | ACE/ARB/ARNI intolerant, or add-on for Black patients | A-HeFT |
| **Ivabradine** | EF ≤35%, HR ≥70 on max beta-blocker, sinus rhythm | SHIFT |
| **Digoxin** | Symptom control, rate control in AF | DIG trial (neutral mortality) |
| **Vericiguat** | Recent worsening HF | VICTORIA |

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Optimizing GDMT in Complex Scenarios:**

**Hypotension Limiting Uptitration:**
- Prioritize: Beta-blocker and ARNI have strongest mortality benefit
- Consider reducing diuretic if euvolemic
- Time medications to minimize additive effects
- Split doses
- Rule out overdiuresis

**Renal Dysfunction:**
- Up to 30% creatinine rise acceptable when starting ACE/ARB/ARNI
- SGLT2 inhibitors: Initial eGFR dip expected, protective long-term
- MRA: Avoid if eGFR <30, K+ >5.5
- True cardiorenal syndrome may require inotropes or ultrafiltration

**Hyperkalemia:**
- Target K+ <5.5 mEq/L
- Potassium binders (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) enable RAAS inhibitor use
- Reduce dietary potassium
- Check drug interactions

**HFpEF-Specific Therapy:**
- SGLT2 inhibitors: EMPEROR-Preserved, DELIVER showed benefit
- Diuretics for congestion
- Treat underlying conditions (AF, HTN, CAD, obesity)
- GLP-1 agonists for obesity/diabetes phenotype (STEP-HFpEF)
- Finerenone (non-steroidal MRA) in diabetic kidney disease

**Emerging Therapies:**
- Omecamtiv mecarbil: Cardiac myosin activator (GALACTIC-HF, modest benefit)
- Gene therapy for genetic cardiomyopathies
- Antisense therapies for ATTR amyloidosis

## Daily Weight Monitoring

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**Weighing yourself every day is one of the most important things you can do.**

**How to weigh yourself:**
- Same time every day (morning is best)
- After going to the bathroom
- Before eating or drinking
- Wearing similar clothing
- Same scale, same spot

**Write down your weight every day!**

**When to call your doctor:**
- Weight gain of 3 pounds in one day
- Weight gain of 5 pounds in one week
- Your doctor may give you different numbers to watch for

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Why Daily Weights Matter:**

Fluid buildup often happens before you notice symptoms. By catching weight gain early, you can prevent a hospitalization.

**Understanding Weight Fluctuations:**

| Weight Change | Possible Cause | Action |
|---------------|----------------|--------|
| 1-2 lbs in a day | Normal variation | Continue monitoring |
| 3+ lbs in a day | Fluid retention | Call your doctor/clinic |
| 5+ lbs in a week | Significant fluid gain | Call your doctor/clinic |
| Gradual loss over weeks | Improved status OR cardiac cachexia | Discuss with doctor |
| Rapid loss | Overdiuresis | Reduce diuretics, call if symptoms |

**Your Target "Dry Weight":**
- This is your ideal weight without extra fluid
- Your doctor will help determine this
- It may change over time
- Adjust diuretics to maintain this weight

**Tips for Accurate Weights:**
- Use a digital scale
- Keep a weight log or use an app
- Set a daily alarm as a reminder
- Share your log at doctor visits

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Self-Adjustment Protocols:**

Many HF programs teach patients to adjust their own diuretics based on weight:

**Example Protocol:**
| Weight Change | Diuretic Adjustment |
|---------------|---------------------|
| +2-3 lbs overnight | Take an extra dose of your diuretic |
| +4+ lbs overnight | Double your diuretic dose and call clinic |
| +5 lbs in a week | Call clinic for guidance |
| -2+ lbs in a day (without trying) | Skip one dose, watch for dizziness, call if concerned |
| Symptoms of congestion | Extra diuretic dose and call clinic |
| Symptoms of dehydration | Hold diuretic and call clinic |

**Red Flags That Need Medical Attention:**
- Significant weight gain AND increasing shortness of breath
- Can't breathe when lying flat
- Need more pillows to sleep
- Waking up at night short of breath
- Swelling getting worse despite extra diuretic
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Confusion
- Chest pain

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Transitioning to Congestion-Free State:**

**Achieving Euvolemia:**
- Goal: Resolve all signs/symptoms of congestion while maintaining adequate perfusion
- Clinical markers: Flat JVP, clear lungs, no edema, stable weight
- Hemodynamic markers: Normal filling pressures (PCWP <18, CVP <8)

**Dry Weight Determination:**
Iterative process, not fixed:
1. Aggressively diurese until:
   - Symptoms resolve
   - Signs of volume depletion appear (orthostasis, rising Cr)
2. Current weight becomes the "dry weight" target
3. Adjust as clinical status changes

**Diuretic Resistance Management:**
- Rule out non-adherence (salt, fluid, medications)
- Increase loop diuretic dose (often more effective than frequency)
- Add thiazide diuretic (metolazone, chlorothiazide) - "sequential nephron blockade"
- Consider continuous IV infusion vs. boluses
- IV diuretics for poor oral absorption (gut edema)
- Rule out low cardiac output (may need inotropes)

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Remote Monitoring and Implantable Hemodynamics:**

**CardioMEMS (Pulmonary Artery Pressure Monitoring):**
- CHAMPION trial: 37% reduction in HF hospitalizations
- Implanted PA pressure sensor
- Patient transmits daily from home
- Clinician adjusts medications based on filling pressures
- Treats congestion before symptoms develop

**Interpretation:**
| PA Pressure | Interpretation | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Diastolic <8 mmHg | Likely hypovolemic | Reduce diuretics |
| Diastolic 8-18 mmHg | Target range | Maintain |
| Diastolic 18-25 mmHg | Elevated, preclinical congestion | Increase diuretics |
| Diastolic >25 mmHg | Overt congestion | Aggressive diuresis |

**Other Remote Monitoring:**
- Implantable loop recorders with impedance monitoring
- CRT/ICD with OptiVol™ or HeartLogic™ alerts
- Daily vital sign monitoring with alerts
- Digital health platforms with weight, BP, symptoms

## Salt and Fluid Restriction

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**Watching salt and fluids helps prevent fluid buildup in your body.**

**Salt (Sodium) Tips:**
- Limit to 2,000-3,000 mg of sodium per day
- Don't add salt at the table
- Cook with herbs and spices instead of salt
- Avoid processed and packaged foods
- Check food labels for sodium content

**High-Salt Foods to Avoid:**
- Fast food and restaurant meals
- Canned soups and vegetables
- Deli meats and hot dogs
- Chips, crackers, pretzels
- Soy sauce, ketchup, salad dressings
- Frozen dinners
- Pizza

**Fluid Restriction:**
- Some patients need to limit fluids to 6-8 cups (1.5-2 liters) per day
- Ask your doctor if you need a fluid limit
- All liquids count: water, coffee, tea, juice, soup, ice cream, Jello

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Understanding Sodium and Fluids:**

**How Salt Causes Problems:**
- Sodium makes your body hold onto water
- Extra water increases blood volume
- More volume means more work for your heart
- Leads to swelling and shortness of breath

**Reading Food Labels:**
| Sodium Level | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| Sodium-free | Less than 5 mg per serving |
| Very low sodium | 35 mg or less per serving |
| Low sodium | 140 mg or less per serving |
| Reduced sodium | 25% less than regular version |
| Light in sodium | 50% less than regular version |

**Daily Sodium Targets:**
- General HF: <2,000-3,000 mg/day
- Advanced HF: <2,000 mg/day
- Some doctors recommend <1,500 mg/day

**Fluid Restriction Guidelines:**
- Not everyone with HF needs fluid restriction
- Usually recommended if:
  - Sodium level is low (<130 mEq/L)
  - Diuretics aren't controlling fluid well
  - Severe HF (Stage D)
- Typical restriction: 1.5-2 liters (6-8 cups) per day

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Practical Sodium Reduction Strategies:**

**Cooking Modifications:**
| Instead of | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Table salt | Herbs, spices, lemon, vinegar |
| Canned vegetables | Fresh or frozen (no salt added) |
| Regular broth | Low-sodium or no-salt broth |
| Soy sauce | Low-sodium soy sauce (use less) |
| Seasoning blends with salt | Mrs. Dash, herb blends |

**Restaurant Strategies:**
- Ask for sauces and dressings on the side
- Request no added salt
- Choose grilled over fried
- Share entrees or take half home
- Check nutrition information before ordering
- Avoid buffets

**Fluid Tracking Tips:**
- Use a measuring container to visualize your limit
- Suck on ice chips (counts as half volume when melted)
- Use smaller cups and glasses
- Distribute fluids throughout the day
- Avoid very salty foods that increase thirst
- Keep hard candy to moisten mouth

**Sample 2L Fluid Allowance:**
| Time | Amount | Running Total |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Breakfast | 8 oz | 240 mL |
| With medications | 4 oz | 360 mL |
| Mid-morning | 8 oz | 600 mL |
| Lunch | 8 oz | 840 mL |
| Afternoon | 8 oz | 1,080 mL |
| With medications | 4 oz | 1,200 mL |
| Dinner | 12 oz | 1,560 mL |
| Evening | 8 oz | 1,800 mL |
| Bedtime meds | 4 oz | 1,920 mL |

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Evidence and Controversies:**

**Sodium Restriction Evidence:**
- SODIUM-HF trial (2022): <1,500 mg/day sodium did NOT reduce events vs. usual care
- May improve symptoms and quality of life in some patients
- Overcorrection can be harmful (malnutrition, neurohormonal activation)
- Individualized approach recommended

**Current Recommendations:**
- Avoid excessive sodium (>4,000 mg/day)
- Moderate restriction (2,000-3,000 mg/day) reasonable
- Very strict restriction (<1,500 mg/day) not supported by outcomes data
- Focus on overall dietary quality (Mediterranean, DASH patterns)

**Fluid Restriction Evidence:**
- Limited data supporting routine restriction
- Benefit mainly in hyponatremia
- May worsen thirst, quality of life, medication adherence
- AVOID-HF trial: Excessive restriction associated with harm

**Hyponatremia in HF:**
| Sodium Level | Classification | Implications |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| 135-145 mEq/L | Normal | No restriction needed |
| 130-135 mEq/L | Mild hyponatremia | Moderate restriction |
| <130 mEq/L | Moderate-severe | Strict restriction, investigate cause |

### Complexity Level 5 (Expert)

**Pathophysiology and Management of Dilutional Hyponatremia:**

**Mechanisms in HF:**
- Neurohormonal activation (SNS, RAAS)
- Non-osmotic ADH (vasopressin) release
- Impaired free water excretion
- Diuretic-induced (thiazides worse than loops)

**Treatment Approach:**
1. Fluid restriction (1.0-1.5 L/day)
2. Loop diuretics (generate free water clearance)
3. Correct hypokalemia
4. Stop thiazides
5. GDMT optimization (may improve free water handling)
6. Vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans)

**Vaptans (Tolvaptan):**
- Block V2 receptor in collecting duct
- EVEREST: Improved sodium levels, no survival benefit
- Risk of rapid correction → osmotic demyelination
- Must monitor sodium closely during initiation
- Not a substitute for HF optimization

**Nutritional Assessment:**
Cardiac cachexia (unintentional weight loss >5% in 6 months) indicates:
- Very poor prognosis
- Systemic inflammation, neurohormonal activation
- Focus shifts from restriction to adequate nutrition
- May need caloric and protein supplementation
- Involves dietitian consultation

## When to Call Your Doctor

### Complexity Level 1 (Basic)

**Call your doctor or nurse right away if you have:**

**WEIGHT CHANGES:**
- Gained 3+ pounds in one day
- Gained 5+ pounds in one week

**BREATHING PROBLEMS:**
- More shortness of breath than usual
- Need more pillows to sleep
- Wake up at night short of breath
- Coughing more, especially at night

**SWELLING:**
- Feet, ankles, or legs more swollen
- Belly is getting bigger
- Clothes or shoes feel tighter

**OTHER SYMPTOMS:**
- Heart beating fast or irregularly
- Feeling more tired than usual
- Dizziness or lightheadedness
- Less appetite or nausea
- Confusion

**GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR CALL 911 IF:**
- Chest pain
- Fainting or severe dizziness
- Can't catch your breath even at rest
- Coughing up pink, foamy mucus

### Complexity Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Using Traffic Light Zones:**

**GREEN ZONE - All Clear**
Symptoms are stable. Continue your routine.
- Weight is stable (within 2 lbs of target)
- No increased shortness of breath
- No increased swelling
- Can do usual activities
- Sleeping well

**YELLOW ZONE - Caution**
Something has changed. Call your doctor/clinic today.
- Weight gain of 3+ lbs in a day or 5+ lbs in a week
- Increased shortness of breath
- More swelling than usual
- Waking up short of breath at night
- Increased coughing
- Needing more pillows
- Feeling more tired
- Decreased appetite
- Dizziness

**RED ZONE - Medical Alert**
You need help now. Call 911 or go to the ER.
- Severe shortness of breath at rest
- Chest pain or pressure
- Fainting or near-fainting
- Coughing up pink, frothy mucus
- New confusion
- Struggling to breathe

### Complexity Level 3 (Detailed)

**Symptom Diary and Communication:**

**What to Track Daily:**
| Item | How to Monitor |
|------|----------------|
| Weight | Same scale, same time, same clothes |
| Swelling | Check ankles, press to see if pitting occurs |
| Breathing | Note activities that cause shortness of breath |
| Activity | What you could do today vs. yesterday |
| Medications | Confirm all taken as prescribed |
| Salt | Estimate daily intake |
| Fluids | Measure and record total |
| Sleep | How many pillows, any nighttime symptoms |

**When Calling Your Doctor, Be Ready to Report:**
- Current weight and recent trend
- Symptoms and when they started
- Medications taken today
- Recent diet changes
- Recent salt or fluid intake
- Other relevant factors (illness, travel, missed doses)

**Questions to Ask Your Care Team:**
- What is my target weight?
- When should I take an extra diuretic?
- What symptoms require a call?
- What is my fluid limit?
- When is my next appointment?
- How do I contact you after hours?

### Complexity Level 4 (Advanced)

**Clinical Decision Support:**

**Congestion Score (for self-monitoring):**
| Sign/Symptom | Points |
|--------------|--------|
| Weight >2 lbs above dry weight | 1 |
| Leg swelling | 1 |
| Orthopnea (need more pillows) | 1 |
| PND (wake up short of breath) | 1 |
| Shortness of breath with activities that didn't cause it before | 1 |
| Decreased exercise tolerance | 1 |
| Total | /6 |

Score ≥2: Contact your HF team

**Distinguishing HF Worsening from Other Causes:**
| Symptom | HF Cause | Other Causes to Consider |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|
