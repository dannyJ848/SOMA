      summary: 'Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that makes it harder for the heart to pump blood, with three main types: dilated (stretched heart), hypertrophic (thickened heart), and restrictive (stiffened heart).',
      explanation: 'Cardiomyopathy literally means "disease of the heart muscle." It is a group of conditions where the heart muscle becomes abnormal in structure or function, making it more difficult for the heart to pump blood effectively to the rest of the body. Unlike coronary artery disease, which affects the blood vessels supplying the heart, cardiomyopathy directly affects the heart muscle itself.\n\nThere are three main types of cardiomyopathy, each named for how the heart muscle is affected:\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common type. In DCM, the heart chambers (especially the left ventricle) become enlarged and stretched, like a balloon that has been overinflated. The stretched muscle becomes weaker and cannot pump blood as forcefully. DCM can be caused by many things including viral infections, alcohol abuse, certain medications (some chemotherapy drugs), genetics (it runs in families in about one-third of cases), and sometimes no cause can be identified (idiopathic).\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition where the heart muscle becomes abnormally thick, particularly the wall between the two lower chambers (the septum). This thickening can make it harder for the heart to relax and fill with blood, and in some cases can obstruct the flow of blood out of the heart. HCM is usually inherited (genetic) and is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.\n\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the least common type. In RCM, the heart muscle becomes stiff and rigid, preventing it from expanding properly to fill with blood between heartbeats. The pumping function may remain normal initially, but the stiff walls cannot accommodate enough blood. RCM can be caused by infiltrative diseases (where abnormal substances deposit in the heart muscle) such as amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, and hemochromatosis.\n\nSymptoms of cardiomyopathy are similar across types and relate to the heart\'s inability to pump effectively. These include shortness of breath (especially during activity or when lying flat), fatigue, swelling in the legs, ankles, and feet, dizziness, and irregular heartbeats. Some people have no symptoms in the early stages.\n\nTreatment depends on the type and severity. It may include medications to improve heart function, reduce fluid buildup, control heart rhythm, and prevent blood clots. In some cases, devices (pacemakers, defibrillators) or surgery may be needed. In severe cases, a heart transplant may be considered.',

      clinicalNotes: 'Cardiomyopathy should be suspected in patients presenting with unexplained heart failure symptoms, especially in younger patients without traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Family screening is recommended when genetic cardiomyopathy is diagnosed. An echocardiogram is the initial test of choice to evaluate heart structure and function. Patients with HCM should be counseled about avoiding competitive sports until risk stratification is complete, as HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.'

      summary: 'Cardiomyopathies are classified as dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive, arrhythmogenic, and unclassified types, each with distinct morphologic features, etiologies, hemodynamic patterns, and evidence-based treatment strategies.',
      explanation: 'Cardiomyopathies encompass a heterogeneous group of myocardial diseases defined by structural and functional abnormalities of the heart muscle in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease, or congenital heart disease sufficient to explain the observed abnormality. The classification system has evolved from purely morphologic to incorporating genetic, pathophysiologic, and clinical dimensions.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by left ventricular or biventricular dilation and systolic dysfunction (LVEF less than 45%). The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter is typically greater than 55 mm, and the ventricle assumes a spherical shape. Etiologies include genetic mutations (accounting for 30-40% of cases, most commonly truncating variants in TTN, the gene encoding titin), viral myocarditis (Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, parvovirus B19), alcohol (greater than 80 g/day for 5+ years), peripartum (presenting in the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum), chemotherapy-induced (anthracyclines dose-dependent, trastuzumab reversible), and idiopathic (no identifiable cause after thorough evaluation). Treatment follows guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: ACE inhibitor or ARB (or ARNI: sacubitril/valsartan), beta-blocker (carvedilol, metoprolol succinate, or bisoprolol), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and SGLT2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin). An ICD is recommended for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death when LVEF remains less than or equal to 35% after 3-6 months of optimized medical therapy.\n\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined by a maximal left ventricular wall thickness of 15 mm or greater (or 13-14 mm with a positive family history or genetic test) in the absence of loading conditions (hypertension, aortic stenosis) sufficient to explain the degree of hypertrophy. HCM is the most common genetic cardiovascular disease, with autosomal dominant inheritance and a prevalence of approximately 1:500. Approximately 60% of cases are caused by mutations in sarcomere protein genes, most commonly MYH7 (beta-myosin heavy chain) and MYBPC3 (myosin-binding protein C). Two-thirds of HCM patients have left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction (resting gradient greater than or equal to 30 mmHg or provoked gradient greater than or equal to 50 mmHg), termed hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Obstruction occurs from septal hypertrophy combined with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve. Treatment of symptomatic obstructive HCM includes beta-blockers, disopyramide (a negative inotrope that reduces LVOT gradient), and the novel cardiac myosin inhibitor mavacamten (Camzyos), which reduces LVOT gradient by decreasing actin-myosin cross-bridge formation. Septal reduction therapy (surgical septal myectomy or alcohol septal ablation) is reserved for patients with persistent severe symptoms despite medical therapy.\n\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is characterized by normal or near-normal ventricular dimensions and systolic function but severely impaired diastolic filling due to increased myocardial stiffness. Both atria are typically dilated. Key etiologies include cardiac amyloidosis (the most important cause to identify due to emerging specific therapies), sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, endomyocardial fibrosis, radiation-induced, and idiopathic. Cardiac amyloidosis is now recognized as two distinct diseases: light-chain (AL) amyloidosis (requiring chemotherapy directed at the plasma cell clone) and transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis (either hereditary from TTR gene mutations or wild-type ATTR, the latter increasingly recognized in elderly patients with heart failure and preserved or mildly reduced EF).\n\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is characterized by fibro-fatty replacement of the right ventricular myocardium, predisposing to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death. ARVC is caused by mutations in desmosomal genes (most commonly PKP2 encoding plakophilin-2). Diagnosis uses the revised Task Force Criteria incorporating structural, histologic, electrocardiographic, arrhythmic, and genetic criteria. Biventricular involvement is increasingly recognized.',

      clinicalNotes: 'Every patient with newly diagnosed DCM should be evaluated for reversible causes including coronary artery disease (catheterization or CTA), thyroid dysfunction, and alcohol use. Genetic testing and family screening are recommended for all DCM patients, especially with family history of heart failure, cardiomyopathy, or sudden death. For HCM, the first-line treatment for symptomatic LVOT obstruction is a non-vasodilating beta-blocker; avoid vasodilators, diuretics (when possible), and digoxin as they can worsen obstruction. Cardiac amyloidosis should be considered in any patient over 60 with unexplained heart failure, especially with concentric LV hypertrophy, low-voltage ECG (voltage-mass mismatch), and diastolic dysfunction.'

      summary: 'Advanced cardiomyopathy management integrates cardiac MRI tissue characterization, genetic testing with cascade screening, risk stratification for sudden death, advanced heart failure therapies, and disease-specific treatments including targeted therapies for cardiac amyloidosis.',
      explanation: 'Comprehensive cardiomyopathy management requires integration of advanced imaging for phenotyping, genetic diagnosis for family management, individualized risk stratification, and disease-specific therapeutic strategies.\n\nCardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is essential for cardiomyopathy evaluation. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) identifies myocardial fibrosis and scar with patterns that are often diagnostic: mid-wall linear LGE in DCM (associated with increased arrhythmic risk and adverse prognosis), patchy or transmural LGE in sarcoidosis, diffuse subendocardial or transmural LGE in amyloidosis, and RV free wall LGE in ARVC. T1 mapping provides quantitative assessment of myocardial tissue composition: elevated native T1 values in amyloidosis and fibrosis, low T1 in Anderson-Fabry disease (due to lipid accumulation) and hemochromatosis (due to iron deposition). T2 mapping detects myocardial edema, useful for identifying active inflammation in myocarditis and sarcoidosis. Extracellular volume (ECV) fraction, derived from pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping, provides a quantitative measure of interstitial expansion from fibrosis or infiltration. In cardiac amyloidosis, ECV is markedly elevated (greater than 40%) and correlates with prognosis.\n\nGenetic testing and cascade screening: Next-generation sequencing panels testing 50-100 cardiomyopathy-associated genes are now standard. For HCM, pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants are identified in approximately 30-60% of probands, most commonly in MYH7 and MYBPC3. For DCM, the yield is 20-40%, with TTN truncating variants being most common. Cascade screening of first-degree family members includes genetic testing for identified pathogenic variants plus serial clinical screening (ECG, echocardiography) regardless of genetic test results, as disease expression is age-dependent and may not manifest until adulthood. Variant interpretation uses the ACMG (American College of Medical Genetics) classification system: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign, and benign.\n\nSudden cardiac death (SCD) risk stratification differs by cardiomyopathy type. In DCM, LVEF less than or equal to 35% after optimized GDMT for 3-6 months is the primary criterion for ICD implantation. LGE on CMR provides incremental risk stratification even in patients with LVEF greater than 35%. In HCM, the 5-year SCD risk is estimated using the HCM Risk-SCD calculator (incorporating age, maximal wall thickness, LA diameter, LVOT gradient, family history of SCD, unexplained syncope, and NSVT) in European practice, or using a broader set of risk factors per ACC/AHA guidelines (which also include LGE extent on CMR, apical aneurysm, and LVEF less than 50%). ICD is recommended when 5-year SCD risk exceeds 6% (ESC) or when one or more major risk factors are present (ACC/AHA). In ARVC, ICD placement is recommended for patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, aborted SCD, or severe RV or LV dysfunction.\n\nCardiac amyloidosis-specific therapies have transformed management. For ATTR amyloidosis, tafamidis (Vyndaqel/Vyndamax) is a transthyretin stabilizer that prevents tetramer dissociation and amyloid fibril formation. The ATTR-ACT trial demonstrated that tafamidis reduced all-cause mortality by 30% and cardiovascular hospitalizations by 32% in ATTR-CM. Patisiran (an RNA interference agent) and inotersen (an antisense oligonucleotide) reduce hepatic TTR production and are approved for ATTR polyneuropathy with cardiac benefit being investigated. For AL amyloidosis, treatment targets the underlying plasma cell dyscrasia with chemotherapy regimens (cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone, daratumumab-based regimens) with hematologic response translating to cardiac improvement.\n\nAdvanced heart failure management for cardiomyopathy patients who progress despite optimized medical therapy includes cardiac resynchronization therapy (for LVEF less than or equal to 35%, QRS greater than or equal to 150 ms with LBBB), left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation as bridge to transplant or destination therapy, and heart transplantation. The HeartMate 3 continuous-flow centrifugal LVAD has demonstrated superior 2-year survival and reduced pump thrombosis compared to prior-generation devices. Patient selection for LVAD requires assessment of right ventricular function (critical for LVAD success), hepatic and renal function, nutritional status, and psychosocial factors.\n\nMyocarditis as a cause of DCM requires specific diagnostic and management considerations. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) remains the gold standard for diagnosing myocarditis etiology (viral, giant cell, eosinophilic, autoimmune). Giant cell myocarditis carries a particularly poor prognosis (median transplant-free survival 5.5 months without immunosuppression) and requires combined immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine, corticosteroids, azathioprine). Checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis (from cancer immunotherapy) is an emerging cause with high mortality requiring high-dose corticosteroids and potentially additional immunosuppression.',

      clinicalNotes: 'CMR should be performed in all newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy patients when available, as tissue characterization frequently changes the diagnosis and management plan. Technetium-99m pyrophosphate (PYP) scintigraphy is a highly sensitive and specific non-invasive test for ATTR cardiac amyloidosis (Grade 2 or 3 uptake with absent monoclonal protein is diagnostic without biopsy). Always exclude AL amyloidosis before diagnosing ATTR (check serum free light chains, serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation, and urine protein electrophoresis with immunofixation). For HCM patients, exercise provocation of LVOT gradient should be performed if the resting gradient is less than 50 mmHg, as latent obstruction affects management.'

      summary: 'Complex cardiomyopathy management encompasses genotype-phenotype correlations guiding prognosis, advanced CMR phenotyping with strain and mapping, disease-specific interventions for infiltrative cardiomyopathies, and multidisciplinary management of peripartum and cancer therapy-related cardiomyopathies.',
      explanation: 'Expert cardiomyopathy management integrates deep genotype-phenotype knowledge, advanced multimodality imaging, and disease-specific therapeutic strategies for complex clinical scenarios requiring multidisciplinary expertise.\n\nGenotype-phenotype correlations in DCM: TTN truncating variants (TTNtv) are the most common genetic cause of DCM, present in 15-25% of DCM probands. TTNtv-associated DCM tends to present with a milder phenotype, better response to medical therapy, and higher rates of LV recovery compared to other genetic causes. LMNA (lamin A/C) mutations are the most prognostically significant, associated with prominent conduction disease, malignant arrhythmias (sustained VT, SCD), and progressive heart failure. LMNA carriers warrant prophylactic ICD at an LVEF threshold of less than 45% (lower than the standard 35% threshold) due to the high arrhythmic risk relative to the degree of systolic dysfunction. The LMNA risk calculator estimates 5-year SCD risk based on NSVT, LVEF, sex, and type of mutation (non-missense mutations carry higher risk). DSP (desmoplakin) mutations cause a distinct cardiomyopathy with left-dominant arrhythmogenic features, episodic myocarditis-like presentations, and LGE in a ring-like subepicardial pattern.\n\nAdvanced CMR phenotyping extends beyond standard LGE to include feature tracking strain analysis (detecting subclinical dysfunction in genotype-positive, phenotype-negative family members), 4D flow imaging (evaluating intracardiac flow patterns altered by cardiomyopathy), perfusion assessment for microvascular dysfunction, and serial T1/ECV mapping to monitor treatment response in infiltrative diseases. CMR-guided endomyocardial biopsy targets areas of active inflammation identified by T2 mapping or LGE, increasing diagnostic yield compared to blind biopsy.\n\nAnderson-Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-galactosidase A deficiency leading to globotriaosylceramide accumulation in cardiomyocytes and other tissues. Cardiac manifestations include progressive LV hypertrophy (mimicking HCM), diastolic dysfunction, conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias. CMR shows characteristically low native T1 values (below 900 ms at 1.5T) due to lipid accumulation, with LGE appearing in the inferolateral wall as disease progresses. Enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase alfa or beta) and oral chaperone therapy (migalastat for amenable GLA mutations) can stabilize or improve cardiac outcomes when initiated before irreversible fibrosis develops.\n\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) presents a unique management challenge at the intersection of cardiology and obstetrics. GDMT should be initiated with pregnancy-safe alternatives: hydralazine-nitrate combination instead of ACEi/ARB (teratogenic), beta-blockers (metoprolol preferred; avoid atenolol), and diuretics as needed. Bromocriptine (a prolactin inhibitor) has shown promise in accelerating LV recovery based on the BROMAC study, though it requires anticoagulation due to thrombotic risk and suppresses lactation. Approximately 50% of PPCM patients recover LV function within 6-12 months. Risk factors for non-recovery include severe LV dilation at presentation, LVEF less than 25%, RV involvement, and African American ethnicity.\n\nCancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) encompasses cardiotoxicity from multiple agents. Anthracycline toxicity is dose-dependent (risk increases significantly above cumulative doxorubicin dose of 400 mg/m2), mediated by topoisomerase 2-beta inhibition and reactive oxygen species generation, and is often irreversible. Trastuzumab toxicity is typically reversible upon drug discontinuation but requires serial monitoring (echocardiography with GLS every 3 months). Immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis is the most acutely dangerous (mortality 25-50% without rapid treatment). A multidisciplinary cardio-oncology approach including baseline cardiovascular risk assessment, serial cardiac monitoring during treatment (GLS is more sensitive than LVEF for early detection), and early initiation of cardioprotective therapy (neurohormonal blockade, dexrazoxane for anthracyclines) is essential.\n\nTakotsubo cardiomyopathy (stress cardiomyopathy) is an increasingly recognized cause of acute ventricular dysfunction, typically triggered by physical or emotional stress. Classic apical ballooning is the most common pattern, but mid-ventricular, basal (reverse Takotsubo), and focal variants are recognized. CMR shows myocardial edema on T2 mapping without scar on LGE, distinguishing it from acute MI. Complications include LVOT obstruction (from basal hyperkinesis in apical ballooning variant), cardiogenic shock (10-15%), and arrhythmias. Recovery typically occurs within 1-4 weeks, but recurrence occurs in approximately 5% and long-term prognosis is not as benign as previously thought.',

      summary: 'Frontier cardiomyopathy science encompasses gene therapy and gene editing for inherited cardiomyopathies, iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte disease modeling, RNA-based therapeutics for TTR amyloidosis, precision medicine classification beyond morphology, and emerging small-molecule therapeutics targeting specific molecular pathways.',
      explanation: 'The frontier of cardiomyopathy science integrates molecular genetics, gene therapy, stem cell technology, and precision medicine approaches that are reshaping the understanding and treatment of myocardial diseases.\n\nGene therapy for inherited cardiomyopathies is rapidly advancing. For Danon disease (X-linked lysosomal cardiomyopathy caused by LAMP2 deficiency), adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9)-mediated gene replacement therapy delivering a functional LAMP2B transgene is in clinical trials (Rocket Pharmaceuticals RP-A501), representing one of the first cardiac gene therapy programs. For PKP2-associated ARVC, AAV-mediated PKP2 gene delivery to restore desmosomal function is in preclinical development (Tenaya Therapeutics). CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approaches are being explored for HCM caused by dominant-negative mutations in MYH7, where allele-specific silencing could eliminate the mutant transcript while preserving the normal allele. Base editing (a more precise form of genome editing that converts single nucleotides without double-strand breaks) is being developed for ATTR amyloidosis to correct specific TTR mutations (Verve Therapeutics). The challenge for cardiac gene therapy includes achieving sufficient myocardial transduction, avoiding immune responses to viral vectors, and ensuring durable transgene expression.\n\nInduced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocyte disease modeling creates patient-specific cellular models of cardiomyopathy in the laboratory. Skin cells or blood cells from patients are reprogrammed to iPSCs, then differentiated into cardiomyocytes that carry the patient\'s exact genetic mutation. These disease-in-a-dish models recapitulate key features of HCM (hypercontractility, sarcomere disarray, abnormal calcium handling), DCM (reduced contractility, impaired sarcomere organization), and ARVC (lipid accumulation, desmosomal dysfunction). iPSC-cardiomyocytes enable high-throughput drug screening to identify compounds that reverse disease phenotype, personalized pharmacotherapy testing, and validation of gene therapy approaches before clinical application. Three-dimensional engineered heart tissue models using iPSC-cardiomyocytes more accurately represent myocardial mechanics and force generation than two-dimensional cultures.\n\nRNA-based therapeutics for cardiac amyloidosis represent a transformative treatment paradigm. Patisiran (RNA interference) and vutrisiran (next-generation siRNA with longer dosing interval) silence hepatic TTR mRNA, reducing circulating TTR protein by approximately 80%. The HELIOS-B trial for vutrisiran in ATTR-CM showed significant mortality benefit. NTLA-2001 (Intellia Therapeutics) is a CRISPR/Cas9-based in vivo gene editing therapy delivered via lipid nanoparticles that permanently inactivates the TTR gene in hepatocytes, achieving over 90% TTR protein reduction from a single infusion. This approach could provide a one-time curative treatment for ATTR amyloidosis. Anti-amyloid antibodies and small molecules that promote fibril clearance are being investigated to address already-deposited amyloid, complementing production-reducing therapies.\n\nPrecision medicine classification of cardiomyopathies is moving beyond traditional morphologic categories (dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive) toward molecular and mechanistic taxonomy. The MOGE(S) classification system incorporates Morphologic descriptor, Organ involvement, Genetic/familial basis, Etiologic annotation, and functional Status. Transcriptomic profiling of myocardial tissue identifies molecular subtypes within morphologic categories that respond differently to treatment. For example, within the DCM category, patients with inflammatory transcriptional signatures may benefit from immunomodulatory therapy, while those with fibrotic signatures may benefit from anti-fibrotic agents. Circulating microRNA profiles and proteomics-based biomarker panels are being developed as blood-based molecular classifiers that could guide therapy selection without myocardial biopsy.\n\nEmerging small-molecule therapeutics target specific molecular pathways in cardiomyopathy. Beyond mavacamten, next-generation cardiac myosin inhibitors (aficamten) offer potentially improved safety profiles. Omecamtiv mecarbil, a cardiac myosin activator, increases systolic function without increasing intracellular calcium and demonstrated reduced heart failure events in DCM patients in the GALACTIC-HF trial. Novel anti-fibrotic agents targeting TGF-beta signaling, galectin-3, and lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2) are in development for cardiomyopathies with prominent fibrotic remodeling. SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated benefit across the spectrum of heart failure (reduced and preserved EF) regardless of cardiomyopathy etiology, with mechanisms involving improved myocardial energetics, reduced inflammation, and enhanced autophagy.\n\nWearable and implantable monitoring technologies are enabling continuous assessment of cardiomyopathy patients, including continuous ECG monitoring for arrhythmia detection, hemodynamic monitoring via implantable PA pressure sensors, and serial assessment of thoracic impedance and heart rate variability for early detection of decompensation. Integration of these multi-parameter datasets with machine learning algorithms creates personalized disease trajectory models that can predict clinical deterioration before symptomatic presentation.',

The molecular subtyping of cardiomyopathies will increasingly guide therapy selection; clinicians should anticipate a future where myocardial biopsy with transcriptomic analysis becomes a standard component of cardiomyopathy evaluation.'
