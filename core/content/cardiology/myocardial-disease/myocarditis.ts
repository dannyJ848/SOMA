      summary: 'Myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle (myocardium) that can weaken the heart and affect its ability to pump blood effectively.',
      explanation: 'The heart is a muscular organ that pumps blood throughout the body. Myocarditis occurs when the heart muscle becomes inflamed, usually due to a viral infection. This inflammation can damage heart muscle cells and weaken the heart. Think of it like a swelling injury to any other muscle in the body, except this muscle is responsible for pumping blood to keep you alive. When the heart muscle is inflamed, it cannot contract as strongly or as regularly, which can lead to symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, and abnormal heartbeats. In mild cases, the inflammation resolves on its own and the heart recovers fully. In severe cases, myocarditis can lead to heart failure, dangerous heart rhythms, or even sudden cardiac death. Myocarditis can affect people of any age but is most common in young, otherwise healthy adults. Many cases follow a recent cold or flu-like illness. The condition is diagnosed through blood tests, imaging of the heart, and sometimes a biopsy of heart tissue. Treatment focuses on rest, managing symptoms, and supporting the heart while it heals.',

      summary: 'Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium most commonly caused by viral infections, presenting with chest pain, heart failure, or arrhythmias, and diagnosed using troponin, echocardiography, and cardiac MRI.',
      explanation: 'Myocarditis is characterized by inflammatory infiltration of the myocardium with necrosis or degeneration of adjacent myocytes. The most common cause is viral infection, particularly coxsackievirus B, adenovirus, parvovirus B19, and human herpesvirus 6. Other causes include autoimmune diseases, drug reactions (hypersensitivity myocarditis), and toxins. The clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from subclinical disease to fulminant heart failure and cardiogenic shock. Common presenting symptoms include chest pain (often pleuritic, mimicking pericarditis since the two conditions frequently coexist as myopericarditis), dyspnea, palpitations, fatigue, and signs of heart failure such as peripheral edema and jugular venous distention. Some patients present with sudden cardiac death as the first manifestation, particularly young athletes. Diagnosis begins with laboratory studies showing elevated cardiac troponin (indicating myocyte injury) and elevated inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR). An ECG may show ST-segment changes, T-wave inversions, or arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia. Echocardiography assesses ventricular function and may reveal wall motion abnormalities, reduced ejection fraction, or pericardial effusion. Cardiac MRI (CMR) has become the primary non-invasive diagnostic tool, using the Lake Louise Criteria to identify myocardial edema (T2-weighted imaging), hyperemia/capillary leak (early gadolinium enhancement), and necrosis/fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement). The pattern of late gadolinium enhancement in myocarditis is characteristically mid-wall or epicardial, in contrast to the subendocardial or transmural pattern seen in myocardial infarction. Treatment is primarily supportive: heart failure is managed with guideline-directed medical therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARBs, beta-blockers, diuretics), arrhythmias are treated as needed, and patients are advised strict activity restriction for 3 to 6 months. In fulminant cases, mechanical circulatory support (such as an LVAD or ECMO) may be required as a bridge to recovery.',

The LGE pattern on cardiac MRI is critical: myocarditis shows mid-wall or epicardial enhancement, while MI shows subendocardial or transmural enhancement in a coronary distribution. Coronary angiography is often performed to rule out obstructive coronary disease.'

      summary: 'Myocarditis encompasses a spectrum of inflammatory myocardial diseases with viral, autoimmune, and toxic etiologies; endomyocardial biopsy remains the diagnostic gold standard with Dallas criteria for histologic classification, while cardiac MRI provides high-sensitivity non-invasive diagnosis.',
      explanation: 'The pathophysiology of viral myocarditis involves three phases. Phase 1 (acute viral phase, days 0-3) involves direct viral invasion and replication within cardiomyocytes, causing direct cytotoxic injury. The virus enters cardiomyocytes via specific receptors (e.g., coxsackievirus enters through the coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor, CAR). Phase 2 (autoimmune phase, days 4-14) involves activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Viral antigens are presented to T-lymphocytes, triggering infiltration of the myocardium by cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and macrophages. Molecular mimicry between viral and cardiac proteins can trigger autoimmune responses against the heart. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6) amplify the inflammatory cascade. Phase 3 (recovery or dilated cardiomyopathy) represents either resolution of inflammation with myocardial healing, or progression to chronic inflammation and fibrosis leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) is the definitive diagnostic test and is classified using the Dallas Criteria: active myocarditis shows inflammatory infiltrate with myocyte necrosis, borderline myocarditis shows inflammatory infiltrate without necrosis, and no myocarditis shows no inflammatory infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry enhances sensitivity by detecting CD3+ T-cells, CD68+ macrophages, and HLA class II upregulation. The World Heart Federation criteria define inflammation as at least 14 leukocytes/mm2 including up to 4 monocytes with CD3+ T-lymphocytes of at least 7/mm2. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on biopsy specimens can identify specific viral genomes. Specific subtypes warrant attention: giant cell myocarditis presents with rapidly progressive heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and high mortality (up to 70% at 1 year without transplant), requiring immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Eosinophilic myocarditis may be associated with hypereosinophilic syndrome, parasitic infection, or drug hypersensitivity and responds to corticosteroids. Cardiac sarcoidosis involves non-caseating granulomas and may present with conduction disease, ventricular arrhythmias, or heart failure. Treatment of giant cell myocarditis and cardiac sarcoidosis often requires immunosuppression, whereas routine viral myocarditis does not benefit from immunosuppression. NSAIDs should be avoided in acute myocarditis as they may increase myocardial inflammation and mortality in animal models. Exercise restriction is recommended for at least 3-6 months with repeat cardiac imaging demonstrating resolution before return to competitive sports.',

The sensitivity of EMB is limited by sampling error (approximately 50-60% for single-site biopsy) due to the often patchy distribution of myocardial inflammation.'

      summary: 'Advanced management of myocarditis involves immunohistochemical and molecular biopsy analysis, targeted immunosuppressive protocols for specific subtypes, mechanical circulatory support for fulminant cases, and risk stratification for arrhythmias and progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.',
      explanation: 'Advanced diagnostic evaluation integrates multimodality assessment. Updated Lake Louise Criteria (2018) for cardiac MRI include two main criteria: T2-based criteria (myocardial edema demonstrated by regional or global increase in T2 signal intensity on T2-weighted images or elevated T2 mapping values) and T1-based criteria (myocardial injury shown by non-ischemic pattern of late gadolinium enhancement, increased native T1 mapping values, or increased extracellular volume fraction). The presence of both T1 and T2 criteria provides high diagnostic accuracy with sensitivity of 87-88% and specificity of 96%. Feature tracking CMR and strain analysis can detect subtle contractile dysfunction. PET-CT with FDG is valuable for diagnosing cardiac sarcoidosis by detecting active granulomatous inflammation. Advanced biopsy analysis includes viral genome detection by PCR (parvovirus B19, HHV6, enterovirus, adenovirus, EBV, CMV), gene expression profiling, and assessment of viral load. Importantly, parvovirus B19 can be found in biopsy specimens of patients without myocarditis (latent infection), so viral presence alone does not confirm viral myocarditis; clinical correlation with inflammation on immunohistochemistry is essential. Therapeutic strategies are etiology-specific. For virus-negative, autoimmune myocarditis (confirmed by biopsy showing inflammation without viral genome), immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone plus azathioprine has shown benefit in the TIMIC trial, with improvement in LVEF. For virus-positive myocarditis, antiviral strategies including interferon-beta have been studied (BICC trial) with some evidence of viral clearance and functional improvement. Giant cell myocarditis requires aggressive immunosuppression: standard protocol includes cyclosporine (targeting trough levels of 150-250 ng/mL), corticosteroids, and often azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Even with immunosuppression, 5-year transplant-free survival is only approximately 50%. Fulminant myocarditis, paradoxically, has a better long-term prognosis than acute non-fulminant myocarditis if the patient survives the acute phase (93% vs. 45% survival at 11 years in one landmark study). Aggressive hemodynamic support with inotropes, IABP, percutaneous VADs (Impella), VA-ECMO, or surgically implanted temporary VADs can bridge patients to recovery. Arrhythmia management requires careful consideration: ICD implantation should be deferred during the acute inflammatory phase, as arrhythmias may resolve with inflammation. A wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (LifeVest) can provide interim protection. Persistent ventricular arrhythmias or reduced LVEF after 3-6 months of optimal therapy warrant reassessment for ICD implantation per standard heart failure guidelines.',

      ],
      clinicalNotes: 'A critical management decision is whether to immunosuppress. The algorithm should be: (1) Perform EMB with immunohistochemistry and viral PCR. (2) If virus-negative with inflammation, consider immunosuppression (prednisone + azathioprine). (3) If virus-positive with inflammation, consider antiviral therapy (interferon-beta) before immunosuppression. (4) If no inflammation and no virus, diagnosis should be reconsidered. Premature immunosuppression in viral myocarditis can increase viral replication and worsen outcomes.'

      summary: 'Expert-level myocarditis management encompasses precision diagnostics with multi-omics biopsy profiling, novel immunomodulatory therapies, advanced mechanical circulatory support algorithms, myocarditis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, and emerging biomarkers for predicting progression to dilated cardiomyopathy.',
      explanation: 'Contemporary understanding of myocarditis pathogenesis integrates genomic susceptibility, viral tropism, and immune dysregulation. Genome-wide association studies have identified susceptibility loci including variants in HLA genes, particularly HLA-DQ and HLA-DR alleles that predispose to autoimmune myocarditis. Transgenic mouse models have elucidated the roles of specific cytokines: IL-17A promotes neutrophilic infiltration and cardiac fibrosis, while regulatory T-cells (Tregs) expressing FoxP3 are protective against autoimmune myocardial damage. The microRNA profile in myocarditis is an emerging diagnostic and prognostic tool; miR-208b and miR-499 are released from damaged cardiomyocytes and correlate with troponin elevation, while miR-21 and miR-155 reflect inflammatory activity and fibrotic remodeling. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) myocarditis has emerged as a critical entity in the era of cancer immunotherapy. Anti-PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab), anti-PD-L1 (atezolizumab), and anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) therapies can trigger fulminant myocarditis with mortality rates of 25-50%. The mechanism involves loss of immune tolerance to cardiac antigens, with shared antigens between tumor and myocardium (e.g., alpha-myosin heavy chain). Diagnosis requires high clinical suspicion, as troponin elevation may be the earliest sign. EMB shows T-lymphocyte predominant infiltration. Management requires immediate ICI discontinuation, high-dose methylprednisolone (1 g/day for 3 days followed by taper), and in steroid-refractory cases, addition of mycophenolate, anti-thymocyte globulin, abatacept (CTLA-4 agonist), or alemtuzumab. Combination ICI therapy (anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4) carries the highest risk. Advanced prognostic stratification uses multi-parametric CMR including T1 mapping, T2 mapping, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and global longitudinal strain (GLS) at baseline and follow-up. Higher baseline native T1, elevated ECV, and impaired GLS predict progression to chronic dilated cardiomyopathy. Persistent LGE at 6-month follow-up indicates irreversible fibrosis and worse prognosis. Novel therapeutic approaches under investigation include: (1) Anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist) targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in viral myocarditis; (2) Abatacept (CTLA-4-Ig) for T-cell mediated myocarditis; (3) Anti-IL-17 antibodies (secukinumab) for neutrophilic inflammation; (4) Mesenchymal stem cell therapy for immunomodulation and myocardial regeneration; and (5) Colchicine as adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy. Mechanical circulatory support decision algorithms for fulminant myocarditis consider cardiac index, vasoactive-inotropic score, lactate trends, and organ perfusion. Escalation typically proceeds from inotropes to IABP/Impella to VA-ECMO, with biventricular failure often necessitating central cannulation. The INTERMACS profile guides timing of durable LVAD implantation vs. continued temporary support. For patients progressing to end-stage cardiomyopathy, heart transplantation is definitive therapy; however, giant cell myocarditis has a recurrence rate of 20-25% in the transplanted heart. COVID-19 associated myocarditis has added complexity: SARS-CoV-2 can cause direct viral myocarditis, cytokine storm-mediated myocardial injury, and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C/MIS-A). The distinction between true myocarditis and myocardial injury with elevated troponin (without inflammation on CMR/biopsy) is clinically important and affects management and return-to-play decisions in athletes.',

Obtain EMB for confirmation but treat empirically. Monitor for concomitant myasthenia gravis and myositis (the triad of ICI cardiac toxicity) by checking CK, anti-AChR antibodies, and performing neurological examination.'
