      summary: 'Aortic valve disease involves problems with the valve between the heart\'s main pumping chamber (left ventricle) and the body\'s largest artery (aorta), including narrowing (stenosis) and leaking (regurgitation).',
      explanation: 'The aortic valve is one of four valves in the heart. It acts like a one-way door between the left ventricle (the heart\'s main pumping chamber) and the aorta (the large artery that carries blood to the body). Normally, this valve has three flaps (cusps) that open to let blood flow out during each heartbeat and close tightly to prevent blood from flowing backward. Aortic stenosis occurs when the valve becomes narrowed and stiff, making it harder for the heart to push blood through. This is like trying to push water through a partially blocked pipe. The heart muscle must work harder to pump blood through the narrowed valve, and over time this extra work causes the heart muscle to thicken. Common causes include age-related calcium buildup on the valve (the most common cause in older adults) and having a bicuspid aortic valve (born with only two cusps instead of three). Symptoms include chest pain during exertion, fainting (syncope), and shortness of breath, though the disease can be present for years without symptoms. Aortic regurgitation occurs when the valve does not close properly, allowing blood to leak back into the left ventricle. This means the heart has to pump the same blood twice, eventually causing the ventricle to enlarge. Both conditions can eventually lead to heart failure if untreated. Severe aortic stenosis typically requires valve replacement, while the timing for aortic regurgitation surgery depends on symptoms and heart function.',

      clinicalNotes: 'Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease in developed countries, primarily affecting elderly patients. The classic symptom triad is angina (chest pain), syncope (fainting), and dyspnea (shortness of breath). Once symptoms develop, prognosis without intervention deteriorates rapidly.'

      summary: 'Aortic stenosis is graded by valve area and pressure gradient, with severe stenosis (valve area less than 1.0 cm2) requiring intervention. Aortic regurgitation is classified by regurgitant volume and ventricular dimensions, with surgery guided by symptoms and LV dilation.',
      explanation: 'Aortic stenosis (AS) severity is determined by echocardiography. Key parameters include: aortic valve area (normal 3-4 cm2; severe AS is less than 1.0 cm2), peak aortic jet velocity (severe is greater than 4 m/s), and mean transvalvular pressure gradient (severe is greater than 40 mmHg). The most common etiology in patients over 65 is calcific (degenerative) disease, while in younger patients, bicuspid aortic valve is the most common cause. Rheumatic heart disease remains an important cause worldwide. The pathophysiology involves progressive valve narrowing leading to a chronic pressure overload on the left ventricle. The ventricle compensates with concentric hypertrophy (wall thickening without chamber dilation) to normalize wall stress. This compensation maintains cardiac output for years (the long asymptomatic phase). Eventually, the hypertrophied ventricle becomes stiff, diastolic dysfunction develops, and cardiac output falls, producing symptoms. The classic symptom triad has important prognostic implications: once angina develops, average survival without valve replacement is 5 years; once syncope develops, 3 years; once heart failure develops, 2 years. Auscultation reveals a harsh, crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the right upper sternal border, radiating to the carotids. A diminished and delayed carotid upstroke (pulsus parvus et tardus) is a classic physical finding. Aortic regurgitation (AR) can be acute or chronic. Acute AR (from endocarditis, aortic dissection, or trauma) is a surgical emergency because the left ventricle cannot accommodate the sudden volume overload. Chronic AR causes progressive eccentric hypertrophy (chamber dilation with proportional wall thickening) as the ventricle adapts to volume overload. Severe chronic AR is defined by regurgitant volume greater than 60 mL, regurgitant fraction greater than 50%, or effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) greater than 0.30 cm2. Physical findings include a wide pulse pressure (bounding pulses), a decrescendo diastolic murmur along the left sternal border, and numerous eponymous signs reflecting the large stroke volume (de Musset sign, Quincke pulses, Corrigan pulse). Surgery is indicated for symptomatic severe AS, symptomatic severe AR, or asymptomatic severe AR with LV systolic dysfunction (LVEF less than 50%) or significant LV dilation (LV end-systolic dimension greater than 50 mm).',

      clinicalNotes: 'Low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis is a diagnostic pitfall: patients with reduced LV function may have a small valve area but low gradient (less than 40 mmHg) because the weakened ventricle cannot generate sufficient flow. Dobutamine stress echocardiography helps differentiate true severe AS (valve area remains small with augmented flow) from pseudo-severe AS (valve area increases with augmented flow).'

      summary: 'Aortic valve disease management integrates multimodality imaging for severity assessment, risk stratification for intervention timing, TAVR versus surgical AVR decision-making, and management of associated aortopathy in bicuspid valve disease.',
      explanation: 'Advanced severity assessment of aortic stenosis addresses the clinical conundrum of discordant grading. Classical severe AS has concordant parameters: AVA less than 1.0 cm2, Vmax greater than 4 m/s, and mean gradient greater than 40 mmHg. However, discordant findings are common. Low-flow, low-gradient severe AS (LFLG) exists in two forms: (1) Classical LFLG-AS with reduced LVEF (less than 50%): low stroke volume cannot generate high gradients despite truly severe stenosis. Dobutamine stress echo differentiates true severe AS (AVA remains less than 1.0 cm2 with increased flow, and gradient rises above 40 mmHg) from pseudo-severe AS (AVA increases above 1.0 cm2 as flow increases). Patients with true severe AS benefit from intervention; those without flow reserve (failure to increase stroke volume by more than 20% with dobutamine) have highest operative risk but may still benefit. (2) Paradoxical LFLG-AS with preserved LVEF: small LV cavity with restrictive physiology produces low stroke volume index (less than 35 mL/m2) despite normal EF. Aortic valve calcium scoring by CT helps resolve ambiguity (severe AS: greater than 2000 AU in men, greater than 1200 AU in women by Agatston scoring). The 2020 ACC/AHA guidelines introduced an important paradigm shift: intervention for asymptomatic severe AS is now considered reasonable (Class IIa) when very severe stenosis is present (Vmax greater than 5 m/s), rapid progression occurs (increase in Vmax greater than 0.3 m/s per year), or exercise testing reveals symptoms or hemodynamic abnormality. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has revolutionized AS management. The PARTNER trials and CoreValve trials established TAVR as: superior to medical therapy in inoperable patients (PARTNER 1B), non-inferior to SAVR in high-risk patients (PARTNER 1A, CoreValve High Risk), non-inferior to SAVR in intermediate-risk patients (PARTNER 2A, SURTAVI), and non-inferior or superior to SAVR in low-risk patients (PARTNER 3, Evolut Low Risk). Current valve-in-valve TAVR is also an option for degenerated surgical bioprosthetic valves. However, concerns about long-term valve durability, paravalvular leak, conduction disturbances requiring pacemaker (10-20% for self-expanding valves), and leaflet thrombosis remain. Younger patients (under 65) generally still favor SAVR with a mechanical valve (lifelong anticoagulation) or bioprosthetic valve (potential future redo surgery or valve-in-valve TAVR). Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) affects 1-2% of the population and is the most common congenital cardiac anomaly. BAV is associated with aortopathy: ascending aortic dilation (50-70% of BAV patients), with increased risk of dissection. The Sievers classification describes BAV morphology. Current guidelines recommend prophylactic aortic surgery when the ascending aorta reaches 5.5 cm, or 5.0 cm with risk factors (family history of dissection, rapid growth greater than 0.5 cm/year, or coarctation). At the time of AVR in BAV patients, concomitant aortic replacement is recommended if the aorta exceeds 4.5 cm.',

      clinicalNotes: 'TAVR vs. SAVR decision-making in 2024 follows the heart team approach. Key considerations favoring TAVR: advanced age (>75), high surgical risk (STS score >8%), severe frailty, porcelain aorta, hostile chest. Key considerations favoring SAVR: younger age (<65), low surgical risk, bicuspid valve (though TAVR is increasingly used), need for concomitant CABG or other valve surgery, and concerns about long-term TAVR durability.'

      summary: 'Advanced aortic valve management encompasses complex hemodynamic assessment, structural CT planning for TAVR, management of TAVR complications, valve-in-valve strategies, and integration of emerging technologies including cerebral embolic protection and novel valve platforms.',
      explanation: 'Pre-procedural TAVR planning relies heavily on multidetector CT angiography (MDCTA). The CT protocol encompasses: (1) Aortic annular sizing: the aortic annulus is an oval structure, and CT provides the annular perimeter, area, and derived diameter for prosthesis sizing. Undersizing causes paravalvular leak (PVL); oversizing causes annular rupture. The recommended oversizing range is typically 5-15% by area. (2) Coronary height assessment: low coronary ostia (less than 10-12 mm from the annular plane) or narrow sinuses of Valsalva increase risk of coronary obstruction. For valve-in-valve procedures in small surgical valves, virtual commissural alignment and BASILICA (Bioprosthetic or Native Aortic Scallop Intentional Laceration to Prevent Iatrogenic Coronary Artery obstruction) may be needed. (3) Peripheral access assessment: iliofemoral artery dimensions (minimum 5.0-6.5 mm depending on valve system), calcification, and tortuosity determine transfemoral feasibility. Alternative access routes include transapical, transaortic, transaxillary/subclavian, and transcaval. TAVR complications and management: (1) Paravalvular leak: reduced with newer-generation valves featuring outer sealing skirts. Significant PVL after deployment may require post-dilation or a second (snug) valve implantation. (2) Conduction disturbances: the proximity of the aortic annulus to the His bundle and left bundle branch makes LBBB and complete heart block common (5-10% balloon-expandable, 15-25% self-expanding). Higher implant depth, pre-existing RBBB, and membranous septum length less than device implant depth are predictors. (3) Stroke: occurs in 1-3% of TAVR procedures. Cerebral embolic protection devices (Sentinel device) capture debris during valve deployment, with some evidence of reduced silent cerebral infarcts. (4) Vascular complications: major vascular injury occurs in 5-8%, reduced with smaller-profile delivery systems. (5) Leaflet thrombosis: subclinical leaflet thrombosis detected by 4D CT occurs in 10-15% of TAVR valves, with unknown long-term implications. Anticoagulation resolves thrombosis, but routine anticoagulation post-TAVR is not currently recommended (POPular TAVI trial confirmed DAPT is not superior to aspirin alone). Advanced aortic regurgitation management: Chronic severe AR is monitored with serial echocardiography. Vasodilator therapy (nifedipine, ACE inhibitors) was historically used to delay surgery, but evidence is limited. Current guidelines focus on surgical timing based on symptoms, LVEF (less than 55% triggers intervention per ESC guidelines, less than 50% per ACC/AHA), and LV dimensions. LV end-systolic dimension greater than 50 mm (or indexed LVESD greater than 25 mm/m2) is a Class I surgical indication. For acute severe AR (endocarditis, dissection), emergent surgical valve replacement is indicated. Intra-aortic balloon pump is contraindicated in severe AR (augments regurgitation during diastole). TAVR for pure native aortic regurgitation remains challenging due to the absence of calcification for valve anchoring, though dedicated devices (JenaValve, J-Valve) with active fixation mechanisms are under investigation.',

      clinicalNotes: 'For valve-in-valve TAVR planning, the internal diameter of the degenerated surgical valve must be known (from the manufacturer specifications). Patient-prosthesis mismatch (effective orifice area index less than 0.65 cm2/m2 for severe PPM) is a significant concern, as implanting a TAVR valve inside an already small surgical valve further reduces the orifice. Supra-annular valve designs (e.g., Evolut) provide better hemodynamics in small surgical valves compared to intra-annular designs.'

      summary: 'Expert aortic valve disease management encompasses lifetime management strategies, durability considerations for different valve platforms, concomitant aortopathy genetics, novel transcatheter technologies, and computational modeling for procedural optimization.',
      explanation: 'Lifetime management of aortic valve disease requires consideration of the patient\'s expected lifespan and the durability of different valve options. For patients under 50, options include mechanical AVR (Ross procedure is an alternative with the patient\'s own pulmonary valve replacing the aortic valve and a homograft in the pulmonary position), which avoids anticoagulation but carries risks of neoaortic dilation and homograft degeneration requiring reintervention in 15-25% at 20 years. The ozaki procedure (aortic valve neocuspidization using autologous pericardium) is another emerging option. For patients aged 50-65, the choice between mechanical and bioprosthetic valves balances anticoagulation risks against reintervention risk. TAVR-in-SAVR (valve-in-valve) has added a new dimension: patients can receive a bioprosthetic SAVR with the understanding that future degeneration can be addressed with TAVR rather than redo surgery, enabling a "planned obsolescence" approach. For patients over 65-70, bioprosthetic SAVR or TAVR are standard. TAVR-in-TAVR (redo transcatheter) is technically feasible but limited by progressive reduction in effective orifice area with each nested valve and challenges with coronary access through multiple frames. Molecular biology of calcific aortic stenosis has revealed parallels with atherosclerosis: LDL deposition, oxidized phospholipids, Lp(a), and Notch1 signaling pathway dysregulation drive osteoblastic differentiation of valve interstitial cells. Despite this, statin trials (SALTIRE, SEAS, ASTRONOMER) failed to slow AS progression, suggesting that calcification proceeds through a self-sustaining pathway once initiated. Current research targets include Lp(a) lowering (which is independently associated with faster AS progression), PCSK9 inhibitors, and noncoding RNA therapeutics targeting osteogenic pathways. The genetics of bicuspid aortic valve disease and aortopathy involve NOTCH1 mutations (autosomal dominant, variable penetrance), GATA5, SMAD6, and other genes. FBN1 mutations (Marfan syndrome) and TGFBR1/2 mutations (Loeys-Dietz syndrome) cause syndromic aortopathy with aortic root dilation. The pattern of aortic dilation differs: BAV-associated aortopathy typically involves the tubular ascending aorta (often asymmetric dilation of the convexity), while Marfan predominantly involves the aortic root (sinuses of Valsalva). This distinction has surgical implications: BAV may require supracoronary aortic replacement, while Marfan typically requires aortic root replacement (David or Bentall procedure). Emerging technologies include: (1) Computer-assisted valve design and patient-specific simulation using computational fluid dynamics to optimize TAVR sizing and predict paravalvular leak. (2) Polymer transcatheter valves (TRISKELE) that may offer superior durability over biologic tissue. (3) Sutureless surgical valves (Perceval, INTUITY) that combine features of SAVR and TAVR with reduced cross-clamp times. (4) Transcatheter aortic valve repair (leaflet modification, calcium debridement) approaches for AS and AR that preserve native anatomy. (5) TAVR for moderate AS in heart failure patients (TAVR UNLOAD trial concept). (6) Artificial intelligence-based echocardiographic grading algorithms that may improve consistency of AS severity assessment.',

      clinicalNotes: 'The concept of "lifetime management" for aortic valve disease means planning the first intervention with consideration of future reinterventions. For a 50-year-old, the first bioprosthetic SAVR should be sized to accommodate future valve-in-valve TAVR (minimum 23mm surgical valve, ideally 25mm+ for adequate future TAVR orifice). This requires the operating surgeon to consider not just the current operation but the 20-30 year horizon of the patient\'s valve disease trajectory.'
