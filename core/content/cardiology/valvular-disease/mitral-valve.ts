      summary: 'Mitral valve disease involves problems with the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle, including narrowing (mitral stenosis), leaking (mitral regurgitation), and a condition where the valve leaflets bulge backward (mitral valve prolapse).',
      explanation: 'The mitral valve sits between two chambers on the left side of the heart: the left atrium (which receives blood from the lungs) and the left ventricle (the main pumping chamber). The valve has two flaps (leaflets) that open and close with each heartbeat to keep blood flowing in the right direction. Mitral stenosis occurs when the valve becomes narrowed and stiff, usually from rheumatic fever (an illness caused by untreated strep throat). The narrowed valve makes it harder for blood to flow from the atrium to the ventricle. Blood backs up in the left atrium and then into the lungs, causing shortness of breath, especially during exercise or when lying flat. Mitral regurgitation (also called mitral insufficiency) occurs when the valve does not close properly, allowing blood to leak backward from the ventricle into the atrium with each heartbeat. This can be caused by many conditions, including a heart attack that damages the muscles supporting the valve, infection of the valve (endocarditis), or degenerative changes. Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most common valve abnormality, affecting about 2-3% of the population. In MVP, the valve leaflets bulge (prolapse) backward into the atrium during the heartbeat. Most people with MVP have no symptoms and need no treatment, but a small percentage develop significant leaking that requires surgical repair. Treatment for mitral valve disease depends on the severity. Mild cases are monitored with regular check-ups. Severe cases may require surgery to repair or replace the valve.',

      summary: 'Mitral stenosis is graded by valve area with rheumatic disease as the primary cause; mitral regurgitation is classified as primary (organic valve disease) or secondary (functional, from LV dilation), with echocardiographic severity grading guiding the timing of surgical repair or replacement.',
      explanation: 'Mitral stenosis (MS) severity is graded by mitral valve area: mild MS has a valve area of 1.5-2.5 cm2 (normal is 4-6 cm2), moderate MS is 1.0-1.5 cm2, and severe MS is less than 1.0 cm2. The mean transmitral gradient increases with severity (severe is greater than 10 mmHg). Rheumatic heart disease causes approximately 99% of MS worldwide, resulting from autoimmune damage to the valve following Group A streptococcal infection. The pathologic hallmark is commissural fusion with leaflet thickening and chordal shortening. Symptoms develop gradually as the narrowed valve creates elevated left atrial pressure, which transmits to the pulmonary veins causing dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Left atrial dilation predisposes to atrial fibrillation, and the combination of AF and MS significantly increases stroke risk (requiring anticoagulation). Auscultation reveals a low-pitched diastolic rumble best heard at the apex with the bell of the stethoscope, preceded by an opening snap. The S1 is loud when the valve is still mobile. A shorter opening snap-to-S2 interval indicates more severe stenosis (higher LA pressure opens the valve earlier). Mitral regurgitation (MR) is classified as primary (degenerative) or secondary (functional). Primary MR results from intrinsic valve pathology: myxomatous degeneration (the most common cause in developed countries), rheumatic disease, endocarditis, or connective tissue disorders (Marfan, Ehlers-Danlos). Secondary MR results from left ventricular dilation or dysfunction that displaces the papillary muscles and tethers the leaflets, preventing proper coaptation. This distinction is critical because primary MR is treated with valve surgery (repair preferred over replacement), while secondary MR is initially managed by treating the underlying heart failure. Severe primary MR is defined by EROA greater than 0.40 cm2, regurgitant volume greater than 60 mL, or regurgitant fraction greater than 50%. The threshold for secondary MR is lower (EROA greater than 0.20 cm2). The murmur of MR is a holosystolic (pansystolic) blowing murmur at the apex, radiating to the axilla. Mitral valve prolapse produces a mid-systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur. Standing and Valsalva maneuver move the click earlier and make the murmur longer, while squatting delays the click.',

Secondary MR is treated by optimizing heart failure medical therapy first (GDMT including ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, and CRT if indicated).'

      summary: 'Advanced mitral valve disease management integrates 3D echocardiographic assessment, percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty for rheumatic MS, surgical repair techniques versus replacement, and transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (MitraClip) for high-risk patients with MR.',
      explanation: 'Advanced imaging for mitral valve disease centers on transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), particularly 3D TEE, which provides en face views of the mitral valve apparatus essential for surgical planning. The Carpentier classification describes the mechanism of MR: Type I has normal leaflet motion with annular dilation (functional MR) or leaflet perforation (endocarditis); Type II has excessive leaflet motion (prolapse or flail due to chordal elongation or rupture); Type III has restricted leaflet motion, either in diastole (IIIa, rheumatic) or systole (IIIb, ischemic/functional). This classification directly guides surgical repair technique. For mitral stenosis, percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is the preferred intervention for suitable patients. The Wilkins echocardiographic scoring system (also called the Massachusetts General Hospital score) grades four features: leaflet mobility, leaflet thickening, subvalvular thickening, and calcification, each on a 0-4 scale (total 0-16). Patients with scores of 8 or less have excellent outcomes with PBMV. Contraindications include moderate-to-severe MR, left atrial thrombus, and scores greater than 8. PBMV achieves immediate doubling of valve area in most cases. Surgical mitral valve repair is preferred over replacement for primary MR because it preserves the native valve, maintains the annular-papillary muscle continuity essential for LV function, avoids lifelong anticoagulation, and has lower operative mortality. Standard repair techniques include: triangular or quadrangular resection of the prolapsing segment, neo-chordae placement using Gore-Tex (ePTFE) sutures, sliding plasty for posterior leaflet excess tissue, and annuloplasty ring placement (virtually always performed). Durability of mitral repair for degenerative disease is excellent: freedom from reoperation exceeds 90% at 20 years in experienced centers. For secondary MR, the role of surgery is more controversial. Undersized annuloplasty ring can reduce secondary MR, but high recurrence rates (30-60% at 2 years) have tempered enthusiasm. The CTSN trials showed that mitral repair was not superior to replacement for ischemic MR, with high recurrence in the repair group. Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) using the MitraClip device has emerged as an option for patients with prohibitive surgical risk. The device clips the anterior and posterior leaflets together, mimicking the surgical Alfieri stitch. The EVEREST II trial demonstrated safety and feasibility. The pivotal COAPT trial showed dramatic reduction in heart failure hospitalization and mortality (29.1% vs. 46.1% at 2 years) when MitraClip was added to GDMT in carefully selected patients with secondary MR (EROA greater than 0.30 cm2, LV not excessively dilated with LVESD less than 70 mm). In contrast, the MITRA-FR trial showed no benefit, likely because patients had more advanced/dilated ventricles with proportionate MR. The concept of disproportionate MR (MR severity out of proportion to LV dilation, as in COAPT) versus proportionate MR (MR expected for the degree of LV dilation, as in MITRA-FR) helps reconcile these results.',

MITRA-FR enrolled patients with less severe MR relative to LV dilation. The practical implication: MitraClip benefits patients with "disproportionate" MR where the valve disease is driving symptoms beyond what the LV dysfunction alone would explain.'

      summary: 'Advanced mitral valve management encompasses complex repair strategies for Barlow disease and bileaflet prolapse, catheter-based interventions beyond MitraClip, mitral annular calcification management, and integration of cardiac CT and CMR for procedural planning.',
      explanation: 'Complex mitral repair scenarios require advanced surgical expertise. Barlow disease presents with bileaflet prolapse, excessive leaflet tissue (billowing), and annular dilation. Repair strategies include: multiple resections, extensive chordal replacement with ePTFE neo-chordae, commissuroplasty, and large annuloplasty rings. The "respect rather than resect" philosophy has shifted toward preserving leaflet tissue using artificial chordae rather than resecting excess tissue, which may improve long-term durability. For anterior leaflet prolapse (more challenging than posterior), primary chordal replacement with ePTFE sutures is the preferred technique. The "loop technique" using pre-measured ePTFE loops simplifies chordal replacement. Minimally invasive mitral surgery through right mini-thoracotomy with robotic assistance has achieved comparable outcomes to conventional sternotomy in high-volume centers, with faster recovery. Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is an increasingly recognized entity that complicates both surgical and transcatheter intervention. Severe MAC creates a rigid, calcified annulus that prevents standard annuloplasty ring placement and increases the risk of atrioventricular groove disruption during surgery. Options include: decalcification with patch reconstruction (high risk), transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) in MAC using balloon-expandable TAVR valves placed in the mitral position (off-label, technically challenging), or dedicated TMVI devices. Transcatheter mitral interventions beyond TEER are rapidly evolving. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) devices (Tendyne, Evoque, Intrepid) aim to treat both stenosis and regurgitation. Challenges include: large delivery systems, risk of LVOT obstruction (the anterior mitral leaflet can be pushed toward the septum by the prosthesis), and paravalvular leak around an irregular, non-circular annulus. LVOT obstruction risk is assessed by pre-procedural CT measuring the neo-LVOT area (area between the prosthesis and the septum, with less than 200 mm2 considered high risk). Techniques to mitigate include anterior leaflet laceration (LAMPOON procedure) or alcohol septal ablation. Indirect annuloplasty devices (Carillon, Cardioband) aim to reduce annular dimensions percutaneously. The Carillon device is placed in the coronary sinus (which runs along the posterior mitral annulus) and cinched to reduce the anteroposterior annular dimension. Cardioband is a transcatheter direct annuloplasty device that anchors along the posterior annulus and is cinched under echocardiographic guidance. Cardiac CT plays an expanding role in mitral valve disease assessment: measurement of mitral annular dimensions and dynamics through the cardiac cycle, assessment of papillary muscle anatomy, neo-LVOT prediction for TMVR planning, and coronary artery proximity to the annulus (circumflex artery risk). CMR provides gold-standard quantification of mitral regurgitant volume (indirect method using LV stroke volume minus aortic forward flow) and LV volumes/function for surgical timing.',

For secondary MR, the COAPT criteria should be applied (EROA >=30 mm2, LVESD <70 mm, on maximally tolerated GDMT). Multi-disciplinary heart team evaluation integrating echocardiography, CT, and clinical assessment is essential.'

      summary: 'Expert mitral valve disease management integrates advanced hemodynamic exercise testing, molecular mechanisms of myxomatous degeneration, emerging transcatheter platforms, arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse risk stratification, and precision imaging for procedural guidance.',
      explanation: 'The molecular pathogenesis of myxomatous mitral valve degeneration involves disruption of the extracellular matrix. TGF-beta signaling pathway dysregulation drives excessive proteoglycan and glycosaminoglycan accumulation in the spongiosa layer, with degradation of collagen and elastin in the fibrosa layer. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-13) are upregulated, while tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are relatively deficient. Genetic studies have identified several loci: FLNA (filamin A, X-linked MVP), DCHS1, DZIP1, and TNS1. Marfan syndrome (FBN1), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (COL5A1/2, COL3A1), and Loeys-Dietz syndrome (TGFBR1/2) represent syndromic causes of MVP with more aggressive mitral involvement. Arrhythmic mitral valve prolapse (AMVP) has emerged as an important entity linking MVP to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. While overall SCD risk in MVP is very low, a subset of patients (particularly young women with bileaflet prolapse) has increased risk. Risk features include: bileaflet involvement, Barlow morphology, mitral annular disjunction (MAD, separation of the leaflet hinge point from the ventricular myocardium), curling or flipping of the posterior leaflet, and fibrosis of the papillary muscles and inferobasal wall on CMR (LGE). The mechanism involves stretch-mediated fibrosis from the prolapsing leaflets creating an arrhythmogenic substrate. PVCs originating from the papillary muscles or Purkinje system are typical. Risk stratification uses: 24-hour Holter (frequent PVCs, complex ectopy, non-sustained VT), CMR with LGE (papillary muscle and inferobasal wall fibrosis), and echocardiographic features (MAD, Pickelhaube sign on tissue Doppler showing a sharp systolic spike at the mitral annulus). Management of high-risk AMVP patients includes beta-blockers, catheter ablation of PVC foci, and in selected cases ICD implantation, though evidence-based guidelines are still evolving. Exercise hemodynamics have become critical for decision-making in moderate MR. Exercise echocardiography can unmask severe MR during exertion (exercise-induced increase in EROA, pulmonary artery systolic pressure exceeding 60 mmHg with exercise). This may identify patients who would benefit from earlier intervention despite apparently moderate resting MR severity. For mitral stenosis, exercise hemodynamics similarly help: a mean mitral gradient exceeding 15 mmHg or PASP exceeding 60 mmHg with exercise supports intervention even when resting values are only moderate. Next-generation transcatheter mitral technologies under development include: (1) PASCAL TEER device (Edwards Lifesciences) with broader paddles and independent leaflet capture for complex MR anatomy; (2) Tendyne TMVR with tethered epicardial pad for secure anchoring; (3) Evoque TMVR with transseptal delivery and anchoring mechanisms designed for the mitral position; (4) Harpoon device for beating-heart transapical chordal implantation without cardiopulmonary bypass; (5) NeoChord device for similar off-pump neo-chordae implantation via left mini-thoracotomy; (6) Mitral spacer devices (Mitra-Spacer) occupying the regurgitant orifice. The concept of "precision mitral intervention" is emerging, using pre-procedural computational modeling (finite element analysis of the mitral valve apparatus) to simulate repair strategies and predict outcomes before the actual procedure. Patient-specific 3D-printed models from CT and echocardiographic data are used for pre-procedural planning and proceduralist training.',

If high-risk features are present, aggressive arrhythmia management (beta-blockers, PVC ablation) and consideration of ICD should be discussed, even if LV function is preserved and MR is only moderate.'
