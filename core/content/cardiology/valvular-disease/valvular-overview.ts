      summary: 'Valvular heart disease occurs when one or more of the heart\'s four valves do not work properly, either by becoming too narrow (stenosis) or leaking (regurgitation), which can eventually strain the heart.',
      explanation: 'The heart has four valves that act like one-way doors, keeping blood flowing in the correct direction through the heart. The four valves are: the mitral valve (between the left atrium and left ventricle), the aortic valve (between the left ventricle and the aorta), the tricuspid valve (between the right atrium and right ventricle), and the pulmonic valve (between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery). Each valve opens to let blood flow forward and closes tightly to prevent blood from flowing backward. Two main problems can affect heart valves. Stenosis means the valve becomes narrowed and stiff, like a door that will not open fully. The heart has to work harder to push blood through the narrow opening. Regurgitation (also called insufficiency or incompetence) means the valve does not close properly, like a door that will not shut completely, allowing blood to leak backward. Some people are born with valve problems (congenital), while others develop them later in life from conditions such as age-related wear and tear, infections, rheumatic fever, or heart attacks. Heart valve disease is very common, affecting approximately 2.5% of the general population, with prevalence increasing significantly with age. Many people with mild valve disease have no symptoms and live normal lives. When valve disease becomes severe, symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, dizziness, or fainting may develop. Doctors detect valve disease by listening to the heart with a stethoscope (hearing a murmur) and confirm it with an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart). Treatment ranges from regular monitoring for mild cases to medications for symptom management and surgery or catheter-based procedures for severe cases.',

      clinicalNotes: 'All patients with a newly detected heart murmur should have an echocardiogram to determine the cause and severity. Most incidentally discovered murmurs are benign (flow murmurs), but systematic evaluation ensures that significant valvular disease is not missed. The intensity of a murmur does not always correlate with disease severity.'

      summary: 'Valvular heart disease is evaluated using echocardiography to grade severity as mild, moderate, or severe. Left-sided valve diseases (aortic and mitral) are more clinically significant. Management follows guidelines-based timing for intervention depending on symptoms and cardiac function.',
      explanation: 'Echocardiography is the cornerstone diagnostic tool for valvular heart disease. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) assesses valve anatomy, hemodynamic severity (gradients, velocities, valve areas), and the impact on cardiac chambers and function. Severity is graded as mild, moderate, or severe using standardized criteria from the ASE/ACC/AHA guidelines. Key parameters differ by valve and lesion type. For stenotic lesions, severity is determined by valve area, mean gradient, and peak velocity. For regurgitant lesions, severity depends on regurgitant volume, regurgitant fraction, effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA), and vena contracta width. Left-sided valve disease (aortic and mitral) is more common and clinically impactful than right-sided disease because the left heart operates at higher pressures. The four most clinically important lesions are aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. Aortic stenosis is the most common valve disease in developed countries, primarily affecting elderly patients with degenerative calcification. Mitral regurgitation is the second most common, with degenerative (primary) and functional (secondary) forms. Mitral stenosis is predominantly caused by rheumatic heart disease and remains common in developing countries. Tricuspid regurgitation is increasingly recognized as clinically important, particularly in patients with left-sided heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. The etiology of valvular disease varies by geography. In developed nations, degenerative calcific disease and myxomatous degeneration predominate. Worldwide, rheumatic heart disease remains the leading cause, affecting an estimated 33 million people. Endocarditis can acutely damage any valve. The general principle for intervention timing is that surgery should be performed before irreversible ventricular dysfunction or pulmonary hypertension develops, but early enough to avoid the risks of surgery in patients who are still asymptomatic. Key triggers for intervention include symptom onset, declining LV function (ejection fraction), and chamber dilation beyond established thresholds. All patients with moderate or severe valvular disease require serial echocardiographic surveillance at intervals determined by severity and rate of progression.',

Severe MR every 6-12 months; moderate MR every 1-2 years. Patients should be instructed to report new symptoms promptly, as symptom onset is a key trigger for intervention regardless of scheduled follow-up timing.'

      summary: 'Comprehensive valvular heart disease management involves multimodality imaging for severity assessment, hemodynamic classification of mixed and multivalvular disease, evidence-based timing of intervention, and heart team-based selection between surgical and transcatheter approaches.',
      explanation: 'When echocardiographic assessment is inconclusive or discordant, additional modalities provide complementary information. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) offers superior resolution for mitral valve assessment, prosthetic valve evaluation, and endocarditis diagnosis. Cardiac MRI provides gold-standard ventricular volume and function assessment, accurate regurgitant volume quantification (particularly valuable when echo is discordant), and tissue characterization (myocardial fibrosis indicating decompensation). Cardiac CT provides aortic valve calcium scoring for confirming severe AS when echo is equivocal, annular sizing for TAVR planning, coronary assessment, and evaluation of prosthetic valve complications. Exercise testing is valuable in asymptomatic severe disease to unmask exercise-limited symptoms, assess hemodynamic response (exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension), and guide intervention timing. Stress echocardiography combines exercise with imaging to assess dynamic changes in valve hemodynamics. The concept of mixed valvular disease (e.g., combined AS and AR, or combined MS and MR) and multivalvular disease (simultaneous disease of multiple valves) adds complexity. In mixed disease, the predominant lesion determines management, but interactions occur: concurrent AR increases the gradient across a stenotic aortic valve, and concurrent MR reduces the gradient across a stenotic mitral valve. Multivalvular disease requires careful hemodynamic assessment because upstream lesions (e.g., MS) can mask the severity of downstream lesions (e.g., AS) by reducing flow. Current guidelines emphasize the heart team approach: a multidisciplinary team including interventional cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, imaging specialists, and heart failure specialists collaborates on management decisions for each patient. This is particularly important for complex scenarios: high-risk patients, multivalvular disease, concomitant coronary disease requiring CABG, and choice between surgical and transcatheter approaches. The 2020 ACC/AHA and 2021 ESC guidelines provide comprehensive frameworks. Key staging has been introduced: Stage A (at risk, no valve disease yet), Stage B (progressive, asymptomatic mild-moderate), Stage C (asymptomatic severe: C1 with preserved LV function, C2 with LV dysfunction), and Stage D (symptomatic severe). Intervention is generally indicated at Stage D, and selectively at Stage C2. The guidelines also recognize specific scenarios where intervention at Stage C1 may be reasonable (very severe AS, rapidly progressive disease, exercise intolerance on testing). Antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis is now limited to high-risk patients only: those with prosthetic valves, prior endocarditis, certain congenital heart diseases, and cardiac transplant recipients with valvulopathy.',

      summary: 'Advanced valvular heart disease management addresses prosthetic valve selection and complications, complex multivalvular interventions, anticoagulation strategies for mechanical valves, hemodynamic assessment of prosthetic valve dysfunction, and management during pregnancy.',
      explanation: 'Prosthetic valve selection is a critical decision. Mechanical valves (bileaflet tilting-disc: St. Jude, On-X; single-disc: Bjork-Shiley) offer excellent durability (lasting the patient\'s lifetime) but require lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin due to high thrombogenicity. Target INR varies by valve position: aortic 2.0-3.0, mitral 2.5-3.5. The On-X valve has received FDA approval for lower INR target (1.5-2.0) in the aortic position after 3 months. Bioprosthetic valves (porcine xenograft: Hancock, Carpentier-Edwards; bovine pericardial: Perimount) avoid long-term anticoagulation but undergo structural valve degeneration (SVD) with limited durability: 10-15 years in elderly patients, often less than 10 years in younger patients. The choice between mechanical and bioprosthetic valves considers patient age, anticoagulation risk/preference, lifestyle, and potential for future valve-in-valve TAVR. Current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend: mechanical valve is reasonable for patients under 50 for aortic position and under 65 for mitral position; bioprosthetic is reasonable over age 65 for aortic and over 70 for mitral; between these ages, either is appropriate based on shared decision-making. Prosthetic valve complications include: (1) Structural valve degeneration (bioprosthetic): progressive leaflet calcification, tearing, or stiffening causing stenosis or regurgitation. (2) Thrombosis: more common with mechanical valves but can occur with bioprosthetics. Obstructive valve thrombosis presents with acute heart failure; non-obstructive thrombosis may be subclinical. Fluoroscopy showing restricted leaflet motion and TEE are diagnostic. Treatment is thrombolysis (for right-sided or left-sided non-critically ill) or emergent surgery. (3) Pannus formation: fibrous tissue ingrowth that obstructs the valve orifice, more common with mechanical valves, distinguished from thrombus by CT (pannus is hypodense, thrombus enhances). (4) Paravalvular leak: regurgitation through the space between the sewing ring and native tissue. Small leaks are common and usually benign; large leaks cause hemolytic anemia and heart failure. (5) Endocarditis: prosthetic valve endocarditis has 20-40% in-hospital mortality. Valvular disease in pregnancy presents unique challenges. Stenotic lesions (particularly MS) are poorly tolerated because the increase in blood volume and heart rate of pregnancy increases gradients. The hypercoagulable state increases thrombotic risk with mechanical valves. Anticoagulation management requires careful planning: warfarin is most effective but crosses the placenta (embryopathy risk 4-10% in first trimester, fetal intracranial hemorrhage risk throughout). LMWH is safer for the fetus but has higher valve thrombosis rates. Current approaches include: warfarin throughout pregnancy if dose is 5 mg or less per day (lower embryopathy risk), LMWH in the first trimester with warfarin thereafter if dose exceeds 5 mg, or LMWH throughout (highest maternal thrombotic risk). Vaginal delivery is preferred for most patients with valvular disease. Cesarean section is reserved for obstetric indications or patients on warfarin within 2 weeks of delivery (to avoid fetal intracranial hemorrhage during labor).',

      clinicalNotes: 'For prosthetic valve assessment, always know the patient\'s valve type, size, and position. Normal Doppler velocities depend on valve type and size (reference tables exist). An increase in gradient of more than 50% from the baseline post-operative echocardiogram should prompt investigation for SVD, thrombosis, or pannus. Patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) occurs when the prosthetic valve effective orifice area is too small relative to the patient\'s body surface area (severe PPM: EOAi <0.65 cm2/m2 for aortic, <0.9 cm2/m2 for mitral).'

      summary: 'Expert valvular heart disease management encompasses population-level screening strategies, emerging transcatheter solutions for all four valves, biomarker-guided timing of intervention, durability science for prosthetic valves, and precision medicine approaches to valve disease prevention.',
      explanation: 'The global burden of valvular heart disease is substantial and evolving. In high-income countries, the aging population drives increasing degenerative valve disease prevalence (estimated 13% of people over 75 have moderate-to-severe VHD). In low- and middle-income countries, rheumatic heart disease remains a major public health challenge, with an estimated 33 million affected and 300,000 deaths annually. Screening strategies differ: in endemic regions, echocardiographic screening of schoolchildren detects subclinical rheumatic heart disease at 10 times the rate of clinical screening alone, enabling secondary prophylaxis with penicillin to prevent disease progression. In developed countries, the role of population screening for degenerative VHD is debated, though incidental detection during cardiac imaging for other indications is common. Biomarker-guided intervention timing is an emerging concept. Elevated BNP and NT-proBNP in asymptomatic severe AS correlate with symptom onset and adverse outcomes, potentially identifying patients who would benefit from earlier intervention. High-sensitivity troponin elevation in asymptomatic severe AS suggests subclinical myocardial injury and has been associated with worse prognosis. Galectin-3 and ST2 as markers of myocardial fibrosis may predict irreversible ventricular remodeling, helping to identify the optimal "window" for intervention before fibrotic changes become permanent. GDF-15 (growth differentiation factor 15) is emerging as a prognostic marker across multiple valve lesions. The transcatheter revolution is extending beyond the aortic valve. Transcatheter mitral interventions (TEER, TMVR, annuloplasty devices) are discussed in detail in the mitral valve module. Transcatheter tricuspid interventions are rapidly developing: TEER for the tricuspid (TriClip/PASCAL, based on the TRILUMINATE trial), dedicated tricuspid replacement devices (EVOQUE, GATE), and heterotopic caval valve implantation (TricValve) for patients with severe TR and limited options. Transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (Melody valve, SAPIEN) is established for patients with congenital heart disease and dysfunctional RV-PA conduits. Valve durability science is advancing. Understanding of bioprosthetic valve degeneration mechanisms includes: (1) calcification driven by glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue (cross-linking preserves tissue but creates calcium-binding sites); (2) lipid insudation similar to atherosclerosis; (3) immune-mediated degeneration (anti-Gal antibodies against alpha-Gal epitopes on xenograft tissue). Anti-calcification treatments (alpha-amino oleic acid, ethanol, surfactant washing) and tissue engineering approaches (decellularized scaffolds, genetically modified pigs lacking alpha-Gal epitopes) aim to improve durability. Dry-stored tissue (RESILIA technology) shows promising early results. Mechanical valve design continues to evolve: carbon coating, hemodynamic optimization, and the On-X low-INR concept may broaden mechanical valve applicability. Artificial intelligence applications in valvular disease include: automated echocardiographic grading of valve disease severity, automated murmur detection using digital stethoscopes (potential for population screening), prediction of disease progression using machine learning, and optimization of TAVR sizing and positioning through computational modeling. The concept of "preventive valvular cardiology" is emerging, targeting the molecular mechanisms of valve degeneration before clinical disease develops. Lp(a) reduction for aortic stenosis prevention, anti-inflammatory therapies for post-rheumatic valve disease, and genetic screening for familial valve disease are all active areas of investigation.',

The heart team model will become even more important as the therapeutic landscape expands.'
