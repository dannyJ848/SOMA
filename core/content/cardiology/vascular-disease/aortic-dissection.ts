      summary: 'Aortic dissection is a life-threatening emergency in which the inner layer of the aorta tears, allowing blood to flow between the layers of the aortic wall, potentially leading to rupture or organ damage.',
      explanation: 'The aorta, the body\'s largest artery, has three layers in its wall: an inner layer (intima), a middle layer (media), and an outer layer (adventitia). In an aortic dissection, a tear develops in the inner layer, and blood surges through this tear into the middle layer, splitting (dissecting) the layers apart. This creates a "false channel" (false lumen) alongside the normal blood channel (true lumen). The blood flowing in this false channel can block blood supply to vital organs (brain, kidneys, intestines, legs), cause the aorta to rupture, or damage the aortic valve. Aortic dissection is a medical emergency. The most common symptom is sudden, severe chest or back pain, often described as "tearing" or "ripping" in quality. The pain may start in the chest and move to the back as the dissection extends. Without treatment, about half of patients with dissection involving the ascending aorta (the part closest to the heart) die within 48 hours. Risk factors include high blood pressure (the most important risk factor, present in about 70% of cases), age over 60, male sex, connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan syndrome), and bicuspid aortic valve. Diagnosis is confirmed with CT angiography (the fastest and most widely available test) or TEE. Treatment depends on the location: dissections involving the ascending aorta require emergency surgery to replace the torn section, while dissections limited to the descending aorta are initially treated with aggressive blood pressure control using intravenous medications.',

      summary: 'Aortic dissection is classified by the Stanford system (Type A involves the ascending aorta requiring surgery; Type B involves only the descending aorta, treated medically unless complicated) and DeBakey system. Diagnosis uses CTA, and management prioritizes blood pressure control and heart rate reduction.',
      explanation: 'Two classification systems are used for aortic dissection. The Stanford classification is simpler and guides management: Type A involves the ascending aorta (regardless of where the tear originates) and requires emergency surgery; Type B involves only the descending aorta (distal to the left subclavian artery) and is initially treated medically. The DeBakey classification is more anatomically detailed: Type I has the tear in the ascending aorta with dissection extending to the descending aorta; Type II is limited to the ascending aorta; Type III originates in the descending aorta (IIIa is limited to the thoracic aorta, IIIb extends into the abdominal aorta). Stanford Type A encompasses DeBakey Types I and II; Stanford Type B corresponds to DeBakey Type III. Approximately 60-65% of dissections are Type A and 35-40% are Type B. The clinical presentation includes sudden severe chest pain (85% of Type A) or back/interscapular pain (more common in Type B). The pain is classically "tearing" or "ripping" and maximal at onset (in contrast to MI pain which builds gradually). Physical examination may reveal a blood pressure differential between arms, new aortic regurgitation murmur (Type A involving the aortic root), neurological deficits from carotid involvement, or pulse deficits in the extremities. D-dimer is elevated in nearly all acute dissections (greater than 500 ng/mL) and has high sensitivity but low specificity; a normal D-dimer may help rule out dissection in low-risk patients. CT angiography (CTA) is the diagnostic test of choice: sensitivity and specificity both exceed 95%. It shows the intimal flap separating true and false lumens, extent of dissection, branch vessel involvement, and complications. TEE is an alternative when CTA is not feasible (unstable patients who cannot go to the scanner). MRI has the highest accuracy but is rarely used acutely due to time constraints. Initial medical management for all dissections focuses on reducing aortic wall shear stress by controlling both heart rate and blood pressure. First-line treatment is IV beta-blockers (esmolol or labetalol) targeting heart rate less than 60 bpm and systolic BP less than 120 mmHg. If additional BP reduction is needed after beta-blockade, IV vasodilators (nitroprusside, nicardipine, or clevidipine) are added. Vasodilators should not be used without prior beta-blockade, as they can cause reflex tachycardia that increases aortic wall stress. Type A dissection requires emergency surgery (ascending aortic replacement, with aortic root repair or replacement and arch repair as needed). Surgical mortality for Type A repair is approximately 10-25%. Uncomplicated Type B dissection is managed with optimal medical therapy. Complicated Type B dissection (malperfusion of organs, rapid aortic expansion, rupture, refractory pain, or uncontrolled hypertension) requires intervention, typically thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).',

If the patient has contraindications to beta-blockers (severe asthma, decompensated HF), use IV diltiazem or verapamil as an alternative.'

      summary: 'Aortic dissection pathophysiology involves medial degeneration with intimal tear propagation driven by hemodynamic forces. Management of Type A requires emergency surgery with decisions about root, arch, and frozen elephant trunk approaches. Complicated Type B benefits from TEVAR with growing evidence for preemptive treatment of uncomplicated Type B.',
      explanation: 'The pathophysiology begins with degeneration of the aortic media, particularly loss of smooth muscle cells and fragmentation of elastic fibers (cystic medial degeneration). Hypertension accelerates this process through chronic hemodynamic stress. When an intimal tear occurs, blood enters the media at arterial pressure, creating the false lumen. The dissection propagates in an antegrade (downstream) and sometimes retrograde direction, driven by the pulsatile blood flow (dP/dt, the rate of pressure rise). The false lumen can compress the true lumen (causing malperfusion), occlude branch vessels either by direct extension of the flap into the branch (static malperfusion) or by the pressurized false lumen compressing the true lumen at the branch orifice (dynamic malperfusion), rupture through the adventitia (causing hemopericardium in Type A or hemothorax in Type B), and extend into the aortic root causing aortic regurgitation or coronary malperfusion. Surgical management of Type A dissection involves replacement of the ascending aorta with a Dacron tube graft. Additional procedures depend on the extent of involvement: if the aortic root is involved, valve-sparing root replacement (David procedure) or Bentall procedure is performed; if the coronary ostia are involved, reimplantation or bypass grafting is required; if the aortic arch is involved, options range from hemiarch replacement (the most common, replacing only the inner curve of the arch) to total arch replacement with reimplantation of the arch vessels. The frozen elephant trunk (FET) technique combines total arch replacement with a stent-graft that extends into the proximal descending aorta, treating both the arch and proximal descending aorta in a single operation. This is particularly useful when the tear extends into the descending aorta. Hypothermic circulatory arrest (HCA) is required for arch surgery. Brain protection strategies include deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA, core temperature 18-20 degrees Celsius, safe arrest time approximately 30 minutes), moderate HCA with antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP, unilateral or bilateral, the most common modern approach), or retrograde cerebral perfusion. For Type B dissection, the INSTEAD-XL trial demonstrated that preemptive TEVAR in uncomplicated Type B dissection (performed within 2 weeks to 3 months) improved 5-year survival and aortic remodeling compared to optimal medical therapy alone. This has shifted the paradigm toward considering TEVAR in anatomically high-risk uncomplicated Type B dissections (those with a large false lumen, partial false lumen thrombosis, entry tear greater than 10 mm, or total aortic diameter greater than 40 mm at presentation). TEVAR for dissection involves covering the primary entry tear with a stent-graft, which promotes false lumen thrombosis and aortic remodeling. The PETTICOAT technique (provisional extension to induce complete attachment) combines a proximal covered stent-graft with distal bare metal stents to re-expand the true lumen throughout the thoracoabdominal aorta.',

If root is normal, preserve it. (2) Arch: if the tear does not extend into the arch, hemiarch is sufficient. If there is a large arch tear or aneurysm, total arch replacement with FET should be considered. (3) Coronary involvement requires reimplantation or bypass. Decision-making must balance repair completeness against operative time and patient condition.'

      summary: 'Advanced dissection management encompasses endovascular strategies for malperfusion syndromes, management of chronic dissection and aneurysmal degeneration, intramural hematoma and penetrating aortic ulcer as aortic dissection variants, and organ-specific malperfusion protocols.',
      explanation: 'Malperfusion syndromes complicate 25-30% of acute Type A and Type B dissections and are the primary drivers of morbidity and mortality. Organ-specific malperfusion presentations include: (1) Cerebral malperfusion (7-10%): stroke from carotid or vertebral artery involvement. In Type A dissection, some centers advocate for immediate ascending aortic repair even after stroke, as restoration of true lumen flow may salvage penumbral tissue. (2) Coronary malperfusion (5-10%): acute MI, most commonly from right coronary artery involvement (the RCA ostium is closer to the false lumen). Presentation may mimic STEMI, leading to diagnostic confusion. Coronary angiography in dissection is dangerous (risk of catheterizing the false lumen). (3) Mesenteric malperfusion (5-10%): intestinal ischemia with lactate elevation, abdominal pain, and high mortality (60-80%). Management requires urgent restoration of mesenteric flow through TEVAR and/or fenestration/stenting of the SMA. (4) Renal malperfusion (10-20%): acute kidney injury, which may require stenting of the renal artery ostia. (5) Limb malperfusion (15-20%): pulse deficits, typically managed with femoral artery fenestration or extra-anatomic bypass. The contemporary approach to malperfusion in Type A dissection follows two strategies: the "aortic-first" approach (emergency ascending replacement, which often restores true lumen flow and resolves malperfusion) versus the "malperfusion-first" approach (endovascular fenestration and stenting to restore organ perfusion before ascending repair). The Michigan experience with malperfusion-first has shown improved outcomes for mesenteric and limb malperfusion, as delayed restoration of organ perfusion during lengthy cardiac surgery increases ischemia time. Acute aortic syndromes also include intramural hematoma (IMH) and penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer (PAU). IMH is hemorrhage within the aortic media without an identifiable intimal tear, likely from vasa vasorum rupture. It appears as crescentic thickening of the aortic wall (greater than 5 mm) without blood flow on imaging. Type A IMH is treated surgically (similar to Type A dissection, with 30-40% progression rate). Type B IMH is managed medically with close surveillance; approximately 10% progress to dissection. Aortic wall thickness greater than 11 mm, maximum aortic diameter greater than 48 mm, and recurrent pain predict progression. PAU is ulceration through the intimal plaque into the media, typically in elderly patients with extensive atherosclerosis. Most PAUs are in the descending aorta. Complications include IMH, pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or rupture. TEVAR is recommended for complicated PAU (enlarging pseudoaneurysm, recurrent symptoms, rapid growth). Chronic aortic dissection (surviving more than 14 days) presents ongoing management challenges. The dissected aorta undergoes aneurysmal degeneration in 20-40% of patients over 5 years due to persistent false lumen pressurization. Risk factors for late aneurysmal degeneration include: initial aortic diameter greater than 40 mm, patent false lumen (worst prognosis), partial false lumen thrombosis (intermediate, paradoxically higher risk than fully patent), large entry tear, and uncontrolled hypertension. Surveillance with annual CT angiography is required lifelong. Intervention for chronic dissection aneurysm (generally at 5.5-6.0 cm) is technically more challenging than acute repair due to adhesions, chronic false lumen organization, and intercostal artery dependence.',

      clinicalNotes: 'In acute Type A dissection with malperfusion, the key clinical decision is whether to proceed with immediate ascending repair (aortic-first) or address malperfusion endovascularly first (malperfusion-first). General guidance: cerebral and coronary malperfusion are addressed with ascending repair (aortic-first). Mesenteric malperfusion may benefit from a malperfusion-first approach, as intestinal ischemia time during prolonged cardiac surgery is poorly tolerated. Limb malperfusion is least urgent and often resolves with ascending repair. This decision requires institutional expertise and multidisciplinary team coordination.'

      summary: 'Expert aortic dissection management integrates genomic risk stratification, advanced imaging biomarkers for false lumen remodeling prediction, computational flow modeling, novel endovascular platforms for arch dissection, and long-term outcomes optimization in chronic dissection.',
      explanation: 'The genetic architecture of aortic dissection extends beyond classic connective tissue disorders. Familial non-syndromic thoracic aortic dissection accounts for 20% of cases and involves: ACTA2 (smooth muscle alpha-actin, the most common non-syndromic gene, 12-21% of familial TAAD), MYH11 (smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, associated with PDA), SMAD3, TGFB2, LOX (lysyl oxidase), PRKG1 (an activating mutation with mean dissection age of 18 years), MFAP5, and MAT2A. Multigene panel testing is recommended for patients with dissection under age 60, family history of aortic disease, or clinical features of connective tissue disorders. The concept of the "aortic genome clinic" integrates genetic testing, cascade screening, genotype-specific surveillance protocols, and activity counseling. Advanced imaging biomarkers predict false lumen behavior in Type B dissection. 4D flow MRI quantifies hemodynamic parameters within the false lumen: elevated false lumen flow velocity, presence of vortical flow patterns, and high wall shear stress in the false lumen predict persistent patency and aneurysmal degeneration. Conversely, stagnant false lumen flow predicts thrombosis. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applied to patient-specific CT angiography data can model pressure differentials between true and false lumens, predict re-entry tear locations, and simulate the hemodynamic effects of endograft placement before intervention. These tools are moving toward clinical application for personalized treatment planning. The timing of TEVAR for uncomplicated Type B dissection is evolving. The ADSORB trial and INSTEAD-XL data support intervention in the subacute phase (14 days to 3 months), when the dissected aortic wall is inflamed and the tissue can still remodel. Beyond 3 months, chronic inflammatory changes and fibrosis reduce the potential for aortic remodeling. The optimal timing may be as early as 1-2 weeks for anatomically high-risk dissections. Novel endovascular approaches for Type A and arch dissection are challenging the paradigm that all Type A dissections require open surgery. Ascending aortic endovascular repair is under investigation with dedicated ascending stent-grafts (NEXUS, ASEND trials). These face unique challenges: the ascending aorta is curved, mobile with each heartbeat, and close to the coronary ostia and aortic valve. The STABILISE technique (stent-assisted balloon-induced intimal disruption and relamination in aortic dissection) uses intentional rupture of the dissection flap with balloon dilation to eliminate the false lumen throughout the thoracoabdominal aorta, combined with bare metal stenting. Early results are promising for achieving complete aortic remodeling. Connective tissue disorder-specific management nuances: vEDS (COL3A1) patients should ideally be managed medically when possible, as surgical outcomes are poor due to tissue fragility (operative mortality 40-50%); celiprolol has shown mortality reduction. Loeys-Dietz patients have more diffuse vascular involvement requiring pan-aortic surveillance and may develop dissections at smaller diameters than Marfan patients. The HTAD gene-specific surgical thresholds (per 2022 ACC/AHA guidelines) range from 4.0 cm (PRKG1, TGFBR1/2 with certain features) to 5.0 cm (isolated SMAD3). Long-term optimization for chronic dissection survivors includes: lifelong beta-blocker therapy (target heart rate less than 60 bpm), aggressive BP control (target less than 120/80 mmHg), annual CT surveillance, activity restrictions (avoiding isometric exercise, contact sports, heavy lifting), and genetic counseling with family screening. The 10-year survival after acute Type A repair is approximately 55-70%, with 30% requiring reintervention on the residual dissected aorta.',
