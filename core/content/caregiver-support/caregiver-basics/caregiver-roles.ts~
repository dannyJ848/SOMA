- Gender differences in role expectations
- Generational differences

*Role Captivity (Aneshensel et al.)*
- Feeling trapped in unwanted role
- Associated with depression, burden
- Mediated by relationship quality
- Moderated by perceived choice

*Role Engulfment*
- Loss of self-identity beyond caregiving
- Associated with negative outcomes
- Protective factors: maintaining employment, social connections

## Assessment of Caregiver Roles

**Caregiver Vigilance Scale**
Measures:
- Watching (monitoring care recipient)
- Being on duty (24/7 responsibility sense)
- Protective caregiving (preventing harm)
- Anticipatory caregiving (planning ahead)

**Family Caregiving Inventory**
Domains:
- Personal care tasks
- Nursing care tasks
- Coordination tasks
- Emotional support tasks
- Supervision tasks

**Preparedness for Caregiving Scale**
Assesses perceived readiness for:
- Physical care
- Emotional support
- Setting up services
- Dealing with stress

## Clinical Task Complexity Analysis

**Medication Management Complexity**
*Simple*: Single medication, routine schedule
*Moderate*: Multiple medications, timed administration
*Complex*: Injections, titration, PRN decisions
*Very Complex*: IV medications, multiple routes, interactions

**Assessment Skills Required**

- Symptom recognition (when to escalate)
- Mental status monitoring (delirium, depression)
- Skin integrity assessment (pressure injury risk)

**Procedural Skills Required**
