**Why Have Family Meetings**

- Reduce misunderstandings

**Who Should Be There**

- The person being cared for (if able)
- Spouses and partners
- Anyone who helps with care
- Sometimes a professional (social worker, mediator)

**How to Plan a Meeting**
- Choose a good time for everyone
- Set a time limit (1-2 hours)
- Create a list of topics to discuss
- Ask someone to lead the meeting
- Consider video call for distant family

**During the Meeting**
- Let everyone speak without interrupting
- Focus on the care recipient\"s needs
- Be respectful even when disagreeing
- Write down what is decided
- Assign specific tasks to specific people

**Tips for Success**
- Stay calm and patient
- Listen to understand, not just to reply
- Focus on solutions, not blame
- Take breaks if things get heated
- Remember you are on the same team`,
