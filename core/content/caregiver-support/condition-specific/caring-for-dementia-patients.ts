        "Caring for someone with dementia means helping a person whose brain disease affects their memory, thinking, and behavior.",
      explanation: `Dementia is a brain disease that makes it hard for people to remember things, think clearly, and sometimes act the way they used to. It is not a normal part of getting older.

**What Happens with Dementia**
- Forgetting recent events or conversations
- Getting confused about time or place
- Difficulty finding the right words
- Trouble doing familiar tasks
- Changes in mood or personality
- Sometimes seeing or believing things that are not real

**How You Can Help**

**Be Patient and Kind**
- Do not argue or correct them harshly
- Stay calm even when things are frustrating
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Give one instruction at a time

**Keep Things Simple**
- Stick to daily routines
- Keep the home organized
- Label drawers and rooms
- Reduce noise and distractions

**Keep Them Safe**
- Remove tripping hazards
- Lock up dangerous items
- Use door alarms if they wander
- Supervise cooking and bathing

**Help Them Feel Good**
- Look at old photos together
- Play familiar music
- Do simple activities they enjoy
- Spend quality time together

**Take Care of Yourself**
Caring for someone with dementia is very hard. Make sure you:
- Get help from others
- Take breaks
- Join a support group
- Talk about your feelings`,

      explanation: `**Understanding Dementia**

Dementia is not one disease but a group of conditions that affect the brain:
- **Alzheimer\"s disease**: Most common, affects memory first
- **Vascular dementia**: Caused by strokes or blood vessel problems
- **Lewy body dementia**: Includes visual hallucinations
- **Frontotemporal dementia**: Affects personality and behavior first

**Stages of Dementia**

| Stage | Changes | Care Needs |
|-------|---------|------------|
| Early | Mild memory loss, word-finding difficulty | Support, reminders, safety planning |
| Middle | Increased confusion, behavior changes, help with ADLs | More hands-on care, supervision |
| Late | Severe memory loss, physical decline | Full assistance, comfort care |

**Communication Strategies**

**Do**
- Make eye contact
- Use simple, short sentences
- Speak calmly and slowly
- Use gestures to help
- Give time to respond
- Focus on feelings, not facts
- Offer choices (limit to two options)

**Avoid**
- Arguing or correcting
- Asking "do you remember?"
- Speaking about them as if not there
- Using "baby talk"
- Rushing or showing frustration

**Managing Challenging Behaviors**

**Agitation**
- Identify triggers (pain, hunger, overstimulation)
- Stay calm and reassuring
- Redirect to a calming activity
- Reduce environmental stressors

**Wandering**
- Ensure safe walking areas
- Use identification bracelet
- Install door alarms
- Engage in supervised walking

**Sundowning** (increased confusion in evening)
- Keep afternoons calm
- Increase lighting as sun sets

- Redirect to an activity
- Post written answers if helpful
- Address underlying anxiety

**Daily Care Approaches**

- Break tasks into simple steps
- Allow extra time
- Provide cues and prompts
- Celebrate successes`,
