        "Caring for a stroke survivor means helping with recovery, managing new disabilities, and preventing another stroke.",
      explanation: `A stroke happens when blood flow to the brain is blocked or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. This can cause lasting changes in how someone moves, talks, thinks, or feels.

**Common Effects of Stroke**
- Weakness or paralysis on one side
- Trouble speaking or understanding
- Problems swallowing
- Memory and thinking changes
- Emotional changes (depression, anxiety)
- Vision problems

**How You Can Help**

**Physical Recovery**
- Help with exercises from therapy
- Assist with walking and moving
- Help them use any needed equipment
- Be patient as they relearn skills

**Communication Help**
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Give them time to respond
- Use simple sentences
- Try gestures or writing if speaking is hard
- Do not finish their sentences unless asked

**Emotional Support**
- Stroke survivors often feel frustrated or sad
- Be patient with mood changes
- Encourage them to keep trying
- Help them stay connected with others
- Watch for signs of depression

**Preventing Another Stroke**
- Make sure they take all medications
- Help with healthy eating
- Encourage exercise as approved

- Monitor blood pressure if asked

**Know the Warning Signs**
Remember FAST:
- **F**ace drooping
- **A**rm weakness
- **S**peech difficulty
- **T**ime to call 911`,
