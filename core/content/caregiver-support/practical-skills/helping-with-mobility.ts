        "Helping with mobility means safely assisting someone to move around, stand up, sit down, or get from one place to another.",
      explanation: `When someone has trouble moving on their own, they may need help. Learning the right way to help keeps both of you safe.

**Why Safe Moving Matters**
- Wrong techniques can hurt your back
- Falls can injure your loved one
- Good techniques make moving easier for everyone

**Basic Safety Tips**
- Always tell the person what you are going to do
- Let them help as much as they can
- Never pull on their arms
- Keep your back straight and bend your knees
- Take your time - no rushing
- Wear shoes that do not slip

**Ways You Can Help**
- Offering your arm for balance when walking
- Helping them stand up from a chair
- Guiding them into a car
- Helping them get in and out of bed

**When to Get Help**
- If the person is much heavier than you
- If you have back problems
- If the person cannot help at all
- If there is not enough space to move safely

**Helpful Equipment**
- Walkers and canes
- Grab bars in the bathroom
- Bed rails
- Special lift devices

Ask a nurse or physical therapist to show you safe techniques for your specific situation.`,

        "Mobility assistance involves using proper body mechanics and transfer techniques to help someone move safely while preventing injuries to both the caregiver and care recipient.",
      explanation: `**Understanding Mobility Challenges**

People may need mobility help due to:
- Weakness from illness or surgery
- Balance problems
- Joint pain or stiffness
- Neurological conditions (stroke, Parkinson"s)
- Cognitive impairment affecting coordination

**Body Mechanics for Caregivers**

Proper technique protects your back and makes helping easier:

1. **Stand close** to the person you are helping
2. **Wide base** - feet shoulder-width apart
3. **Bend your knees**, not your back
4. **Tighten your core** muscles
5. **Keep the person close** to your body
6. **Pivot with your feet** - do not twist your back

**Common Transfer Types**

**Bed to Sitting**
1. Help roll to their side
2. Lower legs over edge of bed
3. Support shoulders as they push up
4. Wait for dizziness to pass before standing

**Sitting to Standing**
1. Scoot to edge of chair
2. Feet flat on floor, slightly back
3. Lean forward, nose over toes
4. Push up with legs, not arms
5. Steady before walking

**Chair to Chair/Wheelchair**
1. Position chairs at an angle
2. Lock wheelchair brakes
3. Stand and pivot
4. Lower slowly into seat

**Walking Assistance**
- Walk beside and slightly behind
- Support at waist or gait belt
- Match their pace
- Watch for obstacles

**Equipment Options**
| Device | Use | Benefit |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Gait belt | Transfers and walking | Secure grip |
| Transfer board | Sliding transfers | Less lifting |
| Grab bars | Bathroom | Independence |
| Bed rail | Getting in/out of bed | Support |
| Walker | Walking | Stability |

**When to Ask for Training**
- After any hospitalization
- When abilities change
- If you experience back pain
- Before using new equipment`,

      summary:
        "Mobility assistance requires assessment of functional capacity, application of biomechanical principles, appropriate use of assistive devices, and recognition of fall risk factors to ensure safe transfers and ambulation.",
      explanation: `## Assessment of Mobility Status

**Functional Levels**
1. **Independent** - No assistance needed
2. **Supervision** - Cueing or standby assistance
3. **Minimal assist** - <25% physical help
4. **Moderate assist** - 25-50% physical help
5. **Maximal assist** - 51-75% physical help
6. **Total assist** - 76-100% physical help

**Key Assessment Questions**
- What can they do independently?
- What triggers need for assistance?
- What is their weight-bearing status?
- Are there cognitive factors affecting safety?
- What equipment is currently in use?
- What is the home environment like?

## Biomechanical Principles

**Caregiver Body Mechanics**
- Center of gravity low (bend knees)
- Base of support wide (feet apart)
- Load close to body
- Spine neutral (natural curve maintained)
- Use large muscle groups (legs, not back)
- Avoid twisting - pivot with feet

**Physics of Lifting**
- Moment arm: distance from spine to load
- Keeping load close reduces spinal stress
- 10 lbs at arm"s length = 100+ lbs at spine
- Two-person lifts for heavier individuals

**Friction and Sliding**
- Reduce friction with slide sheets/boards
- Smooth surfaces enable sliding vs. lifting
- Compression garments can increase friction

## Transfer Techniques by Type

**Dependent Transfers (Total Assist)**
- Mechanical lifts recommended
- Two-person minimum without lift
- Proper sling sizing critical
- Check skin for pressure areas

**Stand-Pivot Transfers**
- Requires weight-bearing ability
- Use gait belt
- Clear path of 90 degrees or less
- Proper footwear required

**Sliding Board Transfers**
- For those who cannot stand
- Board bridges gap between surfaces
- Lean away, slide, lean back
- Requires sitting balance

**Bed Mobility**
- Log rolling for spinal precautions
- Use draw sheet for positioning
- Electric beds reduce caregiver strain
- Side rails for support, not restraint

## Fall Risk Factors

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Medications | Sedatives, BP meds, polypharmacy |
| Vision | Correction, lighting |
| Environment | Clutter, rugs, cords |
| Footwear | Nonslip soles, proper fit |
| Cognition | Judgment, impulsivity |
| Strength | Deconditioning, weakness |
| History | Previous falls predictive |

## Equipment Selection

- Canes: mild balance support
- Walkers: moderate support (standard, rolling, wheeled)
- Wheelchairs: non-ambulatory or long distances
