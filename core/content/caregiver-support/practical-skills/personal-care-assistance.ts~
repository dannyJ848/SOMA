**Keeping Everyone Safe**
- Make sure the bathroom is not slippery
- Use grab bars if available
- Check water temperature before bathing
- Have everything ready before you start
- Do not leave them alone if they are unsteady

**Respecting Dignity**
Even though your loved one needs help, they still deserve respect. This means:
