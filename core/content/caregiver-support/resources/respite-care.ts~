        "Respite care gives caregivers a break by having someone else take care of their loved one for a short time.",
      explanation: `Everyone needs a break sometimes. Respite care lets you take time for yourself while knowing your loved one is safe and cared for.

**What Is Respite Care?**
Someone else takes over caregiving for a little while so you can:
- Rest and recharge
- Go to your own doctor appointments
- Spend time with friends
- Handle errands
- Take a vacation
- Just have time alone

**Types of Respite Care**

**In-Home Respite**
- A helper comes to your home
- Can be a few hours or overnight
- Your loved one stays in familiar surroundings

**Adult Day Programs**
- Your loved one goes to a center during the day
- Activities, meals, and supervision
- You have the day free

**Overnight or Residential**
- Your loved one stays at a facility
- Can be a few nights or weeks
- Good for longer breaks or emergencies

**It Is Not Selfish**
- Taking breaks makes you a better caregiver
- Burnout helps no one
- Your health matters too
- Guilt is normal but should not stop you

**Finding Respite Care**
- Ask your doctor or social worker
- Call Area Agency on Aging
- Check with local senior centers
- Contact disease-specific organizations
- Look into faith-based programs`,
