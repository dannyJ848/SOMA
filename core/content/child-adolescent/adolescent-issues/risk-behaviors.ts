# Understanding Adolescent Risk-Taking

## Why Do Teens Take Risks?

It's normal for teenagers to take risks. Understanding why can help you make safer choices.

### Brain Development
- Your brain is still developing until about age 25
- The part that seeks excitement (emotional brain) develops first
- The part that helps you make good decisions (thinking brain) develops last
- This creates a mismatch that can lead to risky choices

### Social Reasons
- Wanting to fit in with friends
- Feeling pressure from peers
- Trying to impress others
- Fear of missing out
- Not wanting to seem "uncool"

### Emotional Reasons
- Seeking excitement and new experiences
- Feeling invincible ("bad things won't happen to me")
- Dealing with stress or difficult emotions
- Rebellion against rules

## Common Risk Behaviors

### Substance Use
- Alcohol, vaping, tobacco, or drugs
- Can affect your brain development
- Can lead to addiction
- Can cause accidents and injuries

### Unsafe Sexual Behavior
- Sex without protection
- Risk of pregnancy and STIs
- Emotional consequences
- Can affect your future

### Dangerous Driving
- Speeding
- Not wearing seatbelt
- Distracted driving (texting, etc.)

- Fighting or violence
- Can lead to serious injuries

## Making Safer Choices

### Before You Act
- STOP and think before doing something risky
- Ask yourself: What could go wrong?

- Think about your future
- Remove yourself from pressure situations

### Strategies to Avoid Risk
- Have an exit plan ready
- Blame your parents if needed ("My mom would kill me")
- Choose friends who make good choices
- Practice saying "no"
- Trust your gut—if something feels wrong, don't do it

### Talking to Trusted Adults
- Parents, teachers, coaches, counselors
- They can help you think through situations
- They've been through similar things
- Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness

## When Risk-Taking Becomes a Problem

### Warning Signs
- Taking risks that could seriously hurt you

- School counselor
- Doctor or nurse
- Mental health professional
- Crisis lines if you need immediate help

## Remember
- Risk-taking is normal during adolescence
- Not all risk-taking is bad (trying new things, meeting new people)
- The key is thinking before acting
- Your choices today affect your tomorrow
- It's never too late to start making safer choices

# Sexual Risk Behaviors and Safety

## Understanding Sexual Decision-Making

### Why Sexual Decisions Matter
- Can affect your health
- Can affect your relationships
- Can affect your future
- Can have emotional consequences
- Can result in pregnancy or STIs

### Pressures to Be Sexual
- Peer pressure (everyone's doing it)
- Partner pressure
- Media influence
- Wanting to be seen as mature
- Curiosity

### You Decide
- No one should pressure you
- Only have sex when YOU want to
- It's okay to wait
- Set your own boundaries
- Change your mind at any point
- No is a complete sentence

## Consent

### What Is Consent?
- Freely given (not pressured or coerced)
- Reversible (can change your mind)
- Informed (knowing what you're agreeing to)
- Enthusiastic (wanting to participate, not just agreeing)
- Specific (for each activity)
- Sober (can't consent if under the influence)

### Asking for Consent
- "Is this okay?"
- "Do you want to..."
- "Can I kiss you?"
- Check in during sexual activity
- Respect the answer, whatever it is

### Responding to "No" or "Maybe"
- "No" means no
- "Maybe" means no for now
- Silence is not consent
- Don't pressure or guilt
- Don't get angry

## Pregnancy Prevention

### Contraception Options

#### Abstinence
- Only 100% effective method
- No risk of pregnancy or STIs
- Valid choice for any amount of time

#### Barrier Methods
- **External condom (male condom)**: 85% typical use, worn on penis
- **Internal condom (female condom)**: Similar effectiveness, inserted into vagina
- Reduce risk of both pregnancy and STIs
- Available without prescription

#### Hormonal Methods (require prescription)
- **Pill**: Take daily, 91% effective with typical use
- **Patch**: Worn weekly, changed monthly
- **Ring**: Inserted monthly
- **Shot**: Given every 3 months
- **Implant**: Inserted under arm, lasts 3 years
- **IUD**: Inserted in uterus, lasts 3-12 years

#### Emergency Contraception
- **Plan B**: Available over-the-counter, works up to 72 hours
- **Ella**: Prescription, works up to 5 days
- **Copper IUD**: Most effective, can be inserted up to 5 days

### How Effective Is Your Method?
- Perfect use: Always using correctly
- Typical use: How most people use it (includes mistakes)
- No method (except abstinence) is 100% effective
- Using two methods (condoms + another) is most effective

## Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)

### Common STIs
- **HPV** (human papillomavirus): Most common STI, causes genital warts and cervical cancer
- **Chlamydia**: Often no symptoms, can cause infertility
- **Gonorrhea**: Can have no symptoms
- **Herpes**: Painful blisters, lifelong infection
- **Trichomoniasis**: Parasitic infection
- **HIV**: Virus that attacks immune system
- **Syphilis**: Bacterial infection, serious if untreated

### Prevention
- Abstinence: Only 100% effective
- Condoms: Significantly reduce risk (but not 100%)
- HPV vaccine: Prevents most HPV strains
- Limit number of partners
- Get tested regularly if sexually active
- Partner treatment: Both partners need treatment

### Testing
- Who should test: Anyone who is sexually active
- How often: At least annually, more often with multiple partners
- What tests: Ask your doctor which tests you need
- Where: Doctor's office, clinic, some schools
- Most STIs can be treated or managed

## Safer Sex Practices

### Before Sexual Activity
- Talk about protection with your partner
- Have protection available (condoms, etc.)

# Distracted and Dangerous Driving

## The Risks of Teen Driving

### Why Teen Driving Is Risky
- **Inexperience**: Haven't developed driving skills
- **Brain development**: Judgment and impulse control still developing
- **Risk-taking**: More likely to take risks while driving
- **Passengers**: Distraction from friends
- **Distractions**: Phones, music, eating, etc.

### Statistics
- Car crashes are a leading cause of death for teens
- Teens are 3x more likely than adults to be in fatal crash
- Risk highest in first months of driving
- Risk increases with each teen passenger

## Distracted Driving

### Types of Distractions

#### Visual Distractions (Eyes off road)

- Daydreaming
- Focused on music or podcast
- Driving while tired

### Cell Phone Use While Driving

#### Texting and Driving
- **Texting** involves all three types of distraction
- Takes eyes off road for 5 seconds at a time
- At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of a football field blindfolded
- Increases crash risk by 23x
- Illegal in most states

#### Talking on Phone
- Even hands-free is distracting
- Slows reaction time
- Reduces awareness of surroundings
- Increases crash risk

#### Social Media and Streaming
- Checking notifications
- posting or scrolling
- watching videos
- live streaming while driving

### Other Distractions

#### Passengers
- Teen passengers increase crash risk
- More passengers = more distraction
- Loud conversations
- Rowdy behavior
- Showing things to driver

#### Eating and Drinking
- Spills cause reactions
- Takes hands off wheel
- Takes eyes off road

#### Grooming
- Applying makeup
- Brushing hair
- Fixing clothes

#### Outside Distractions
- Looking at crashes or scenes
- Reading signs
- Looking at other cars

## Impaired Driving

### Alcohol and Driving

#### Legal Limits
- Under 21: ANY alcohol is illegal (zero tolerance laws)
- Over 21: 0.08% BAC is legal limit
- Even one drink affects driving ability

#### Effects on Driving
- Slows reaction time
- Impairs judgment
- Affects coordination
- Reduces ability to focus
- Increases risk-taking

#### Consequences
- DUI/DWI charges
- Loss of license
- Fines
- Jail time
- Higher insurance
- Injury or death

### Marijuana and Driving
- Illegal to drive under the influence
- Impairs reaction time, coordination, judgment
- Can stay in system for days after use
- Field sobriety tests can detect impairment

### Other Drugs and Driving
- Prescription drugs (check labels for warnings)
- Over-the-counter medications (some cause drowsiness)
- Illegal drugs (never drive after use)

### Drowsy Driving
- Just as dangerous as drunk driving
- Falling asleep at wheel causes serious crashes
- Warning signs: heavy eyes, drifting, missing exits
- Prevention: Get enough sleep, take breaks on long drives, don't drive when you'd normally be asleep

## Speeding and Risky Driving

### Speeding
- Increases stopping distance
- Reduces time to react
- Increases crash severity
- Common among teen drivers
- Often due to overconfidence or running late

### Risky Driving Behaviors
- **Tailgating**: Following too closely
- **Weaving**: Changing lanes unsafely
- **Racing**: Illegal and dangerous
- **Running red lights/stop signs**: Dangerous intersections
- **Street racing**: Extremely dangerous
- **Showing off**: For passengers or others

## Seat Belts

### Why Wear Seat Belts
- Reduce risk of death by 45%
- Reduce risk of serious injury by 50%
- Keep you in position for airbags
- Prevent ejection from vehicle
- It's the law

### Common Excuses (and why they're wrong)
- "I'm just going down the street": Most crashes happen close to home
- "I'm a good driver": You can't control other drivers
- "It's uncomfortable": Getting ejected is more uncomfortable
- "I have airbags": Airbags are designed to work WITH seat belts, not alone
- "I'll brace myself": You can't in a crash

### Proper Seat Belt Use
- Lap belt across hips, not stomach
- Shoulder belt across chest, not neck
- Never put shoulder belt under arm or behind back
- Check everyone's belt before moving

## Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL)

### What Is GDL?
- Step-by-step approach to full driving privileges
- Gives new drivers experience under lower-risk conditions
- Has been shown to reduce teen crashes

### Typical Stages

#### Learner's Permit
- Must drive with licensed adult
- Usually practice for 6-12 months
- Log supervised driving hours
- Pass knowledge and road tests

#### Intermediate/Provisional License
- Can drive alone with restrictions
- Limits on passengers
- Limits on night driving
- No cell phone use
- Must remain violation-free

#### Full License
- No restrictions
- Earned by demonstrating safe driving

### Passenger Laws
- Limit teen passengers for first 6-12 months
- Each additional passenger increases risk
- Siblings may be exception in some states
- Follow state laws

### Night Driving Restrictions
- Highest risk time for teen crashes
- Restricted to daytime or early evening hours
- Usually for first 6-12 months
- Follow state laws

## Developing Safe Driving Habits

### Before You Drive
- Plan your route
- Allow enough time (no rushing)
- Adjust seat, mirrors, controls
- Put phone away or on do not disturb
- Ensure everyone is buckled

### While Driving
- Focus only on driving
- Keep eyes scanning the road
- Check mirrors regularly
- Leave space between you and car ahead
- Follow speed limits
- Use turn signals
- Anticipate what other drivers might do

### In Difficult Conditions
- **Rain**: Slow down, increase following distance, turn on lights
- **Snow/ice**: Much slower, gentle movements, may not drive at all
- **Night**: Reduce speed, look for pedestrians/animals
- **Heavy traffic**: Stay alert, maintain space, be patient

### If Something Happens
- **Break down**: Move to shoulder if possible, turn on hazards, call for help
- **Get pulled over**: Pull over safely, stay in car, follow officer's instructions
- **In crash**: Check for injuries, call police, exchange information, take photos
- **Road rage**: Don't engage, lock doors, drive to police station if followed

## Helping Friends Drive Safely

### Be a Good Passenger
- Don't distract the driver
- Help with navigation
- Adjust controls if needed
- Speak up if driver is being unsafe
- Offer to drive or call for ride if driver shouldn't be driving

### Intervening When Needed
- Don't ride with someone who has been drinking or using drugs
- Call for ride, stay where you are, or find safe ride
- Don't worry about being polite—safety first
- It's okay to make up an excuse to avoid riding with unsafe driver
- Your friends might be annoyed, but they'll be alive

# Evidence-Based Prevention and Intervention

## Understanding Risk Behavior

### The Risk-Taking Paradox
- Risk-taking is developmentally appropriate (part of becoming independent)
- Not all risk-taking is harmful (trying new activities, standing up for beliefs)
- Some risk-taking is necessary for growth
- Challenge: Channel risk-taking into positive outlets

### Dual Systems Model
- **Socioemotional system**: Seeks rewards, peaks in adolescence
- **Cognitive control system**: Impulse control, matures into mid-20s
- **Imbalance**: Explains why teens take more risks
- **Social context**: Peer presence doubles risk-taking
- **Individual differences**: Not all adolescents have same imbalance

### Why Traditional Approaches Fail

#### Scare Tactics Don't Work
- "Just say no" programs ineffective
- Scare-based programs (e.g., DARE) show limited long-term effectiveness
- Graphic images don't lead to sustained behavior change
- Teens dismiss exaggerated claims
- Can backfire by increasing curiosity

#### Information Alone Is Insufficient
- Most teens already know risks
- Knowledge doesn't equal behavior change
- Risk perception already high among teens
- They underestimate personal vulnerability, not general risk

## Effective Prevention Approaches

### Correcting Misperceptions

#### Social Norms Marketing
- Teens overestimate peer risk behaviors
- "Everyone is doing it" misperception
- Correcting misperceptions reduces behavior
- Approach: Show actual (lower) rates of use
- Example: "Most teens at this school don't vape"

#### Working Through:
1. Survey students about actual behaviors
2. Share real data: "Actually, only 15% of students vape"
3. Correct misperceptions without preaching
4. Reduces pressure to conform to perceived norms

### Motivational Interviewing

#### What Is It?
- Collaborative conversation style
- Draws out person's own motivations
- Non-confrontational
- Respects autonomy
- Resolves ambivalence

#### Key Elements
- Express empathy
- Develop discrepancy (between current behavior and goals)
- Roll with resistance (don't argue)
- Support self-efficacy

#### Use with Adolescents
- Brief interventions in healthcare settings
- School counseling
- Effective for substance use
- Respects teen's developing autonomy

### Positive Youth Development (PYD)

#### The 5 Cs Framework
1. **Competence**: Positive views of abilities
2. **Confidence**: Internal sense of self-worth
3. **Connection**: Positive bonds with people and institutions
4. **Character**: Respect for societal and moral norms
5. **Caring**: Empathy and sympathy for others

**Plus**: **Contribution** to self, family, community

#### How PYD Prevents Risk Behaviors
- Focus on strengths, not problems
- Provides meaningful alternatives
- Builds skills for healthy development
- Creates connection to community
- Gives youth voice and agency

### Structured Risk-Taking Opportunities

#### Why It Works
- Adolescents seek stimulation
- Provide healthy outlets for risk-taking
- Satisfies sensation-seeking needs
- Develops skills in controlled environment

#### Examples
- Sports and athletics
- Performing arts (performing is a risk)
- Outdoor adventure programs
- Leadership roles
- Entrepreneurship

#### Evidence
- Participation in sports associated with less substance use
- Arts participation linked to better outcomes
- Adventure therapy programs show positive effects
- Risk-taking in safe contexts reduces risk-taking in unsafe contexts

## Screening and Brief Intervention (SBIRT)

### Components
1. **Screening**: Universal screening for risk behaviors
2. **Brief Intervention**: 10-15 minute conversation
3. **Referral to Treatment**: For those who need more intensive help

### CRAFFT Screening Tool
For adolescent substance use:

**C** - Have you ever ridden in a **Car** driven by someone who was high or had been using alcohol?
**R** - Do you ever use alcohol or drugs to **Relax**, feel better about yourself, or fit in?
**A** - Do you ever use alcohol or drugs while you are **Alone**?
**F** - Do you ever **Forget** things you did while using alcohol or drugs?
**F** - Do your family or **Friends** ever tell you that you should cut down on your drinking or drug use?
**T** - Have you ever gotten into **Trouble** while you were using alcohol or drugs?

2+ "yes" answers indicates need for further assessment

### Brief Intervention Steps
1. Ask about use
2. Provide feedback (compare to norms)
3. Discuss risks and consequences
4. Explore ambivalence
5. Set goals
6. Follow up

## School-Based Prevention

### Effective Components

#### Social and Emotional Learning (SEL)
- Self-awareness
- Self-management
- Social awareness
- Relationship skills
- Responsible decision-making

#### Life Skills Training
- Resistance skills
- Coping with stress
- Managing emotions
- Problem-solving
- Communication

#### Comprehensive Programs
- Multi-year, not one-time
- Interactive, not lecture-based
- Involve parents and community
- Target multiple risk behaviors
- Include peer leadership

### What Works
- Interactive approaches (role-play, discussions)
- Peer-led components
- Parent involvement
- Normative education
- Resistance skills training
- Life skills training

### What Doesn't Work
- One-time assemblies
- Scare tactics
- Purely informational approaches
- Exhortation ("just say no")
- Testimonial-only approaches

## Family-Based Prevention

### Protective Family Factors
- Strong parent-child relationship
- Clear expectations and rules
- Monitoring and supervision
- Open communication
- Parental involvement in teen's life
- Modeling healthy behaviors

### Effective Parenting Strategies

#### Monitoring and Knowledge
- Know where teen is, who they're with
- Know parents of teen's friends
- Check in regularly
- Expect to be told about plans changes

#### Parent-Teen Communication
- Open, non-judgmental discussions
- Listen more than talk
- Ask curiosity questions
- Share your values and concerns
- Discuss scenarios before they happen

#### Rule-Setting
- Clear rules about risk behaviors
- Consistent enforcement
- Explain reasons behind rules
- Adjust rules appropriately as teen matures
- Negotiate some rules with teen input

#### Managing Risk Situations
- Know what's happening when teen is out
- Check that adults are present at parties
- Talk about how to handle risky situations
- Provide "out" if needed (blame parents)
- Pick up without questions anytime

## Policy Approaches

### Effective Policies

#### Minimum Legal Drinking Age (21)
- One of most effective public health policies
- Reduced alcohol-related deaths
- Delayed initiation reduces lifetime risk

#### Tobacco Age 21
- Reduces initiation
- Reduces access in schools
- Prevents younger teens from getting from older teens

#### Graduated Driver Licensing
- Reduces teen crashes by 20-40%
- Reduces teen deaths
- Most comprehensive states see best results

#### Tobacco Taxes
- Higher prices reduce youth use
- Especially effective for preventing initiation

#### Smoke-Free Laws
- Reduce secondhand smoke exposure
- Change social norms around smoking
- Reduce youth smoking rates

## Digital Interventions

### Technology-Based Prevention

#### Text Messaging Programs
- Deliver health messages
- Support behavior change
- Reach teens where they are
- Can be personalized

#### Mobile Apps
- Goal-setting and tracking
- Coping skills
- Crisis resources
- Social support

#### Social Media
- Peer-to-peer support
- Positive message dissemination
- Challenging norms
- Counter-misinformation

### Concerns
- Privacy and data security
- Evidence quality varies
- Need for engagement
- Digital divide (access issues)

## Treatment for Problematic Behaviors

### Substance Use Treatment

#### Levels of Care
- **Outpatient**: Live at home, regular treatment sessions
- **Intensive outpatient**: Several hours daily, several days/week
- **Partial hospitalization**: Day treatment
- **Residential/inpatient**: Live at treatment facility
- **Medically managed**: 24-hour care, medical monitoring

#### Adolescent-Specific Treatment
- Family involvement crucial
- School integration important
- Age-appropriate therapy
- Peer group therapy
- Address co-occurring mental health
- Consider developmental stage

#### Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT)
- **Opioid use disorder**: Buprenorphine, naltrexone
- **Alcohol use disorder**: Naltrexone, acamprosate
- **Nicotine use**: Varenicline, NRT
- Combined with counseling for best outcomes
- Evidence supports use in adolescents
