# Understanding Sexual Health

## What Is Sexual Health?

Sexual health is about more than just sex. It includes:
- Understanding your body
- Making healthy decisions
- Having respectful relationships
- Protecting your health
- Feeling good about yourself

## Your Body, Your Decisions

### You Are in Charge
- Only YOU decide what happens with your body
- No one should pressure you to do anything you don't want to do
- It's okay to say "no" at any time
- It's okay to wait until you're ready
- It's okay to change your mind

### Consent Is Essential
- Consent means freely agreeing to participate
- Consent should be enthusiastic, not just absence of "no"
- Consent can be withdrawn at any time
- Consent for one thing is not consent for everything
- You cannot consent if you're under the influence of alcohol or drugs

## Sexual Activity Decisions

### Before You Decide
- Are you doing this because YOU want to?
- Do you trust your partner?
- Can you talk openly with your partner?
- Do you have protection?
- What if your parents/friends found out?
- Will you feel good about this tomorrow?

### It's Okay to Wait
- There's no "right" age to become sexually active
- Only have sex when YOU want to
- Many people wait until they're older or in a committed relationship
- You're not missing out
- This is YOUR decision

## Protection

### Why Protection Matters
- Prevents pregnancy
- Prevents sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
- Shows responsibility for your health and your partner's health
- Both partners are responsible for protection

### Types of Protection
- **Condoms**: Protect against pregnancy AND most STIs
- **Birth control pills**: Prevent pregnancy but NOT STIs
- **Other methods**: Many options available
- **Best option**: Condoms + another method = most protection

## Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)

### What Are STIs?
- Infections passed through sexual activity
- Many have no symptoms
- Very common - millions of people get them each year
- Most can be treated or managed

### Common STIs
- HPV (very common, can cause cancer)
- Chlamydia (very common, can cause infertility)
- Gonorrhea
- Herpes
- HIV
- Syphilis
- Trichomoniasis

### Protection
- Abstinence (not having sex) - only 100% effective
- Condoms - very effective when used correctly
- HPV vaccine - prevents most HPV strains
- Get tested regularly if sexually active
- Limit number of partners

## Healthy Relationships

### Signs of Healthy Relationship
- You feel comfortable and safe
- You can be yourself
- You can talk openly
- Both partners' needs are important
- You respect each other's boundaries
- Both partners consent to everything

### Warning Signs of Unhealthy Relationship
- Pressure to do things you don't want to do

- Keeping you from friends/family
- Physical or sexual violence

## Getting Help and Information

# Advanced Topics in Sexual Health

## Contraceptive Effectiveness

### Understanding Failure Rates

#### Perfect Use vs. Typical Use
- **Perfect use**: Using method correctly and consistently every time
- **Typical use**: How most people use it (includes mistakes)
- Difference is significant for methods requiring user action

#### Method Effectiveness (First Year, Typical Use)
- **Implant**: 0.1% failure
- **IUDs**: 0.1-0.8% failure
- **Injectable**: 4% failure
- **Pill, patch, ring**: 7-9% failure
- **Male condom**: 13% failure
- **Withdrawal**: 22% failure
- **No method**: 85% chance of pregnancy

### Dual Protection
- Condoms + another method = best protection
- Prevents pregnancy AND STIs
- Recommended for all sexually active teens
- Reduces risk of both pregnancy and infection

## Contraceptive Selection

### Medical Eligibility Criteria
- WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use
- Categories 1-4:
  - **Category 1**: No restriction
  - **Category 2**: Advantages generally outweigh risks
  - **Category 3**: Risks usually outweigh advantages
  - **Category 4**: Unacceptable health risk

### Combined Hormonal Contraception Considerations

#### Absolute Contraindications (Category 4)
- Migraine with aura at any age
- History of VTE (blood clot)
- Current breast cancer
- Uncontrolled hypertension

- Smoking <15 cigarettes/day and age ≥35
- Multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease
- Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding
- Breastfeeding <6 weeks postpartum

### LARC Insertion in Adolescents

#### Concerns vs. Evidence
- Concern: Nulliparity, uterine size, expulsion risk
- Evidence: Safe and effective in adolescents
- Expulsion rate slightly higher than adults but still low
- Pain management for insertion important

#### Counseling Considerations
- Discuss what to expect during insertion
- Pain management options
- Irregular bleeding initially (hormonal IUD) or heavier periods (copper)
- Reversible but requires clinician for removal
- Does not protect against STIs

## STI Epidemiology and Prevention

### STI Surveillance Data
- Chlamydia: Highest rates in women 15-24
- Gonorrhea: Increasing rates, especially in men who have sex with men
- Syphilis: Increasing rates, especially in men who have sex with men
- HPV: Very common, most sexually active people get it
- Herpes: About 1 in 6 people 14-49 have HSV-2

### Antibiotic Resistance
- Gonorrhea becoming resistant to many antibiotics
- Current treatment: Ceftriaxone + azithromycin (dual therapy)
- Ongoing concern for untreatable gonorrhea
- Importance of completing treatment and partner treatment

### Expedited Partner Therapy (EPT)
- Prescribing antibiotics for partners of patients with chlamydia or gonorrhea
- Partner doesn't need to be seen by provider
- Increases partner treatment rates
- Legal in most states
- Not appropriate for pregnancy or complex cases

### PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) for HIV

#### Indications
- Sexually active MSM
- Heterosexual with partner with HIV
- People who inject drugs
- At substantial risk for HIV

#### Medications
