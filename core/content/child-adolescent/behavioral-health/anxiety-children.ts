# Managing Anxiety at Home and School

## Understanding and Responding to Anxiety

### The Anxiety Cycle
1. Trigger (something that causes anxiety)
2. Anxious thoughts and physical symptoms
3. Avoidance or safety behaviors
4. Short-term relief
5. Reinforcement of anxiety (anxiety gets stronger)
6. Next time, anxiety is worse

### Breaking the Cycle

- "I can see you're nervous about this"

#### What Not to Say
- "Don't worry" (easier said than done)

## Teaching Coping Skills

### Progressive Muscle Relaxation
- Tense and relax muscle groups
- Start with feet, work up to head
- Tense for 5 seconds, relax for 10 seconds
- Notice difference between tension and relaxation
- Practice daily

### Deep Breathing
- Diaphragmatic breathing
- Belly breathing
- Square breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4)
- 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8)
- Practice daily, not just when anxious

### Imagery and Visualization

- Use all senses in imagery
- Practice when calm first
- Use when anxious

### Mindfulness and Acceptance
- Observe thoughts and feelings without judgment
- Notice anxiety without engaging
- Accept feelings without fighting
- Return attention to present moment
- Practice regularly

### Worry Time
- Schedule worry time (e.g., 15 minutes daily)
- Postpone worries to worry time
- Worry productively during worry time
- Problem-solve real problems, let go of others
- Stop worrying when time is up

### Problem-Solving Skills
- Identify worry
- Is this a real problem or hypothetical worry?
- If real: problem-solve
- If hypothetical: let go or accept uncertainty
- Steps: define, brainstorm, evaluate, choose, implement, review

## Relapse Prevention

#### Identifying Triggers
- Situations that trigger anxiety
- Times when anxiety worse
- Patterns in anxiety
- Early warning signs

#### Maintenance
- Continue using skills
- Regular practice
- Review skills periodically

# Advanced Topics in Childhood Anxiety

## Neurobiology of Anxiety

### Brain Systems Involved

#### Amygdala
- Fear processing center
- Activated by threats
- Hyperactive in anxiety disorders
- Triggers fight-flight-freeze response
- Important for fear conditioning

#### Prefrontal Cortex
- Regulation of fear response
- Executive functioning
- Cognitive reappraisal
- Weaker regulation of amygdala in anxiety
- Still developing in children

#### Hippocampus
- Contextual fear learning
- Memory formation
- Contextualizing threats
- Smaller in some anxiety disorders

#### Anterior Cingulate Cortex
- Error detection
- Conflict monitoring
- Emotional regulation
- Hyperactive in anxiety

#### Insula
- Interoceptive awareness (body sensations)
- Anxiety about bodily sensations
- Interoceptive exposure targets this

### Neurotransmitter Systems

#### Serotonin
- Mood regulation
- Involved in anxiety and depression
- Target of SSRIs (first-line medication)
- Dysregulated in anxiety disorders

#### GABA
- Inhibitory neurotransmitter
- Calming effect
- Target of benzodiazepines
- May be deficient in anxiety

#### Norepinephrine
- Arousal and vigilance
- Involved in panic
- Physical symptoms of anxiety
- Target of SNRIs

### Fear Conditioning and Extinction

#### Fear Conditioning
- Learning to fear a neutral stimulus
- Association between neutral and aversive stimulus
- Amygdala-dependent
- Basis of specific phobias

#### Fear Extinction
- Learning that a feared stimulus is not dangerous
- New learning (not unlearning)
- Basis of exposure therapy
- Involves prefrontal cortex inhibition of amygdala
- Can be blocked by stress

#### Extinction Learning
- Retrieval of extinction memory
- Context-dependent
- Renewal effect (return in different context)
- Spontaneous recovery (return over time)
- Reinstatement (return after stress)

## Genetics and Epigenetics

### Heritability
- Anxiety disorders have moderate heritability (~30-40%)
- Not as heritable as some other disorders
- Significant environmental contribution
- Gene-environment interaction

### Genetic Factors

#### Specific Genes
- **SLC6A4**: Serotonin transporter
- **COMT**: Enzyme that breaks down dopamine
- **MAOA**: Enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters
- **BDNF**: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
- **FKBP5**: Stress response

#### Polygenic Risk
- Many genes with small effects
- No single "anxiety gene"
- Polygenic risk scores
- Interaction with environment

### Epigenetics
- Environmental influences on gene expression
- Stress can affect gene expression
- Parental anxiety affects offspring
- Prenatal stress effects
- Transgenerational transmission

## Temperament and Risk Factors

### Behavioral Inhibition
- Temperament style
- Shy, fearful response to novelty
- Stable trait from early childhood
- Risk factor for anxiety disorders
- About 15-20% of children
- Amygdala hyperreactivity

### Other Temperament Risk Factors
- Negative affectivity
- Low effortful control
- High reactivity
- Low soothability

### Environmental Risk Factors

#### Parenting Factors
- Overprotective parenting
- Modeling of anxious behaviors
- Parental anxiety (genetic + environmental)
- Accommodation of child anxiety
- Criticism or rejection

#### Life Stress
- Trauma
- Abuse or neglect
- Family conflict
- Parental separation/divorce
- Chronic stress
- Major life changes

#### Social Factors
- Bullying
- Social difficulties
- Lack of social support
- Peer rejection
- Social isolation

### Protective Factors
- Easy temperament
- Good social skills
- Supportive relationships
- Parental warmth
- Self-efficacy
- Coping skills
- Positive school environment
