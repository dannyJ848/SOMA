# Understanding Conduct Disorder

## What Is Conduct Disorder?

Conduct disorder (CD) is a behavioral condition in which children and adolescents show serious and persistent behavioral problems.

### Important Things to Know
- CD involves ongoing patterns of behavior that violate rules or the rights of others
- It's more than just "acting out" or being naughty
- Children with CD have trouble following rules and respecting others
- They may have difficulty showing empathy and feeling guilty
- CD can be treated, especially when caught early
- Children with CD need help, not just punishment

## Signs of Conduct Disorder

### Common Behaviors
- Aggression toward people or animals
- Destroying property on purpose
- Lying or stealing
- Breaking serious rules
- Skipping school regularly
- Staying out late without permission
- Running away from home overnight

### Aggressive Behaviors
- Bullying or threatening others
- Starting fights
- Using weapons
- Being physically cruel to people
- Being physically cruel to animals
- Stealing while confronting a victim (like mugging)

### Non-Aggressive Behaviors
- Destroying property (vandalism, fire-setting)
- Breaking into houses, buildings, or cars
- Lying to get things or avoid obligations
- Stealing without confronting a victim (shoplifting, forgery)

### Rule-Breaking
- Staying out at night despite parents' rules (before age 13)
- Running away from home overnight at least twice
- Skipping school regularly (before age 13)

## How CD Is Different From Typical Misbehavior

### Normal Childhood Misbehavior
- Happens occasionally
- Child feels bad afterward
- Responds to discipline
- Learns from consequences
- Doesn't seriously harm others
- Doesn't persist despite consequences

### Conduct Disorder
- Happens frequently
- Child may not feel bad or guilty
- Doesn't respond well to typical discipline
- Continues despite consequences
- Can seriously harm others
- Persists over time
- Violates social norms or others' rights

## What Causes CD?

### Many Factors Can Contribute
- **Genetics**: Tends to run in families
- **Brain chemistry**: Certain brain chemicals may be imbalanced
- **Environment**: Chaotic home, abuse, neglect
- **Parenting**: Harsh or inconsistent discipline, lack of supervision
- **Trauma**: Experiencing violence or abuse
- **Learning**: May learn behaviors from others
- **Temperament**: Some children are more difficult from birth

### It's Complex
- No single cause
- Different for each child
- Multiple factors usually involved
- Not the child's fault
- Not always the parents' fault
- But environment and parenting can help

## Ages and Stages

### CD Can Start at Different Ages

#### Early-Onset CD (Before Age 10)
- More serious
- More likely to continue into adulthood
- More likely to have other problems
- Often associated with callous-unemotional traits
- More challenging to treat

#### Adolescent-Onset CD (After Age 10)
- Less serious overall
- More likely to outgrow it
- Often associated with peer influences
- More responsive to treatment
- Less likely to have long-term problems

## Getting Help

### When to Seek Professional Help
- Behaviors are frequent and severe
- Behaviors are causing problems at school, home, or with friends
- Behaviors have lasted 6+ months
- Behaviors are getting worse
- Typical discipline doesn't work
- Child is hurting others or themselves
- You're feeling overwhelmed

### Who Can Help
- Pediatrician or family doctor
- Child psychologist or psychiatrist
- Mental health counselor or therapist
- School counselor or psychologist
- Social worker
- Child and adolescent services

## Treatment Options

### Therapy and Counseling
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Helps child learn different ways of thinking and behaving
- **Family therapy**: Helps family communicate and function better
- **Parent management training**: Teaches parents strategies to manage behavior
- **Social skills training**: Teaches appropriate ways to interact with others
- **Anger management**: Teaches healthy ways to handle anger

### School-Based Programs
- Individualized education plan (IEP) or 504 plan
- Behavioral support
- Counseling services
- Small group instruction
- Positive behavior supports

### Medication
- May be used for co-occurring conditions (ADHD, depression, anxiety)
- Not used specifically for CD
- Can help with impulsivity, aggression, irritability

### For Severe Cases
- Intensive outpatient programs
- Day treatment programs
- Residential treatment
- Hospitalization (if danger to self or others)

## How Parents Can Help

### What Works
- **Clear rules and expectations**: Child knows exactly what's expected
- **Consistent consequences**: Same behavior always has same result
- **Immediate consequences**: Consequences happen right after behavior
- **Positive reinforcement**: Reward good behavior
- **Supervision**: Know where child is and what they're doing
- **Praise**: Notice and praise good behavior often
- **Quality time**: Spend positive time together daily

### What Doesn't Work
- Harsh physical punishment
- Inconsistent discipline
- Yelling and threatening
- Ignoring the problem
- Waiting for child to "grow out of it"
- Only punishing, never rewarding

## School Strategies

### Working with the School
- Communicate regularly with teachers
- Develop a behavior plan
- Consistent consequences at home and school
- Positive behavior support
- Social skills groups
- Counseling services

## Long-Term Outlook

### Prognosis Depends On
- Age of onset (earlier is more serious)
- Severity of symptoms
- Co-occurring problems
- Family functioning
- Treatment involvement
- Callous-unemotional traits

### Many Children Improve
- Especially with treatment
- Especially adolescent-onset CD
- Especially when parents are involved in treatment
- Some continue to have problems into adulthood
- Early intervention helps

## Remember
- Children with CD are not "bad kids"
- They need help and treatment
- Early intervention is important
- Treatment can be very effective
- Parents play a crucial role in treatment
- There is hope for improvement

- Must be present for at least 12 months (can be diagnosed before 12 months if all required features are met and negative consequences are severe)
- Diagnosed only if behaviors are not exclusively during psychotic or substance use disorder

## Age of Onset Subtypes

### Childhood-Onset Type

# Advanced Topics in Conduct Disorder

## Neurobiology and Genetics

### Brain Structure and Function

#### Prefrontal Cortex
- Responsible for executive functions
- Impulse control
- Decision-making
- Moral reasoning
- Reduced volume or activity in CD
- Underdeveloped in youth

#### Amygdala
- Emotional processing
- Fear conditioning
- Empathy
- Reduced responsiveness to distress cues
- May contribute to callous-unemotional traits

#### Anterior Cingulate Cortex
- Error detection
- Conflict monitoring
- Reduced sensitivity to punishment
- Difficulty learning from consequences

#### Connectivity
- Reduced connectivity between emotion and control regions
- Imbalance between limbic and prefrontal systems
- May underlie impulsive aggression

### Neurotransmitter Systems

#### Serotonin
- Mood regulation
- Impulse control
- Aggression
- Low levels associated with aggression
- Involved in impulsivity

#### Dopamine
- Reward processing
- Motivation
- Sensation-seeking
- Reward deficiency hypothesis
- May contribute to risk-taking

#### Norepinephrine
- Arousal and vigilance
- Impulse control
- Aggression
- May be dysregulated

### Genetics

#### Heritability
- Moderate to high heritability (~50%)
- Higher in more severe, early-onset cases
- Not a single gene
- Polygenic (many genes)

#### Candidate Genes
- **MAOA** (Monoamine oxidase A): Low-activity variant increases risk with maltreatment
- **COMT**: Involved in dopamine breakdown
- **Serotonin transporter gene**: Impulse control, aggression
- **Dopamine receptor genes**: Reward, sensation-seeking

#### Gene-Environment Interactions
- **MAOA + maltreatment**: Strong interaction
- Genetic vulnerability + adverse environment = worse outcome
- Genetic resilience + supportive environment = better outcome
- Differential susceptibility to environment
