# Advanced Topics in Childhood Depression

## Neurobiology of Depression

### Brain Systems

#### Structural Differences
- **Hippocampus**: Smaller volume in depression, stress-related
- **Prefrontal cortex**: Thinner cortex, affects executive function
- **Amygdala**: Hyperactive to negative stimuli
- **Anterior cingulate cortex**: Altered in depression
- **Corpus callosum: Developmental differences

#### Functional Differences
- Default mode network dysregulation
- Emotional processing networks hyperactive
- Cognitive control networks hypoactive
- Reward processing deficits
- Increased amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli

### Neurotransmitter Systems

#### Serotonin
- Mood regulation
- Sleep regulation
- Appetite regulation
- Target of SSRIs
- Dysregulated in depression
- Developmental changes in system

#### Norepinephrine
- Energy, motivation
- Attention, focus
- Target of SNRIs
- Dysregulated in depression

#### Dopamine
- Reward, pleasure
- Motivation
- Anhedonia related to dopamine
- Reward system deficits

### Neuroendocrine Systems

#### HPA Axis (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal)
- Stress response system
- Hyperactive in depression
- Cortisol dysregulation
- Can affect brain development
- May mediate stress-depression link

#### Inflammation
- Increased inflammatory markers
- Cytokines affect mood
- Stress increases inflammation
- May be mechanism linking stress and depression
- Potential treatment target

### Developmental Considerations

#### Brain Development
- Brain continues developing through adolescence
- Depression may affect brain development
- Earlier onset may have greater impact
- Plasticity allows for recovery
- Treatment may normalize some differences

#### Puberty and Hormones
- Depression rates increase after puberty
- Girls > boys after puberty
- Hormonal changes affect mood
- Interacts with stress
- May be sensitive period

## Genetics and Epigenetics

### Heritability
- Moderate heritability (~40-50%)
- Not as heritable as some disorders
- Significant environmental contribution
- Gene-environment interaction
- Polygenic (many genes of small effect)

### Genetic Risk Factors

#### Specific Genes
- **5-HTTLPR**: Serotonin transporter
- **FKBP5**: Stress response
- **BDNF**: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
- **COMT**: Enzyme breaking down dopamine
- Many others with small effects

#### Polygenic Risk
- No single depression gene
- Many genes with small effects
- Polygenic risk scores
- Interactions with environment
- Overlap with other disorders

### Epigenetics
- Environmental effects on gene expression
- Stress can affect gene expression
- Parental depression affects offspring
- Prenatal stress effects
- Potential mechanism of transmission
- May be reversible with intervention

## Comorbidity and Differential Diagnosis

### Co-occurring Disorders

#### Depression + Anxiety
- Most common comorbidity
- Can be difficult to distinguish
- Often anxiety precedes depression
- Shared risk factors
- Shared treatments
- Prognosis worse with both

#### Depression + ADHD
- Overlapping symptoms
- Irritability, concentration problems
- May look like oppositional
- ADHD increases depression risk
- Stimulants may help mood
- Both may need treatment

#### Depression + Disruptive Behavior Disorders
- ODD, conduct disorder
- May appear as anger or defiance
- Depression may masquerade as behavior problems
- Irritability common to both
- Important to diagnose both

#### Depression + Substance Use
- More common in adolescents
- May be self-medicating
- Worsens depression
- Interferes with treatment
- Need to treat both

#### Depression + Medical Illness
- Chronic illness increases risk
- Disease-specific concerns
- Treatment adherence
- Integrated care needed
- Pediatric consultation

### Bipolar Disorder vs. Depression

#### Distinguishing Features
- Bipolar: Manic or hypomanic episodes
- Depression: Unipolar
- Bipolar: Family history of bipolar
- Depression: Family history of unipolar depression
- Bipolar: Psychosis more common
- Bipolar: Earlier onset often

#### Red Flags for Bipolar
- Manic/hypomanic episodes
- Family history of bipolar
- Psychosis with depression
- Rapid mood cycling
- Treatment-resistant depression
- Severe irritability with periods of high mood

## Treatment Resistance

### Defining Treatment Resistance
- Failure to respond to adequate trial of treatment
- Usually defined as failure to respond to:
  - 2 adequate trials of antidepressants, OR
  - 1 adequate trial of CBT

### Assessing Treatment Resistance

#### Was Treatment Adequate?
- Dose sufficient?
- Duration sufficient (8-12 weeks)?
- Adherence?
- Proper delivery of CBT?
- Comorbidities addressed?

#### Reassessment
- Confirm diagnosis
- Reconsider bipolar disorder
- Assess for comorbidities
- Assess for medical causes
- Assess for substance use
- Assess environmental factors
- Assess adherence

### Treatment Strategies for Resistant Depression

#### Pharmacological Strategies
- Switch antidepressant
- Augment with another medication
- Combine antidepressants
- Consider atypical antipsychotic
- Consider lithium (especially if bipolar features)
- Consider MAO inhibitors (rarely in youth)

#### Psychotherapy Strategies
- Switch type of therapy (CBT to IPT or vice versa)
- Increase frequency of therapy
- Add family therapy
- Consider intensive outpatient or PHP
- Consider group therapy

#### Other Treatments
- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): FDA-approved for adolescents 15+
- Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT): Very severe, refractory cases
- Ketamine: Being studied for adolescents
- Omega-3 fatty acids: Some evidence

## Developmental Considerations

- Suicidal ideation more common
- CBT or IPT for adolescents
- Medication more common
- Need for independence vs. support

## Suicide and Self-Harm

### Epidemiology
