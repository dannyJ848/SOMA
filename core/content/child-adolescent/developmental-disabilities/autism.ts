# Understanding Autism Spectrum Disorder

## What Is Autism?

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental difference that affects how a person communicates, interacts with others, and experiences the world around them.

### Key Things to Know
- Autism is called a "spectrum" because it affects people differently
- Every person with autism is unique

- Play-based assessment
- Evaluates social communication, play, repetitive behaviors

#### Parent Interview
- Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R)
- Developmental history
- Current concerns
- Medical history

#### Questionnaires
- Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ)
- Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS)
- Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales
- Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)

### Diagnostic Criteria (DSM-5)

#### Social Communication Differences
- Difficulty with social-emotional reciprocity
- Difficulty with nonverbal communication
- Difficulty developing and maintaining relationships

#### Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors

## Girls with Autism

### Why Girls May Be Missed

# Managing Challenges and Supporting Development

## Sensory Processing Differences

### Understanding Sensory Processing

#### The Eight Senses
1. **Sight**: Visual input
2. **Sound**: Auditory input
3. **Touch**: Tactile input
4. **Taste**: Gustatory input
5. **Smell**: Olfactory input
6. **Vestibular**: Balance and movement
7. **Proprioception**: Body position and movement
8. **Interoception**: Internal body sensations (hunger, thirst, bathroom)

#### Sensory Profiles
- **Hypersensitive** (over-responsive): Bothered by sensory input
- **Hyposensitive** (under-responsive): Seeks sensory input
- **Sensory seeking**: Actively looks for sensory experiences
- **Mixed**: Can be different for different senses

### Strategies for Sensory Challenges

#### For Hypersensitivity
- Reduce unnecessary sensory input
- Create quiet, calm spaces
- Gradual exposure to difficult sensations
- Warn before sensory changes
- Use noise-canceling headphones
- Provide sensory break options
- Respect sensory preferences

#### For Hyposensitivity/Seeking
- Provide appropriate sensory opportunities
- Movement breaks
- Fidget tools
- Heavy work activities
- Chewelry (safe chewing options)
- Exercise balls, trampolines
- Sensory gyms

### Environmental Modifications
- Natural lighting when possible

- **Social stories**: Short stories about social situations
- **Visual rules**: Expectations shown visually
- **Visual timers**: Show how long an activity will last

#### Why Visual Supports Work
- Provide permanent information (don't disappear like words)
- Reduce anxiety by making expectations clear
- Support memory and attention
- Can be referred to repeatedly
- Reduce need for verbal prompting

### Communication Strategies

#### For Verbal Individuals
- Speak clearly and literally
- Avoid idioms and sarcasm
- Allow extra processing time
- Check for understanding
- Use visual supports alongside verbal
- Break instructions into smaller steps
- Write important information down

#### For Minimally Verbal/Nonverbal Individuals

- Pay attention to nonverbal communication

## Behavior Support

### Understanding Behavior

#### Functions of Behavior

- **Sensory**: To get or avoid sensory input
- **Communication**: To communicate a need or want

#### Behavior is Communication
- Always serves a purpose
- Not "being bad"
- Trying to meet a need
- May lack skills to meet needs appropriately

### Preventing Challenging Behavior

- Plan for next time

## Daily Living Skills

### Self-Care Skills

#### Strategies for Teaching

# Autism Research and Advanced Topics

## Genetics and Neurobiology

### Genetic Factors

#### Heritability
- Twin studies show high heritability (70-90%)
- Siblings of autistic individuals have increased risk
- Familial clustering common
- Not purely genetic - environment plays role

#### Genetic Findings
- **Polygenic**: Many genes involved
- **De novo mutations**: New mutations not inherited from parents
- **Inherited variants**: From parents who may not have autism
- **Rare variants**: Large effect sizes
- **Common variants**: Small effect sizes

#### Specific Genetic Conditions Associated with Autism
- Fragile X syndrome
- Tuberous sclerosis
- Rett syndrome (MECP2 mutation)
- PTEN mutations
- 16p11.2 deletion/duplication
- 22q11.2 deletion syndrome
- SYNGAP1 mutations
- Many others (hundreds of genes)

#### Genetic Testing Considerations
- Chromosomal microarray (CMA): First-tier test
- Fragile X testing: Especially for males
- Epilepsy panel: If seizures present
- Whole exome sequencing (WES): If CMA negative
- Genetic counseling recommended

### Neurobiology

#### Brain Structure and Function
- Early brain overgrowth in some (not all)
- Differences in connectivity
- Amygdala differences (emotion processing)
- Cerebellar differences (motor, cognitive functions)
- Mirror neuron system theories (controversial)
- Excitation/inhibition imbalance

#### Neurotransmitter Systems
- **Serotonin**: Elevated in about 30% of autistic individuals
- **GABA**: Inhibitory neurotransmitter, may be deficient
- **Glutamate**: Excitatory neurotransmitter, may be elevated
- **Oxytocin**: Social bonding, being studied

#### The "Intense World" Theory
- Hyper-reactivity to sensory and emotional input
- Local hyper-connectivity
- Long-range under-connectivity
- Leads to intense, overwhelming experiences
- Explains some autistic behaviors

## Etiology and Risk Factors

### Established Risk Factors

#### Genetic Risk Factors
- Sibling with autism
- Parent with subtle autistic traits
- Known genetic syndromes

#### Prenatal and Perinatal Factors
- Advanced parental age (both parents)
- Preterm birth
- Low birth weight
- Certain prenatal exposures
- Maternal infection during pregnancy
- Birth complications leading to hypoxia

### Disproven or Inadequate Evidence

#### Vaccines
- No evidence vaccines cause autism
- Original study linking MMR to autism was fraudulent
- Numerous studies have found no link
- Thimerosal also not linked to autism

#### Parenting
- "Refrigerator mother" theory - completely disproven
- Parenting style does NOT cause autism

#### Other Disproven Theories
- Dietary factors (sugar, additives)
- Gut inflammation (though GI issues common)
- Heavy metal toxicity (except in specific circumstances)

## Diagnostic Considerations

### Differential Diagnosis

#### Conditions That Can Mimic Autism
- Language disorders
- Intellectual disability
- ADHD
- Social anxiety disorder
- Selective mutism
- Hearing loss
- Vision problems
- Trauma/neglect

#### Common Co-occurring Conditions
- **ADHD**: 30-80% co-occurrence
- **Anxiety disorders**: Up to 40%
- **Depression**: Increases with age
- **Epilepsy**: 20-30%
- **Intellectual disability**: 30-50%
- **Sleep disorders**: 50-80%
- **GI disorders**: 46-84%
- **Feeding/eating disorders**: Common

### Autism in Females

#### Why Under-Diagnosed
- May present differently
- Better at masking (camouflaging)
- Different special interests
- More social motivation
- Diagnostic bias in tools

#### Female Autism Phenotype
- Less repetitive behaviors
- Different types of special interests
- More social imitation
- Different play styles
- Higher rates of internalizing disorders
- Often diagnosed later (if at all)

#### Camouflaging
- Consciously mimicking neurotypical behavior
- Exhausting and leads to burnout
- May contribute to mental health issues
- More common in females
- Can delay diagnosis

## Evidence-Based Interventions

### What the Evidence Shows

#### Strong Evidence
- Early intervention improves outcomes
- Behavioral interventions are effective
- Parent-mediated interventions effective
- Joint attention interventions effective
- Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions (NDBI) effective

#### Moderate Evidence
- Social skills groups
- Cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety
- Cognitive behavioral therapy for depression
- Occupational therapy for sensory issues
- Telehealth interventions

#### Limited/No Evidence
- Auditory integration training
- Chelation
- Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
- Secretin
- Most nutritional supplements
- Many complementary and alternative treatments

### Lovaas Model vs. Contemporary ABA

#### Lovaas Model (Historical)
- 40 hours/week of DTT
- Clinic-based
- Focus on reducing autism symptoms
- Some controversial practices

#### Contemporary ABA
- Naturalistic teaching strategies
- Family involvement
- Focus on skills that improve quality of life
- Ethical guidelines
- Assent and consent
- Neurodiversity-informed approaches

## Outcomes and Prognosis
