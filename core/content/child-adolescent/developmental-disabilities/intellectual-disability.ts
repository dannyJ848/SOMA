# Understanding Intellectual Disability

## What Is Intellectual Disability?

Intellectual disability (ID) is a condition that affects a person's ability to learn, problem-solve, and function in daily life. It involves limitations in both:

1. **Intellectual functioning** (learning, reasoning, problem-solving)
2. **Adaptive behavior** (everyday social and practical skills)

### Important Things to Know
- ID is not a disease or illness
- It's a lifelong condition
- It affects each person differently
- People with ID can learn, just at a different pace
- With the right support, people with ID can lead fulfilling lives

## Levels of Intellectual Disability

### Mild Intellectual Disability
- Most common type (about 85% of people with ID)
- Can learn practical skills
- Can read and use math in daily life
- Can live independently with some support
- Can hold jobs
- IQ range: 50-69

### Moderate Intellectual Disability
- Can learn self-care and communication skills
- Can be taught simple academic skills
- Can work with support
- Usually need support in daily living
- May live in group homes or with family
- IQ range: 35-49

### Severe Intellectual Disability
- Limited communication
- Can learn basic self-care
- Needs extensive support
- May need wheelchair or other supports
- Requires highly structured environment
- IQ range: 20-34

### Profound Intellectual Disability
- Very limited understanding
- Needs 24-hour care
- May have limited mobility
- Requires extensive support for all needs
- IQ range: Below 20
