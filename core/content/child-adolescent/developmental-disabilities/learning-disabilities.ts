- 15-20% of students may need this

#### Tier 3: Intensive Intervention
- Individualized or very small group
- More intensive (5x per week or more)
- Progress monitoring weekly or biweekly
- 5% of students may need this
- Potential special education referral

### Research on RTI
- Reduces identification of LDs in some populations
- Improves outcomes for many students
- Earlier identification and intervention
- Reduced disproportionality
- Implementation fidelity critical

## Twice-Exceptional (2e) Learners

### Definition
- Gifted with a learning disability or other disability
- Strengths mask weaknesses
- Weaknesses mask strengths
- Often overlooked

### Identification Challenges
- Gifted identification may miss disabilities
- Disability identification may overlook gifts
- May appear average
- Teacher expectations affect identification
- Comprehensive evaluation essential

### Educational Needs
- Need for both challenge and support
- Acceleration in areas of strength
- Remediation in areas of weakness
- Social-emotional support
- Understanding of asynchrony

### Intervention Considerations
- Focus on strengths
- Teach compensation strategies
- Provide challenge
- Support weaknesses
- Address perfectionism
- Support social development

## Co-Occurring Conditions

### ADHD + LD
- 30-50% co-occurrence
- Attention problems affect learning
- Executive function deficits
- Need for both accommodations
- Medication may help attention

### Anxiety + LD
- Academic anxiety common
- Test anxiety
- School avoidance
- Need for both academic and anxiety support
- CBT for anxiety

### Depression + LD
- Related to academic struggles
- Low self-esteem
- Hopelessness about academic future
- Need for mental health support
- Academic interventions

### Autism + LD
- Common co-occurrence
- Different learning profile
- Need for specialized approaches
- Visual supports helpful
- Social challenges affect learning

## Long-Term Outcomes

### Educational Outcomes
- Increased risk of school dropout
- Lower educational attainment
- Higher rates of special education
- Lower college enrollment (but many do attend)
- Need for accommodations in college

### Employment Outcomes
- Mixed findings
- Some challenges in job market
- Many successful adults with LDs
- Strengths often lead to success
- Self-advocacy skills important

### Psychosocial Outcomes
- Increased risk of low self-esteem
- Higher rates of anxiety and depression
- Social challenges
- BUT: Many successful, happy adults with LDs
- Resilience factors important

### Positive Outcomes
- Many adults with LDs are successful
- Entrepreneurship common
- Creative fields
- Fields that utilize strengths
- Self-awareness important

## Evidence-Based Practices

### Explicit Instruction
- Clear explanation of what and why
- Modeling of skills
- Guided practice with feedback
- Independent practice
- Review and application

#### Research Support
- Effective across content areas
- Especially effective for struggling learners
- Effect sizes 0.6-0.9 (moderate to large)
- Essential for LD

### Strategy Instruction
- Teaching students how to learn
- Cognitive strategies
- Metacognitive strategies
- Self-regulation

#### Research Support
- Effective across ages
- Improves academic performance
- Improves self-efficacy
- Generalization to other areas

### Multisensory Instruction
- Using multiple senses simultaneously
- Visual, auditory, kinesthetic-tactile
- Especially effective for dyslexia

#### Research Support
- Strong evidence for reading
- Also effective for math
- Particularly effective for LD
- Orton-Gillingham approach

### Technology-Assisted Instruction
- Assistive technology
- Educational software/apps
- Online learning
- Universal Design for Learning

#### Research Support
- Mixed results depending on quality
- Most effective with human support
- Assistive technology effective
- UDL promising

## Current Research Directions

### Neuroimaging Studies
- Brain activation patterns
- Response to intervention
- Prediction of outcomes
- Identification markers

### Genetics Research
- Genome-wide association studies
- Gene-environment interaction
- Pharmacogenomics (medication response)
- Earlier identification possibilities

### Intervention Research
- New interventions
- Improving existing interventions
- Technology-based interventions
- Implementation research (how to deliver effectively)

### Longitudinal Studies
- Long-term outcomes
- Factors contributing to success
- Adult outcomes
- Intervention effects over time

## Legal and Policy Considerations

### IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)
- Guarantees free appropriate public education (FAPE)
- Individualized education program (IEP)
- Least restrictive environment (LRE)
- Procedural safeguards
- Due process rights

### Section 504 of Rehabilitation Act
- Prevents discrimination
- Requires accommodations
- Broader than IDEA
- No federal funding

### ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)
- Disability rights law
- Applies to schools, workplaces
- Accommodations required
- Applies to colleges and universities

### Implications
- Rights to accommodations
- Self-advocacy important
- Documentation needed
- Variation in implementation
