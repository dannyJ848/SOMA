# Advanced Adolescent Health Topics

## Substance Use in Adolescents

### Epidemiology
- Alcohol: Most commonly used substance by teens
- Vaping/e-cigarettes: Increased dramatically in recent years
- Marijuana: Use has increased with legalization in some states
- Prescription drugs: Misuse of stimulants, opioids, benzodiazepines
- Illicit drugs: Less common but serious

### Neurodevelopmental Considerations
- Brain development continues until mid-20s
- Prefrontal cortex (judgment, impulse control) develops last
- Substance use during adolescence affects brain development
- Earlier use = higher risk of addiction
- Adolescent brains more sensitive to rewards, less sensitive to risks

### Screening
- **SBIRT** (Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral to Treatment) recommended at all visits
- **CRAFFT** screening tool for adolescent substance use
- Ask about alcohol, marijuana, vaping, prescription drugs, other drugs
- Screen for co-occurring mental health conditions

### Management

#### For At-Risk or Experimental Use
- Motivational interviewing
- Education about risks
- Identify triggers and alternative coping
- Family involvement when appropriate

- **Acamprosate**: Alcohol
- **Buprenorphine**: Opioids
- **Varenicline**: Nicotine

### Vaping-Specific Concerns
- nicotine addiction (most vape pods contain nicotine)

- Unknown long-term effects
- Flavorings appeal to youth
- Gateway to cigarette smoking
- Dual use with cigarettes

- Same effectiveness regardless of BMI
- May interact with hormonal contraceptives

#### Copper IUD
- Most effective emergency contraception (>99%)

## Eating Disorders

### Medical Complications

### Family-Based Treatment (Maudsley Approach)
- Parents take charge of refeeding
- Family not blamed for disorder
- Three phases:
  1. Weight restoration
  2. Returning control to adolescent
  3. Addressing adolescent development
- Most effective treatment for adolescents with anorexia

## ADHD in Adolescents

### Continuing Care
