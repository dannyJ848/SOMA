# Growth & Nutrition in Infancy

## Understanding Growth Charts

### What They Measure
- **Weight-for-age**: How weight compares to other infants
- **Length-for-age**: Height compared to peers
- **Weight-for-length**: Relationship of weight to height
- **Head circumference**: Brain growth indicator

### What's Normal
- Any percentile is normal if steady
- Crossing percentiles may indicate issue
- Breastfed babies grow differently than formula-fed
- Don't compare to other babies

### Growth Patterns
- **0-3 months**: Fastest growth period (about 1 oz/day)
- **3-6 months**: Slows to about 0.5 oz/day
- **6-12 months**: Further slowing, about 0.3 oz/day
- **Tripling birth weight**: By 12 months

## Feeding by Age

### 1-3 Months
- **Breast**: 8-12 times per day on demand
- **Formula**: 2-3 oz every 2-4 hours
- **Total**: About 24-32 oz daily

### 4-6 Months
- **Breast**: 6-8 times per day
- **Formula**: 4-6 oz every 3-4 hours
- **Total**: About 26-32 oz daily
- **Solids**: May begin around 6 months

### 6-12 Months
- **Breast/formula**: Still primary nutrition
- **Solids**: Gradual increase from 1-3 meals daily
- **Milk intake**: 24-30 oz daily plus meals
- **Cup introduction**: Around 6 months

### Iron Needs
- Full-term: Iron stores last 4-6 months

# Advanced Infant Health Management

## Growth Disorders

### Failure to Thrive (FTT)

#### Diagnostic Criteria (at least 1)
- Weight <5th percentile for age
- Weight dropping 2+ major percentiles
- Weight-for-length <5th percentile
- Weight-for-age crossing 2+ percentiles downward

#### Etiology
**Inadequate intake (80% of cases)**
- Breastfeeding difficulties
- Inadequate formula preparation
- Feeding refusal
- Poverty/food insecurity

**Malabsorption**
- Cystic fibrosis
- Celiac disease
- Milk protein allergy
- Pancreatic insufficiency

**Increased metabolic demand**
- Congenital heart disease
- Chronic lung disease
- Recurrent infections
- Hyperthyroidism

#### Evaluation
- Detailed feeding history
- Growth chart analysis (longitudinal)
- Caloric count of intake
- Stool studies if malabsorption suspected
- Screen for lead, anemia, thyroid, celiac

#### Management
- Increase caloric density of feeds
- Address feeding technique
- Treat underlying condition
- Close follow-up weekly to monthly

## Breastfeeding Medicine

### Insufficient Weight Gain in Breastfed Infants

#### Assessment
- Daily weight gain (should be >15-30g/day)
- Output: 6+ wet diapers, 3+ stools daily
- Latch evaluation
- Transfer assessment (weigh before/after feed)

#### Interventions
- Optimize latch and positioning
- Feed more frequently (8-12+ times)
- Ensure complete breast emptying
- Consider galactagogues (fenugreek, domperidone)
- Supplement if needed with pumped milk or formula
- Maternal evaluation for low supply

### Mastitis Management
- Continue breastfeeding (milk not harmful)
- Feed on affected side first
- Empty breast completely
- Supportive care: Rest, fluids, analgesics
- Antibiotics if bacterial infection suspected
- If abscess: Drainage, continue breastfeeding from unaffected side

## Cow's Milk Protein Allergy

### Presentation (non-IgE mediated)
- Blood in stool (hematochezia)
- Loose stools with mucus
- Dermatitis
- Irritability/colic
- Poor growth

### Management
- Maternal elimination diet if breastfeeding
- Extensively hydrolyzed formula if formula-fed
- Amino acid formula if severe
- Soy formula not recommended (<2 years)

### Reintroduction
- Most outgrow by 1 year
- Trial reintroduction at 9-12 months
- Challenge under medical supervision

## Positional Plagiocephaly

### Risk Factors
- Supine sleeping (recommended but causes flat spot)
- Torticollis (neck muscle tightness)
- Preferential head position
- Prematurity
- Multiple gestation

### Prevention
- Tummy time when awake (30+ minutes daily by 4 months)
- Alternate direction in crib
- Hold baby in different arms
- Limit time in containers (swing, bouncer, car seat)

### Treatment
- Repositioning strategies
- Physical therapy if torticollis
- Helmet therapy for severe cases (>12 months)
- Most improve without intervention by 2 years

## Bronchiolitis

### Management Guidelines

#### Indications for Hospitalization
- Oxygen saturation <90% on room air
- Respiratory distress (retractions, grunting)
- Inadequate oral intake
- Apnea
- Underlying lung or heart disease

#### Outpatient Management
- Supportive care only
- Nasal saline and suctioning
- Maintain hydration
- No medications proven beneficial:
  - Bronchodilators not recommended
  - Steroids not beneficial
  - Antibiotics unless bacterial co-infection

#### Contraindicated
- Chest physiotherapy
- Routine chest X-rays
- Routine viral testing (changes management)

## Developmental Surveillance

### Autism Spectrum Disorder Early Signs
By 12 months, concerning for:
- No eye contact or poor eye contact
- No social smiling
- No response to name
- No joint attention (pointing, showing)
- No babbling or loss of babbling
- Fixation on objects rather than people

### Evaluation
- Refer to early intervention if concerns

- Formal developmental evaluation
- Autism-specific evaluation (ADOS, ADI-R)

## Lead Screening

### Universal Screening
- Medicaid: Required at 12 and 24 months
- Private insurance: Risk-based assessment
- Risk factors: Old housing, renovations, imported products

### Levels of Concern
- <5 mcg/dL: No action needed
- 5-9 mcg/dL: Repeat testing, environmental history
- 10-14 mcg/dL: Repeat in 1-3 months, source investigation
- 15-19 mcg/dL: Repeat in 1 month, medical evaluation
- 20-44 mcg/dL: Medical evaluation, chelation considered
- 45+ mcg/dL: Medical management, chelation

## Anemia Screening

### Timing
- Universal screening at 12 months
- Repeat if risk factors

### Causes
- Iron deficiency (most common)
- Hemoglobinopathies
- Chronic blood loss

### Treatment
- Iron supplementation (3-6 mg/kg/day elemental iron)
- Vitamin C to aid absorption
- Repeat hemoglobin in 1 month
- Dietary counseling
