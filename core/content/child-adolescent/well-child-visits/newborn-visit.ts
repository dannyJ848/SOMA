# Your Baby's First Doctor Visit

## When Does It Happen?
Your newborn's first doctor visit usually happens within 3-5 days after leaving the hospital. This is an important time to check on your baby's health and for you to ask questions.

## What the Doctor Will Check
- **Weight**: Making sure your baby is eating well
- **Jaundice**: Yellowing of the skin that may need treatment
- **Feeding**: How breastfeeding or bottle-feeding is going
- **Umbilical cord**: How the belly button is healing
- **Heart and lungs**: Listening for any problems

## What to Bring
- Your baby's hospital records
- A list of questions you have
- Diaper bag with supplies

## Common Questions to Ask
- Is my baby gaining enough weight?
- How often should my baby eat?
- What is normal sleep for a newborn?
- When should I call the doctor?

# Understanding Newborn Health Assessments

## Complete Physical Examination

### Measurements
- **Weight**: Most babies lose 5-10% of birth weight initially, then regain by 2 weeks
- **Length**: Measured to track growth patterns
- **Head circumference**: Important for brain development tracking
- **Temperature**: Should be 97.7°F to 99.5°F (36.5°C to 37.5°C)

### System Checks
- **Heart**: Listening for murmurs or irregular rhythms
- **Lungs**: Checking breathing patterns and clear sounds
- **Hips**: Screening for developmental dysplasia
- **Eyes**: Red reflex test, checking for cataracts
- **Mouth**: Examining palate and tongue-tie

## Newborn Screenings

### Metabolic Screening (Blood Test)
Usually done in hospital, checks for:
- PKU (phenylketonuria)
- Thyroid problems
- Sickle cell disease
- Other metabolic disorders

### Hearing Test
- Important for speech and language development
- If not done in hospital, should be completed by 1 month

## Red Flags to Report
- Fever (100.4°F/38°C or higher)
- Poor feeding or refusal to eat
- Fewer than 6 wet diapers per day
- Yellowing skin that spreads or worsens

# Newborn Development & Milestones

## What Newborns Can Do

### Physical Abilities
- **Reflexes present at birth**:
  - Rooting reflex (turning toward touch on cheek)
  - Suck reflex (essential for feeding)
  - Grasp reflex (holding fingers)
  - Moro reflex (startle response)
  - Stepping reflex (legs "step" when feet touch surface)

### Sensory Development
- **Vision**: Can see 8-12 inches from face, prefers high contrast
- **Hearing**: Recognizes parents' voices, turns toward sounds
- **Smell**: Can recognize mother's scent
- **Touch**: Soothed by skin-to-skin contact

## Sleep Patterns

### What's Normal
- **Total sleep**: 14-17 hours per day
- **Sleep cycles**: Short (2-4 hours)
- **Day/night confusion**: Common in first weeks
- **REM sleep**: About 50% of sleep time (active for brain development)

### Safe Sleep Guidelines
- Always place on back to sleep
- Firm sleep surface
- No loose bedding or toys
- Share room, not bed
- Avoid overheating

## Feeding Development

### Breastfeeding
- 8-12 times per day in first weeks
- Watch for hunger cues (rooting, sucking on hands)
- Weight gain indicates adequate intake
- Dark stools transition to yellow by day 5

### Formula Feeding
- 1-3 ounces every 2-4 hours
- Follow preparation guidelines carefully
- Sterilize bottles for first 3 months

# Medical Management & Prevention

## Immunization Schedule (First 2 Months)

### Hepatitis B
- **First dose**: Usually given at birth
- **Second dose**: 1-2 months
- **Third dose**: 6-18 months

### Why Vaccinate Newborns?
- Newborns have vulnerable immune systems
- Maternal antibodies wane by 2-3 months
- Early protection against serious diseases
- Community immunity protects those who can't be vaccinated

## Vitamin D Supplementation

### Recommendations
- **Breastfed infants**: 400 IU daily from first days of life
- **Formula-fed infants**: May need supplement if consuming less than 32 oz/day
- **Reason**: Breast milk has insufficient vitamin D
- **Duration**: Continue until weaned to vitamin D-fortified milk

### Deficiency Risks
- Rickets (soft bones, deformities)
- Seizures from low calcium
- Poor growth

## Jaundice Management

### Physiologic Jaundice
- Affects 60% of term newborns
- Peaks at day 3-5 of life
- Resolves by 2 weeks

### When to Treat
- Bilirubin levels above age-specific thresholds
- Premature infants have lower treatment thresholds
- Treatment: Phototherapy (blue light)
- Severe cases: Exchange transfusion (rare)

### Risk Factors
- Prematurity
- East Asian ethnicity
- Bruising during delivery
- ABO or Rh incompatibility
- Family history

## Cord Care

### Recommended Approach
- Keep clean and dry
- Fold diaper below cord
- Clean with alcohol or plain water (evidence mixed)
- Signs of infection: redness, swelling, pus, foul odor
- Separation: Usually 1-3 weeks

## Newborn Acne

### Causes
- Maternal hormones
- Usually appears at 2-4 weeks
- Resolves without treatment

### Management
- Clean with water
- Avoid oils or lotions
- Don't squeeze or scrub
- Resolves in weeks to months

# Advanced Topics in Newborn Health

## Growth Monitoring

### WHO Growth Standards
- Based on breastfeeding as norm
- Distinguish from CDC growth charts
- Track weight-for-age, length-for-age, weight-for-length
- Important: Use consistent chart type
- Correct for gestational age if premature

### Failure to Thrive Criteria
- Weight drops below 5th percentile
- Weight-for-age drops 2 major percentiles
- Weight-for-length drops 2 major percentiles

### Growth Patterns
- **Catch-up growth**: Rapid gain in underweight infants
- **Regulatory dysplasia**: Temporary plateau then return to curve
- **Constitutional delay**: Normal but delayed growth

## Breastfeeding Medicine

### Latch Assessment
- Mouth wide open, lips flanged
- Areola visible above, not below
- Chin touching breast, nose slightly away
- Audible swallowing
- No pain for mother

### Common Problems
- **Poor latch**: Leads to nipple pain, poor milk transfer
- **Engorgement**: Feed frequently, cold compresses after
- **Mastitis**: Fever, flu-like symptoms, continue breastfeeding
- **Low supply**: Feed on demand, measure diapers (6+ wet daily)

### Contraindications to Breastfeeding
- Galactosemia (infant)
- HIV (in developed countries)
- Certain medications (chemotherapy, some psychiatric drugs)
- Active tuberculosis (untreated)

## Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip

### Risk Factors
- Female gender
- Breech presentation
- Family history
- Oligohydramnios

### Screening
- Barlow and Ortolani maneuvers at each visit
- Limited abduction = referral
- Ultrasound: <6 weeks for high-risk or abnormal exam
- X-ray: After 4-5 months

### Treatment
- Pavlik harness for infants <6 months
- Closed reduction for older infants
- Surgical correction for delayed diagnosis

## Cardiac Screening

### Pulse Oximetry Screening
- Performed at >24 hours of life
- Detects critical congenital heart disease
- Pass: >95% in both hands and feet, difference <3%
- Fail: <90% or difference >3% on two measurements

### Murmurs in Newborns
- Many innocent murmurs from transitional circulation
- Pathologic murmurs: Harsh, holosystolic, with radiation
- Any murmur with symptoms: Immediate evaluation

## Newborn Seizure Recognition

### Subtle Seizures (Newborn Specific)
- Apneic episodes
- Eye deviations
- Oral-buccal-lingual movements
- Rowing or pedaling movements
- Autonomic changes (heart rate, blood pressure)

### Causes
- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy
- Metabolic disturbances (glucose, calcium, sodium)
- Stroke (arterial ischemic, venous sinus thrombosis)
- Infection (meningitis, encephalitis)
- Genetic disorders

### Evaluation
- EEG for diagnosis
- Neuroimaging: MRI preferred
- Metabolic workup
- Infection studies

## Post-Discharge Considerations

### Car Seat Safety
- Minimum weight requirement (varies by seat)
- Angle indicator to prevent airway obstruction
- Two-hour limit in car seat initially for preemies
- Observation period before discharge for high-risk infants

### SIDS Prevention
- Supine sleeping position
- Breastfeeding (protective)
- Pacifier use (protective after established breastfeeding)
- Avoid overheating
- No smoking exposure
- Room-sharing without bed-sharing
