# Toddler Nutrition & Eating

## Toddler Nutrition Basics

### Daily Calorie Needs (approximately)
- **12-24 months**: 900-1000 calories
- **2-3 years**: 1000-1400 calories

### Key Nutrients
- **Calcium**: 700 mg daily (milk, yogurt, cheese)
- **Iron**: 7 mg daily (meats, beans, fortified cereals)
- **Vitamin D**: 600 IU daily
- **Fiber**: 19 g daily (fruits, vegetables, whole grains)

## What Toddlers Should Eat Daily

### Milk and Dairy (2-3 servings)
- 16-24 oz of whole milk (until 2 years)
- Switch to low-fat milk at 2 years if growing well
- Yogurt, cheese

### Grains (6 servings)
- Whole grains preferred
- Bread, pasta, rice, cereal
- Oatmeal, whole grain pancakes

### Fruits and Vegetables (5 servings)
- Variety of colors
- Fresh, frozen, or canned (no sugar added)
- Cut into small pieces to prevent choking

### Protein (2 servings)
- Meat, poultry, fish
- Eggs, beans, tofu
- Peanut butter (thin layer)

## Managing Picky Eating

### What's Normal
- Fear of new foods (food neophobia)
- Preferring familiar foods
- Eating well one day, poorly the next
- Having "food jags" (wanting same food repeatedly)

### Strategies That Work
- Offer 3 meals and 2-3 snacks at regular times
- Let child decide how much to eat
- Serve family meals, child eats same food
- No "short-order cooking" special meals
- Offer new foods multiple times (10-15 exposures)
- Make food appealing, not pressure
- Eat together as a family

### Strategies to Avoid
- Force feeding or bribery
- Using dessert as reward
- Letting child fill up on juice/milk
- Allowing grazing all day
- Making mealtimes stressful

## Choking Hazards

### Foods to Avoid or Modify
- Whole grapes (cut in quarters)
- Hot dogs (cut lengthwise then crosswise)
- Nuts and seeds (wait until 4+ years)
- Popcorn (wait until 4+ years)
- Hard candy (wait until 4+ years)
- Raw carrots (cook until soft)
- Large chunks of food
- Spoonfuls of peanut butter (thin layer only)

## Juice Guidelines

### Recommendations
- No juice before 12 months
- 4 oz or less daily for 1-3 years
- 100% fruit juice only
- Serve with meals, not sipping all day
- Whole fruit is always better

### Why Limit Juice
- High sugar, low fiber
- Can fill child up, reduce appetite for food
- Linked to dental problems
- Associated with excess weight gain

## Vitamin Supplements

### Who Needs Them
- Picky eaters who don't eat well consistently
- Children with restricted diets
- Those with little sun exposure (vitamin D)

### Common Supplements
- Multivitamin with iron (if needed)
- Vitamin D if intake is low
- No megadoses needed

## Special Situations

### Milk Allergy/Intolerance
- Fortified soy milk as alternative
- Other fortified plant milks (check labels)
- Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D

### Vegetarian/Vegan Diets
- Can be healthy with careful planning
- Need B12 supplement for vegans
- Focus on protein, iron, zinc, calcium

# Toddler Behavior & Discipline

## Understanding Toddler Behavior

### Why Toddlers Behave This Way
- Limited impulse control (prefrontal cortex developing)
- Want independence but still need parents
- Frustration when can't communicate wants
- Testing limits to learn boundaries
- Difficulty regulating emotions
- Desire for control

### Normal vs. Concerning

#### Normal Behavior
- Occasional tantrums (2-6 per day at peak)
- Saying "no" frequently
- Not sharing (developmentally normal)
- Separation anxiety
- Attachment to objects (blanket, toy)
- Regression during stress

#### Concerning Behavior
- Aggression toward others or self
- Extreme opposition (over 50% of interactions)
- No interest in interacting with others
- No eye contact or response to name
- Loss of skills
- Persistent behavior problems across settings

## Positive Discipline Strategies

### Foundation
- Consistency is key
- Positive attention for good behavior (5:1 ratio)
- Clear, simple rules
- Age-appropriate expectations
- Remain calm when correcting

### Techniques That Work

#### Prevention
- Set up environment for success
- Give choices (this or that, not yes/no)
- Give warnings before transitions
- Keep routines predictable
- Make sure needs are met (sleep, hunger)

#### During Misbehavior
- Get down to child's level
- Use calm, firm voice
- Brief explanation ("hitting hurts")
- Natural consequences
- Redirect to appropriate activity
- Time-out or time-in (1 minute per year)

#### After Misbehavior
- Reconnect when calm
- Practice better behavior
- Praise improvements
- Don't hold grudges

## Managing Tantrums

### Before Tantrums
- Learn triggers (hunger, fatigue, overstimulation)
- Watch for early signs
- Address needs before meltdown

### During Tantrums
- Stay calm (your emotion affects theirs)
- Ensure safety
- Don't give in to demand
- Don't reason during tantrum (brain offline)
- Wait it out nearby
- Offer comfort if child seeks it

### After Tantrums
- Don't lecture
- Reconnect
- Name emotions ("you were frustrated")
- Move on

### When Tantrums Are Concerning
- Last >30 minutes frequently
- Self-injury or aggression
- Occur many times daily beyond age 3

- Can sit still for 2-5 minutes

### Training Approach
- Wait for readiness signs
- Use positive reinforcement (praise, stickers)
- Don't pressure or shame
- Expect accidents (normal)
- Train sitting first, standing later
- Night dryness comes later (may take until 5+ years)

### Common Problems
- Regression (stress, new baby, illness)
- Withholding (pain from constipation)
- Fear of potty
- Refusal
- Nighttime wetting (bedwetting normal until 5+ years)

#### Management
- Usually self-limited
- During seizure: Ensure safety, don't restrain, don't put anything in mouth
- Emergency care if: >5 minutes, breathing difficulty, injury
- Treatment: Fever control doesn't prevent, may consider diazepam for recurrent

#### Prognosis
- Simple: Excellent, slightly increased risk of epilepsy later
- Complex: Higher risk of subsequent epilepsy

### Epilepsy
- Two or more unprovoked seizures
- EEG for diagnosis and classification
- Neuroimaging if abnormal exam or focal findings
