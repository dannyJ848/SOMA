      summary: "Self-advocacy means speaking up for yourself at doctor visits. You have the right to ask questions, share your concerns, and be part of decisions about your health.",
      explanation: `**What Is Self-Advocacy?**
Self-advocacy means standing up for yourself when it comes to your health. You are the expert on how you feel, and it is important to share that with your doctors and nurses!

**Why Is Speaking Up Important?**
- You know your body better than anyone
- Doctors cannot read your mind
- Speaking up helps prevent mistakes
- Your opinions matter in your care
- You deserve to understand your treatment

**Your Rights as a Patient:**
You have the right to:
- Ask questions until you understand
- Get a second opinion
- Know about all your treatment options
- Refuse treatment you do not want
- See your medical records
- Have your privacy protected
- Have an interpreter if needed

**How to Speak Up:**

*If You Do Not Understand:*
- "Can you explain that in simpler words?"
- "I am confused. Can you say that again?"
- "Can you write that down for me?"

*If Something Feels Wrong:*
- "This does not feel right to me."
- "I am worried about this."
- "Can we talk about other options?"

*If You Need More Time:*
- "I need time to think about this."
- "Can I come back after I discuss this with my family?"

**Bringing Support:**
It is okay to bring someone with you:
- A family member
- A friend
- A patient advocate
They can help you remember things and speak up for you.

**Before You Leave:**
Make sure you know:
- What is wrong (your diagnosis)
- What you need to do
- What medicines to take
- Warning signs to watch for
- When to come back

**Remember:** It is YOUR body and YOUR health. Do not be afraid to speak up!`,

      summary: "Patient self-advocacy encompasses health-related self-determination, effective communication, and navigation of healthcare systems. It requires knowledge, skills, and confidence to participate meaningfully in shared decision-making and ensure receipt of appropriate, patient-centered care.",
      explanation: `**Conceptual Framework for Self-Advocacy:**

Self-advocacy in healthcare involves three interconnected domains:
1. **Self-determination** - Autonomous decision-making about health
2. **Self-representation** - Communicating needs and preferences
3. **Self-regulation** - Managing emotions and behaviors in healthcare contexts

**Patient Activation:**

The concept of patient activation measures knowledge, skills, and confidence:
- Level 1: Passive recipient
- Level 2: Gaining knowledge
- Level 3: Taking action
- Level 4: Maintaining behaviors

**Rights and Regulatory Framework:**

*Federal Protections:*
- Patient Bill of Rights (CMS Conditions of Participation)
- HIPAA Privacy Rule
- Americans with Disabilities Act
- Section 1557 (nondiscrimination)

*State-Level Rights:*
- Informed consent statutes
- Medical records access laws
- Advance directive legislation
- Patient advocate requirements

**Advocacy Skills Development:**

      level: 4,
      summary: "Patient self-advocacy represents a critical competency in the healthcare consumer role, requiring health literacy, communication skills, knowledge of rights, and systems navigation abilities to effectively participate in shared decision-making and ensure receipt of high-quality, patient-centered care.",
