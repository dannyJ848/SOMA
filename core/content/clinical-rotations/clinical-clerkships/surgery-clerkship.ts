1. **Preparation is Everything:** Know your patients, know the anatomy, know the procedure. Preparation is the foundation of surgical excellence.

2. **Technical Skills Matter:** Invest in developing hands-on skills. Practice knot tying until it is automatic. Simulation time is well spent.

3. **Surgical Culture is Real:** Early arrival, thorough preparation, and tireless engagement are expected. Embrace these values rather than resisting them.

4. **Stay Engaged in the OR:** Long cases test stamina. Find ways to stay mentally present - focus on anatomy, anticipate steps, ask questions when appropriate.

5. **Own Your Patients:** Follow them from admission through discharge. Know their progress better than anyone. This ownership is the hallmark of surgical thinking.

6. **Read Every Day:** Even when exhausted, read something about tomorrow's cases. This knowledge compounds over the rotation.

7. **Seek OR Feedback:** Ask surgeons directly: "What could I do better in the OR?" This shows maturity and commitment.

8. **Handle the Hours:** Surgery rotations are demanding. Prioritize sleep, exercise, and nutrition. Sustainable performance beats heroic burnout.

9. **Learn from Complications:** Every complication teaches something. Approach M&M conferences as learning opportunities, not punitive exercises.

10. **Decide About Surgery:** This rotation helps you decide if surgery is right for you. Engage fully to make an informed decision.`,
