      summary: 'Pre-rounding is when medical students and doctors check on their patients before the team meets for rounds, gathering information to present and discuss the patient\'s care.',
      explanation: `## What Is Pre-Rounding?

Pre-rounding is when you check on your patients early in the morning before the medical team meets together for rounds. It\'s like doing your homework before class.

## Why Pre-Rounding Matters

**Benefits of Good Pre-Rounding:**
- You know how your patients did overnight
- You can answer questions from your team
- You help make better decisions about patient care
- You show you are responsible and prepared

## When to Pre-Round

**Typical Schedule:**
- Usually 1-2 hours before rounds start
- Many teams round at 8:00 or 9:00 AM
- So pre-rounding often starts at 6:00 or 7:00 AM

## What to Do During Pre-Rounding

**1. Check the Computer:**
- Look at overnight vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate)
- Check for new lab results
- See if there were any problems overnight
- Review new medications given

**2. See Your Patient:**
- Ask how they slept
- Ask about any new symptoms or problems
- Do a focused physical exam
- Check if they are better, worse, or the same

**3. Prepare Your Presentation:**
- Think about what you will tell the team
- Write down important information
- Prepare your plan for the day

## Information to Gather

**For Each Patient:**
- Vital signs (are they stable?)
- Any problems overnight (pain, fever, etc.)
- New test results
- Current medications
- Plan for the day

## Tips for Success

**Be Organized:**
- Have a system for checking each patient
- Bring a notepad or use your phone to take notes
- Keep track of which patients you have seen

**Be Thorough:**
- Don\'t skip steps even when busy
- If something seems wrong, investigate
- Ask nurses if there were any issues overnight

**Be Efficient:**
- Have a routine that works for you
- Balance speed with thoroughness
- Practice to get faster over time

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Not checking vital signs trends
- Forgetting to ask about overnight events
- Not examining the patient
- Being unprepared to answer questions
- Running late to rounds`,
