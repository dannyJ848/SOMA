Community health workers (CHWs) are trusted members of the community who help people
stay healthy and get the care they need. In many Latino communities, they are called
"promotores de salud," which means "health promoters." Think of a CHW as a bridge
between the community and the healthcare system — just like a bridge connects two
sides of a river, a CHW connects people to doctors, clinics, and health information.

CHWs come from the same neighborhoods as the people they serve. They speak the same
language, understand the same culture, and face many of the same challenges. This is
what makes them so effective. When a neighbor you trust tells you about a free clinic
or helps you understand your medications, you are more likely to listen and follow
through.

The role of a CHW can include many different tasks. Some CHWs visit people at home to
check on their health. Others teach classes about nutrition, exercise, or managing
diabetes. Some help people fill out forms for insurance or find food assistance. The
common thread is that CHWs work to improve health in their communities by meeting
people where they are — literally and figuratively.

Think of the healthcare system like a big, complicated building with many doors. A CHW
is like a guide who knows which door to open, who to talk to inside, and how to help
you find your way. Without that guide, many people get lost, give up, or never even
try to enter the building.

CHWs are not doctors or nurses, but they are an important part of the healthcare team.
They fill a gap that medical professionals often cannot — they have the time, the
trust, and the cultural understanding to truly connect with community members. Research
has shown that communities with active CHW programs have better health outcomes,
including lower rates of diabetes complications, fewer emergency room visits, and
higher rates of preventive screenings.

To become a CHW, many states offer certification programs. These programs teach skills
like health education, communication, advocacy, and basic health knowledge. Some
programs require a certain number of training hours and supervised field experience.
The certification process helps ensure that CHWs have the knowledge and skills they
need to do their work safely and effectively.

The scope of a CHW's work is defined by their training and the organization they work
with. CHWs do not diagnose diseases, prescribe medications, or perform medical
procedures. Instead, they focus on prevention, education, support, and connecting
people with the right resources. Knowing the boundaries of the role is just as
important as knowing the responsibilities.

Community health workers (CHWs) occupy a unique and increasingly recognized role
within the public health workforce. Known by many titles — promotores de salud,
community health representatives, lay health advisors, patient navigators — CHWs
serve as vital links between underserved populations and the healthcare systems
designed to serve them.

The CHW model is rooted in the understanding that health is shaped not only by
medical care but also by social, economic, and environmental factors. CHWs address
these broader determinants of health by working directly in communities, often in
settings far removed from traditional clinical environments. They conduct home
visits, facilitate group education sessions, organize community events, and provide
one-on-one support to individuals navigating complex health and social service
systems.

The American Public Health Association (APHA) defines a CHW as "a frontline public
health worker who is a trusted member of and/or has an unusually close understanding
of the community served." This definition emphasizes two core qualities: trust and
proximity. CHWs are effective precisely because they share cultural backgrounds,
languages, and life experiences with the people they serve.

Core competencies for CHWs typically include communication skills, interpersonal
skills, service coordination and navigation, capacity building, advocacy, education
and facilitation, individual and community assessment, outreach, and professional
skills and conduct. These competencies are defined by national organizations such
as the Community Health Worker Core Consensus (C3) Project and are used as the
foundation for state certification programs.

As of recent years, more than 20 states have established CHW certification programs,
and the trend continues to grow. Certification requirements vary by state but
generally include a combination of classroom instruction (ranging from 80 to 160
hours), supervised field experience, and in some cases, a competency exam. Some
states also require continuing education to maintain certification.

The integration of CHWs into healthcare teams has been supported by an expanding
evidence base. Studies have demonstrated that CHW interventions can reduce
hemoglobin A1c levels in diabetic patients, improve blood pressure control,
increase cancer screening rates, and reduce hospital readmissions. These outcomes
have led to growing support for sustainable financing mechanisms, including
Medicaid reimbursement for CHW services in several states.

CHWs operate within a defined scope of practice that distinguishes their role from
that of licensed healthcare professionals. They do not diagnose, prescribe, or
treat medical conditions. Instead, they focus on prevention, education, advocacy,
and navigation. Understanding and respecting this scope is essential for
maintaining the integrity of the profession and ensuring client safety.

The CHW workforce is diverse, reflecting the communities served. Many CHWs are
bilingual and bicultural, with strong roots in immigrant, refugee, or historically
marginalized populations. This diversity is a strength of the profession,
enabling CHWs to reach populations that traditional healthcare workers often
cannot.

Professional development opportunities for CHWs continue to expand, including
specialty certifications in areas such as diabetes education, mental health first
aid, and chronic disease self-management. Professional associations at the state
and national level provide networking, advocacy, and continuing education
resources for CHWs seeking to advance their careers.

      content: `
The community health worker (CHW) workforce represents one of the fastest-growing
segments of the public health labor force in the United States. The Bureau of
Labor Statistics projects significant growth in the CHW occupation, driven by
expanding recognition of the role's value in addressing health disparities and
improving population health outcomes.

Historically, CHWs have operated in a variety of settings, including community-based
organizations, federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), local health departments,
hospitals, managed care organizations, and faith-based institutions. The diversity
of employment settings reflects the flexibility of the CHW role and its
applicability across the healthcare continuum, from primary prevention to chronic
disease management and care transitions.

The theoretical foundations of the CHW model draw from multiple frameworks,
including the social-ecological model, the health belief model, social cognitive
theory, and community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles. CHWs
operate at multiple levels of the social-ecological model — individual,
interpersonal, organizational, community, and policy — making them uniquely
positioned to address health determinants across these domains.

The evidence base for CHW effectiveness has grown substantially. Systematic
reviews and meta-analyses have documented the impact of CHW interventions on
a wide range of outcomes. In diabetes management, CHW-led programs have been
associated with mean reductions in HbA1c of 0.5-1.0 percentage points. In
cardiovascular health, CHW interventions have demonstrated significant
improvements in blood pressure control and medication adherence. In maternal
and child health, CHW home visiting programs have been linked to improved
prenatal care utilization, increased breastfeeding rates, and reduced preterm
birth rates.

The economic case for CHW programs has also been established through cost-
effectiveness analyses and return-on-investment studies. The Penn Center for
Community Health Workers developed the IMPaCT model, which demonstrated a
return of $2.47 for every $1 invested through reductions in hospital
utilization. Similar analyses across programs have shown positive returns,
particularly when CHW interventions target high-risk, high-cost populations.

Workforce development for CHWs involves several interconnected systems. State
certification programs establish minimum competency standards and create a
recognized professional credential. Academic pathways, including community
college certificate and associate degree programs, provide structured
educational opportunities. Employer-based training programs offer role-specific
preparation tailored to organizational needs. Continuing education requirements
ensure ongoing professional development.

The integration of CHWs into clinical care teams raises important considerations
regarding supervision, documentation, and workflow design. Effective integration
models include collaborative practice agreements, regular team meetings,
electronic health record (EHR) access for CHW documentation, and structured
referral pathways between clinical and community-based services. The challenge
of integrating a community-based workforce into clinical settings requires
attention to organizational culture, role clarity, and mutual respect across
professional disciplines.

Sustainable financing for CHW programs remains a critical challenge. While
Medicaid reimbursement has expanded, the landscape is fragmented, with
significant variation across states in covered services, billing codes,
and reimbursement rates. Additional financing mechanisms include grant funding,
managed care contracts, value-based payment arrangements, and philanthropic
support. The transition from grant-dependent to sustainably financed CHW
programs is a priority for the field.

Quality assurance and program evaluation are essential components of CHW
program management. Standardized measures, such as those developed by the
National Association of Community Health Workers (NACHW) and included in
the Uniform Data System (UDS) for FQHCs, support consistent data collection
and benchmarking. Process measures (number of encounters, referrals made),
outcome measures (clinical indicators, utilization data), and patient-reported
outcomes all contribute to a comprehensive evaluation framework.

      content: `
The design, implementation, and sustainability of community health worker (CHW)
programs require a sophisticated understanding of workforce policy, organizational
dynamics, and the intersection of public health practice with healthcare delivery
systems. Graduate-level analysis of the CHW workforce encompasses program design
frameworks, supervisory models, policy advocacy strategies, and the structural
determinants that shape workforce development.

Program design for CHW interventions should begin with a thorough community needs
assessment and stakeholder engagement process. The logic model framework is a
widely used tool for articulating program theory, linking inputs (staffing,
training, resources) to activities (home visits, group education, care
coordination), outputs (number of clients served, referrals completed), and
outcomes (improved clinical indicators, reduced utilization, enhanced quality
of life). Program design should also address the dose and intensity of
interventions, target population characteristics, and mechanisms for
adaptation to local context.

Supervision of CHWs presents unique challenges that differ from traditional
clinical supervision models. Effective CHW supervision requires a balance
between administrative oversight (timekeeping, documentation, compliance)
and supportive supervision (skill development, emotional support, reflective
practice). The literature distinguishes between direct supervision by clinical
staff, peer supervision among CHWs, and hybrid models that combine both
approaches. The supervisor-CHW relationship is critical to workforce retention,
professional development, and program quality.

The role of the CHW supervisor requires specific competencies, including
understanding of the CHW scope of practice, cultural humility, community
engagement skills, and the ability to navigate the tension between clinical
and community-based paradigms. Supervisors who over-medicalize the CHW role
or fail to value community-based expertise risk undermining the very qualities
that make CHWs effective.

Workforce policy considerations include credentialing frameworks, labor
standards, compensation equity, and career advancement pathways. The
professionalization of the CHW workforce has generated debate within the
field. Proponents argue that certification, standardized training, and
formal credentials enhance quality, accountability, and sustainability.
Critics caution that excessive credentialing requirements may create barriers
to entry for community members with deep cultural knowledge but limited
formal education, potentially undermining the community-based nature of the
role.

Compensation remains a persistent challenge. CHWs are often among the lowest-
paid members of healthcare teams, with median hourly wages significantly
below those of other health workers. Wage disparities are compounded by
factors such as part-time employment, lack of benefits, and limited
advancement opportunities. Advocacy for living wages, comprehensive
benefits, and career ladders is essential for workforce stability and
reflects the justice principles underlying the CHW movement.

The policy landscape for CHW workforce development is shaped by federal,
state, and local actors. Key federal initiatives include the Health
Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) community health workforce
programs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state and
local health department partnerships, and the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) guidance on Medicaid coverage of CHW services.
State-level policies govern certification requirements, scope of practice
definitions, and Medicaid reimbursement structures.

Advanced program evaluation methodologies are essential for demonstrating
CHW program value and informing continuous improvement. Randomized controlled
trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental designs, and implementation science
frameworks (such as RE-AIM and CFIR) provide rigorous approaches to
evaluating program effectiveness, reach, adoption, and sustainability.
Mixed-methods approaches that combine quantitative outcome data with
qualitative insights into program processes and participant experiences
offer the most comprehensive understanding of program impact.

The integration of CHWs into digital health ecosystems represents an
emerging area of practice and research. CHWs are increasingly using
mobile health (mHealth) applications, telehealth platforms, and electronic
health records to support their work. The design of these technologies
should account for CHW workflow, digital literacy, language preferences,
and the community-based nature of their work. Technology should augment
rather than replace the relational core of CHW practice.

Ethical considerations in CHW practice include confidentiality and privacy
protections (particularly when CHWs live in the same communities as their
clients), informed consent for data collection and sharing, dual
relationships (serving community members who are also neighbors, friends,
or family), and the ethical implications of data collection in vulnerable
communities. CHW training programs should include substantive ethics
content that addresses these issues in culturally relevant ways.

The community health worker (CHW) profession stands at a critical inflection
point in its evolution within the United States healthcare landscape. For
professionals engaged in workforce development, health systems leadership,
policy advocacy, and implementation science, the field presents complex
challenges related to sustainable financing, workforce standardization,
health system integration, and the preservation of the community-based
identity that defines the profession.

The political economy of CHW workforce development reflects broader tensions
in healthcare between standardization and community responsiveness, between
professionalization and accessibility, and between evidence-based practice
and cultural knowledge. These tensions are not merely academic — they have
direct implications for how CHW programs are designed, financed, evaluated,
and sustained.

Financing sustainability requires a multi-payer, multi-mechanism approach.
The current landscape includes fee-for-service Medicaid billing (using
Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes, particularly under the
"incident to" provision or through state plan amendments and 1115 waivers),
managed care organization contracts that include CHW services as part of
population health management strategies, value-based payment arrangements
that reward providers for outcomes to which CHWs contribute, Section 1905(a)
preventive services coverage, and braided funding models that combine
clinical revenue with grant and philanthropic support.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has provided
increasingly supportive guidance for states seeking to finance CHW services
through Medicaid. The 2013 CMS informational bulletin clarified that states
may cover preventive services recommended by a physician or licensed
practitioner and provided by a CHW. Subsequent guidance has expanded the
understanding of permissible financing mechanisms, but significant state-
level variation persists, creating a fragmented policy landscape.

Workforce standardization efforts must navigate the tension between quality
assurance and community authenticity. The National Association of Community
Health Workers (NACHW) has emerged as a leading voice in this dialogue,
advocating for CHW-led policy development and centering the perspectives
of CHWs themselves in decisions about credentialing, scope of practice,
and training standards. The principle of "nothing about us without us" is
fundamental to this approach.

Research frontiers in CHW science include several high-priority areas.
Implementation science methodologies are being applied to understand the
contextual factors that influence CHW program adoption and fidelity across
diverse settings. Comparative effectiveness research seeks to identify
which CHW intervention models work best for which populations and
conditions. Health equity research examines how CHW programs can be
designed to explicitly address structural racism, economic inequality,
and other root causes of health disparities. Mixed-methods and
participatory research approaches are particularly well-suited to the
complexity of CHW practice.

The measurement and attribution of CHW impact present methodological
challenges. CHW interventions operate through multiple, often simultaneous
mechanisms — information transfer, emotional support, system navigation,
social capital building, and community empowerment. Traditional clinical
outcome measures may not fully capture the breadth of CHW impact. Patient-
reported outcomes, social needs measures, community-level indicators, and
process measures are needed to complement clinical metrics and provide a
more complete picture of program value.

The intersection of CHW practice with digital health innovation creates
both opportunities and challenges. Artificial intelligence, predictive
analytics, and automated population health management tools can potentially
enhance CHW effectiveness by improving targeting, risk stratification, and
care coordination. However, the introduction of these technologies must be
guided by principles of equity, transparency, community consent, and the
primacy of the human relationship in CHW practice.

Global perspectives on community health workers provide valuable insights
for the U.S. context. CHW programs in countries such as Brazil (agentes
comunitarios de saude), Ethiopia (health extension workers), and India
(accredited social health activists, or ASHAs) offer lessons on workforce
scaling, government integration, and community empowerment. The World
Health Organization's guidelines on health policy and system support to
optimize CHW programs provide an international framework for program
design and evaluation.

Looking ahead, the CHW profession must address several strategic questions.
How can workforce growth be sustained and financed beyond grant cycles?
How can health systems integrate CHWs without co-opting or devaluing their
community-based identity? How can certification and training standards
ensure quality without creating exclusionary barriers? How can research
methodologies be adapted to capture the full spectrum of CHW impact? And
how can the CHW movement advance health equity at the structural and
systemic levels, not merely at the individual and interpersonal levels?

The answers to these questions will shape the trajectory of the CHW
profession and, by extension, the capacity of the U.S. healthcare system
to address the persistent and widening disparities that undermine
population health.
