      summary: "Dry eye syndrome occurs when your eyes don't make enough tears or the tears evaporate too quickly. This makes your eyes feel uncomfortable, gritty, or like something is in them.",
      explanation: `Think of your eyes like a garden. Just as plants need water to stay healthy, your eyes need tears to stay moist and comfortable. Tears lubricate the eyes, wash away debris, and protect against infection.

When your eyes are too dry, they feel:
- Sandy or gritty (like sand in the eye)
- Burning or stinging
- Itchy
- Tired or heavy
- Like something is stuck in them
- Sensitive to light
- Blurry vision that clears with blinking

**What causes dry eyes?**

Your eyes might be dry because:
1. **Not enough tears** - Your body doesn't produce enough tear fluid
2. **Tears evaporate too fast** - Your tears don't have the right oil layer to keep them from drying out
3. **Poor tear quality** - Your tears lack important components

**Common causes:**
- Getting older (tear production decreases)
- Computer use and screen time (we blink less when focusing)
- Dry air or wind
- Air conditioning or heating
- Certain medications (antihistamines, decongestants, antidepressants)
- Hormonal changes (menopause, pregnancy)
- Medical conditions (diabetes, thyroid problems, rheumatoid arthritis)
- Eye surgery (LASIK)
- Contact lens wear
- Smoking
- Not blinking enough (reading, computer work)

**How are dry eyes diagnosed?**
- Eye exam looking at tear film
- Special tests to measure tear production
- Tests to check tear quality
- Exam with special dyes to see dry spots on the eye

**How are dry eyes treated?**

**Simple things to try first:**
- Artificial tears (eye drops) from the drugstore
- Blink more often, especially when using screens
- Take breaks when reading or using computer (20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds)
- Use a humidifier in dry rooms
- Drink plenty of water
- Wear sunglasses outside to block wind
- Avoid smoke and other irritants

**Medical treatments:**
- Preservative-free artificial tears
- Eye drops that help you make more tears
- Tiny plugs that block tear drainage (punctal plugs)
- Prescription eye drops (Restasis, Xiidra)
- Antibiotics for eyelid inflammation
- LipiFlow thermal treatment for blocked oil glands

**Remember:**
- Dry eye is a chronic condition - it usually can't be cured, only managed
- Using artificial tears regularly is important, even when your eyes don't feel dry
- Treating dry eye protects your cornea and maintains good vision`,

      summary: 'Dry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disorder of the tear film and ocular surface resulting in symptoms of discomfort, visual disturbance, and tear film instability. It is classified as aqueous deficient ( decreased tear production) or evaporative (excessive tear evaporation), with both mechanisms often present simultaneously.',
      explanation: `## Anatomy of the Tear Film

**Three Layers of Tear Film:**

1. **Mucin Layer (innermost):**
   - Produced by conjunctival goblet cells
   - Anchors tear film to cornea
   - Provides smooth optical surface

2. **Aqueous Layer (middle):**
   - Produced by lacrimal glands
   - Makes up 98% of tear volume
   - Contains water, electrolytes, proteins

3. **Lipid Layer (outermost):**
   - Produced by meibomian glands
   - Prevents evaporation
   - Provides smooth surface

## Classification of Dry Eye

**1. Aqueous Deficient Dry Eye (ADDE):**
- Decreased tear production
- Lacrimal gland dysfunction

      clinicalNotes: `Key clinical pearls for dry eye:

1. **Preservative-free tears for chronic use** - Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) toxicity worsens dry eye. Use preservative-free drops if using >4 times daily.

2. **Treat MGD aggressively** - Most dry eye is evaporative from meibomian gland dysfunction. Warm compresses, lid hygiene, and consider oral doxycycline.

3. **Don't undertreat inflammation** - Dry eye is an inflammatory disease. Use cyclosporine or lifitegrast early. Steroid bridge can jumpstart response.

4. **Punctal plugs are effective** - Underutilized option for aqueous deficient dry eye. Consider before escalating to more aggressive therapies.

5. **Refractory cases need re-evaluation** - If not responding, reconsider diagnosis. Look for neuropathic pain, medication effects, comorbidities.

6. **Pre-treat before refractive surgery** - Optimize dry eye before LASIK/PRK. Punctal plugs and aggressive therapy reduce postoperative dryness.

7. **Blepharitis and dry eye go together** - Treat lid disease concurrently with dry eye. Lid hygiene, warm compresses, consider oral doxycycline.

8. **Screen for Sjögren** - In aqueous deficient dry eye, consider Sjögren evaluation (ANA, SSA/SSB, rheumatology referral, lip biopsy).`,

      summary: "Contemporary dry eye management integrates DEWS II framework, individualized therapy based on etiology and severity, and emerging biomarkers and therapeutics. Understanding the vicious cycle of hyperosmolarity and inflammation guides treatment selection, while special populations require tailored approaches. Ongoing research aims to improve diagnostics and develop targeted therapies.",
      explanation: `## Evidence-Based Practice

**DEWS II Framework:**

**Definition:**
"Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by ocular surface symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles."

**Key Concepts:**
- Tear film instability is central
- Hyperosmolarity is core mechanism
- Inflammation perpetuates disease
- Neurosensory abnormalities contribute
- Symptoms and signs may not correlate

**Etiologic Classification:**

**Aqueous Deficient:**
- Sjögren syndrome-related
- Non-Sjögren
- **Most severe aqueous deficiency = Sjögren**

**Evaporative:**
- Meibomian gland dysfunction (most common)
- Disorder of eyelid aperture
- Low blink rate
- Mucin deficiency
- **Most common overall = MGD**

**Mixed:**
- Both aqueous deficient and evaporative
- **Most patients have mixed disease**

## Diagnostic Algorithms

**Stepwise Approach:**

1. **Symptom Assessment**
   - OSDI questionnaire
   - Dry eye symptoms present?

2. **Sign Assessment**
   - TBUT <10 seconds?
   - Positive staining?
   - Low Schirmer?
   - Abnormal osmolarity?

3. **Classification**
   - Aqueous deficient vs evaporative
   - Meibomian gland assessment
   - Grading of severity

4. **Etiology Search**
   - Medication review
   - Autoimmune screening
   - Environmental factors
   - Systemic diseases

**Red Flags for Sjögren:**
- Severe aqueous deficiency
- Positive autoantibodies
- Systemic symptoms
- Consider rheumatology referral
- Salivary gland biopsy

## Treatment Evidence

**Artificial Tears:**
- Lubricating eye drops improve symptoms
- Preservative-free preferred
- No head-to-head comparisons
- Choose based on patient preference

**Cyclosporine:**
- Multiple RCTs show benefit
- Increases tear production
- Reduces surface staining
- Takes 3-6 months for full effect
- Long-term data supports continued use

**Lifitegrast:**
- FDA approved 2016
- Four RCTs show benefit
- Faster onset than cyclosporine
- Similar efficacy to cyclosporine
- BID dosing

**Omega-3 Supplements:**
- DREAM study (2023): No benefit over placebo
- Earlier studies suggested benefit
- May still benefit MGD
- Not recommended as first-line

**Punctal Plugs:**
- Multiple studies show benefit
- Similar efficacy to cyclosporine
- Cost-effective
- Complication rate ~15%

**LipiFlow:**
- RCTs show gland improvement
- Symptom benefit modest
- Cost-effectiveness unclear
- Variable insurance coverage

**IPL for Dry Eye:**
- Several RCTs show benefit
- Particularly for MGD
- Long-term data emerging
- Requires multiple treatments

## Emerging Therapies

**Novel Pharmacologics:**
- NOVA333 (rebamipide prodrug)
- Tyrvaya (varenicline nasal spray)
  - Nasal neurostimulation
  - FDA approved 2021
  - Increases tear production
- Diquafosol (P2Y2 agonist) - Japan/Asia
- Rebamipide (mucin secretagogue) - Japan/Asia

**Anti-Inflammatory Targets:**
- LFA-1 antagonists (lifitegrast class)
- Integrin antagonists
- Novel cyclosporine formulations
- Tacrolimus ophthalmic

**Device-Based Therapies:**
- Nasal neurostimulation (Tyrvaya)
- Thermal pulsation (LipiFlow alternatives)
- RF devices (TempSure Envi)
- Neurostimulation (TrueTear - discontinued)

**Regenerative Approaches:**
- Autologous serum
- Platelet-rich plasma
- Cord blood serum
- Amniotic membrane
- Stem cell therapy (future)

## Special Situations Management

**Pregnancy and Lactation:**
- Artificial tears safe
- Avoid most medications
- Punctal plugs safe
- Autologous serum possible
- Avoid NSAIDs, steroids

**Pediatric Dry Eye:**
- Screen time increase
- Allergic conjunctivitis
- Congenital disorders
- Preservative-free tears
- Address environmental factors

**Elderly Patients:**
- Polypharmacy
- Multiple comorbidities
- More severe disease
- Preservative-free preferred
- Consider cognitive factors

**Contact Lens Intolerance:**
- Switch to daily disposables
- Preservative-free solutions
- Treat underlying dry eye
- Consider permanent refractive surgery

**Glaucoma with Dry Eye:**
- Preserved drops worsen dry eye
- Switch to preservative-free
- Consider SLT/laser
- Surgical options if severe

## Controversies and Future Directions

**Omega-3 Supplementation:**
- DREAM study negative
- Earlier studies positive
- May benefit specific subgroups
- Not first-line recommendation

**Treating Asymptomatic Dry Eye:**
- Signs without symptoms
- Observation acceptable
- Prevent future damage?
- Individualize

**Antibiotics for MGD:**
- Doxycycline commonly used
- Anti-inflammatory properties
- Azithromycin alternative
- Evidence limited but practice common

**Restasis vs. Generic Cyclosporine:**
- Multiple generics available
- Some formulations differ
- Patient preference important
- Insurance coverage varies

**Testing Protocols:**
- osmolarity: expensive, limited availability
- MMP-9: point of care, limited use
- No consensus on routine testing
- Clinical diagnosis often sufficient

**Future Directions:**
- Biomarker discovery
- Precision medicine approaches
- Gene therapy possibilities
- Neuro-regeneration
- New drug targets`,

      clinicalNotes: `Advanced clinical pearls:

1. **DEWS II is the framework** - Understand the vicious cycle of hyperosmolarity, instability, and inflammation. Treat the cycle, not just symptoms.

2. **Preservative-free is key** - BAK toxicity is real. Use preservative-free drops for any chronic use (>4 times daily). This is non-negotiable.

3. **MGD is most common** - Most dry eye is evaporative from meibomian gland dysfunction. Look for gland dropout, express glands, treat aggressively.

4. **Anti-inflammatory is essential** - Dry eye is inflammatory. Use cyclosporine or lifitegrast early. Consider steroid bridge for faster relief.

5. **Punctal plugs underutilized** - Simple, effective for aqueous deficiency. Consider before escalating to more expensive/complex therapies.

6. **Screen for Sjögren** - In severe aqueous deficiency, think Sjögren. Check ANA, SSA/SSB, refer to rheumatology if indicated.

7. **Refractory needs re-evaluation** - If not responding, reconsider diagnosis. Neuropathic pain, wrong diagnosis, or comorbidities may be present.

8. **Medication review mandatory** - Many drugs worsen dry eye. Review all medications, consider alternatives. B preserved glaucoma drops are common culprits.`,
