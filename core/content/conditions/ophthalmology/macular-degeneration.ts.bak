      summary: "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye condition that damages the macula, the part of the eye responsible for sharp central vision. It is a leading cause of vision loss in older adults.",
      explanation: `Think of your eye like a camera. The macula is the part of the "film" (retina) at the back of your eye that captures the center of what you see. When you have AMD, this central area gets damaged.

**What is the macula?**
- The macula is a small area at the center of your retina
- It gives you sharp, detailed central vision
- It lets you see faces, read, drive, and recognize colors
- AMD does NOT cause complete blindness - peripheral (side) vision is usually preserved

**Types of AMD:**

1. **Dry AMD (most common):**
   - Drusen (tiny yellow deposits) build up under the macula
   - Vision changes happen slowly over years
   - No treatment currently, but vitamins may help slow it
   - Can progress to wet AMD

2. **Wet AMD (more serious):**
   - Abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula
   - These vessels leak blood and fluid
   - Vision loss can happen suddenly (days to weeks)
   - Requires urgent treatment with eye injections to prevent blindness

**What causes AMD?**
- Getting older (most important risk factor)
- Smoking doubles your risk
- Family history
- Being Caucasian
- High blood pressure, high cholesterol
- Obesity

**Warning Signs of AMD:**
- Blurred central vision
- Straight lines appear wavy
- Dark or empty spots in center of vision
- Colors seem less bright
- Difficulty reading or recognizing faces

**How is AMD diagnosed?**
- Eye exam looking at the back of the eye
- Special photographs of the retina
- Amsler grid test (check for wavy lines)
- OCT scan (like ultrasound for the eye)

**How is AMD treated?**

**Dry AMD:**
- AREDS2 vitamin supplements may slow progression
- Eating leafy greens, fish, and nuts
- Not smoking
- Wearing UV protection sunglasses
- Monitoring vision at home with an Amsler grid

**Wet AMD:**
- Anti-VEGF injections into the eye (e.g., Avastin, Lucentis, Eylea)
- Injections are given regularly (monthly or every few months)
- Can't restore vision already lost, but can prevent further loss
- Sometimes laser treatment is used

**Remember:**
- Early detection is critical
- Wet AMD needs treatment quickly to save vision
- Dry AMD has no cure but healthy habits help
- Use an Amsler grid at home to monitor your vision`,

      summary: 'Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative condition affecting the macula, causing progressive central vision loss. It is classified as dry (atrophic) or wet (exudative/neovascular), with wet AMD involving choroidal neovascularization and requiring anti-VEGF therapy to prevent severe vision loss.',
      explanation: `## Anatomy and Function

**The Macula:**
- Located at the posterior pole of the eye
- Approximately 5.5 mm in diameter
- Contains highest concentration of photoreceptors (cones)
- Fovea: central depression with thinnest retina, best visual acuity
- Responsible for:
  - Central, high-acuity vision (20/20 or better)
  - Color vision
  - Fine detail perception
  - Reading and face recognition

**Pathophysiology Overview:**
- Aging changes in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)
- Bruch membrane thickening
- Drusen accumulation
- Photoreceptor dysfunction and death
- In wet AMD: abnormal blood vessel growth (choroidal neovascularization)

## Types and Stages of AMD

**Dry AMD (Atrophic/Non-Exudative):**
- Accounts for 80-90% of cases
- Drusen accumulation under RPE
- Geographic atrophy (GA) in advanced stages
- Vision loss usually gradual
- No FDA-approved treatment for GA (as of 2023)

**Stages of Dry AMD:**
1. **Early AMD:**
   - Multiple small drusen or few medium-sized drusen
   - Usually no symptoms
   - No vision loss

2. **Intermediate AMD:**
   - Many medium-sized drusen or one or more large drusen
   - May have mild vision changes
   - May notice changes in quality of vision

3. **Advanced Dry AMD (Geographic Atrophy):**
   - Large areas of RPE and photoreceptor loss
   - Well-demarcated areas of atrophy
   - Significant central vision loss
   - May progress to wet AMD

**Wet AMD (Exudative/Neovascular):**
- Accounts for 10-20% of AMD cases
- 90% of AMD-related blindness
- Choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
- Fluid leakage, hemorrhage, fibrosis
- Sudden or rapid vision loss
- Treatable with anti-VEGF injections

## Risk Factors

**Non-modifiable:**
- Age: prevalence increases from <2% at age 50-59 to >30% at age >75
- Genetics: CFH, ARMS2/HTRA1 genes
- Race: more common in Caucasians
- Gender: slightly more common in females

**Modifiable:**
- Smoking: 2-4x increased risk, dose-dependent
- Obesity: increases progression risk
- Diet: low in antioxidants, leafy greens, fish
- Cardiovascular disease: hypertension, hypercholesterolemia
- Sun exposure: UV and blue light

## Clinical Features

**Symptoms:**
- Gradual or sudden central vision blurring
- Metamorphopsia (straight lines appear wavy)
- Scotoma (central blind spot)
- Difficulty reading or recognizing faces
- Reduced color perception
- Micropsia (objects appear smaller) or macropsia

**Signs:**
- Drusen on fundus exam (yellowish retinal lesions)
- RPE changes (hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation)
- Geographic atrophy (well-defined areas of atrophy)
- Subretinal fluid/hemorrhage (wet AMD)
- Subretinal fibrosis/scar (disciform scar)

## Diagnostic Testing

**Amsler Grid:**
- Grid of straight lines with central fixation dot
- Patient covers one eye, stares at dot
- Positive if lines appear wavy, distorted, or missing areas
- Simple home monitoring tool

**Fundoscopy:**
- Direct or indirect ophthalmoscopy
- Slit lamp biomicroscopy with lenses
- Identify drusen, RPE changes, fluid, hemorrhage

**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):**
- Cross-sectional imaging of retina
- Detects intraretinal and subretinal fluid
- Measures retinal thickness
- Identifies drusen, geographic atrophy
- Essential for monitoring wet AMD treatment response

**Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF):**
- Visualizes lipofuscin accumulation
- Maps geographic atrophy
- RPE health assessment

**Fluorescein Angiography (FA):**
- IV fluorescein dye injection
- Serial retinal photographs
- Identifies leakage (wet AMD)
- Characterizes CNV (classic vs occult)

**Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICG):**
- Better visualization of choroidal circulation
- Identifies polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)
- Helpful when FA inconclusive

**AREDS Classification System:**

| Category | Drusen | Other Changes | Risk of Progression to Advanced AMD |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1 | None or few small | None | <5% |
| 2 | Multiple small or at least 1 intermediate | None | ~10% |
| 3 | Extensive intermediate, or at least 1 large | None in each eye | ~25% |
| 4 | Advanced AMD in one eye | Vision loss due to AMD | ~50% in fellow eye |

## Treatment

   - Used only for lesions away from fovea

**Emerging Treatments:**
- Complement inhibitors for geographic atrophy
- Gene therapy for sustained anti-VEGF delivery
- Port delivery systems for long-term drug release
- Neuroprotective agents

## Prognosis

**Dry AMD:**
- Slow progression
- Variable rate of vision loss
- Risk of conversion to wet AMD: ~10% per year with intermediate/advanced
- Geographic atrophy causes progressive central vision loss

**Wet AMD:**
- Untreated: rapid progression to legal blindness within 2 years
- Treated: 30-40% gain vision, 50% stable, 10% continue to lose
- Requires long-term, possibly indefinite treatment
- CNV may become fibrotic and less responsive over time

**Monitoring:**
- Regular eye exams (every 6-12 months for dry AMD)
- Amsler grid at home weekly
- Prompt evaluation for any vision changes`,

      summary: "Age-related macular degeneration involves degenerative changes in Bruch membrane, RPE dysfunction, and photoreceptor loss. Wet AMD is characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV) with leakage and hemorrhage, requiring anti-VEGF therapy. Diagnosis relies on multimodal imaging including OCT, FA, and FAF.",
      explanation: `## Pathophysiology

**Normal Macular Anatomy:**
- Retina: 10 layers of neural tissue
- Photoreceptors: rods (peripheral) and cones (macula)
- Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE): monolayer beneath photoreceptors
- Bruch membrane: elastic layer between RPE and choroid
- Choroid: vascular layer providing oxygen and nutrients
- Choriocapillaris: capillary network adjacent to Bruch membrane

**Aging Changes in AMD:**

1. **Bruch Membrane Changes:**
   - Lipid and protein accumulation
   - Thickening and decreased permeability
   - Calcification and drusen formation
   - Diffuse deposits (basal laminar, basal linear)

2. **RPE Dysfunction:**
   - Lipofuscin accumulation (A2E)
   - Impaired phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments
   - Reduced metabolic transport
   - Cellular senescence and death

3. **Choriocapillaris Atrophy:**
   - Reduced blood flow
   - Capillary dropout
   - Ischemia contributing to degeneration

**Drusen Pathogenesis:**
- Accumulation of extracellular deposits
- Complement activation and inflammation
- Lipid and protein aggregation
- Oxidative damage
- Genetic susceptibility (CFH, C3, CFI variants)

**Angiogenesis in Wet AMD:**

1. **VEGF Upregulation:**
   - Hypoxia from RPE/choroidal dysfunction
   - Inflammation (complement, macrophages)
   - Oxidative stress
   - VEGF-A isoforms promote vascular permeability and endothelial proliferation

2. **Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV):**
   - Type 1: Sub-RPE (occult)
   - Type 2: Subretinal (classic)
   - Type 3: Retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP)
   - Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)

**Complement System in AMD:**
- Chronic inflammation at macula
- CFH Y402H polymorphism increases risk
- Uncontrolled complement activation
- Drusen contain complement components
- Rationale for complement inhibitor therapy

## Imaging and Diagnosis

**Optical Coherence Tomography:**

**Findings in Dry AMD:**
- Drusen appear as RPE elevations
- Hyperreflective material between RPE and Bruch membrane
- RPE thinning in geographic atrophy
- Choroidal hypertransmission in atrophic areas

**Findings in Wet AMD:**
- Intraretinal fluid (cystoid macular edema)
- Subretinal fluid (serous detachment)
- Subretinal hyperreflective material (blood/fibrosis)
- Pigment epithelial detachments (PED)
- Disruption of ellipsoid zone

**OCT Angiography (OCTA):**
- Non-invasive visualization of vasculature
- Detects CNV without dye injection
- Flow voids in non-perfusion areas
- Useful for monitoring treatment response

**Fluorescein Angiography Patterns:**

**CNV Types:**
1. **Classic CNV:**
   - Well-demarcated hyperfluorescence
   - Early lacy network, late leakage
   - Better response to treatment

2. **Occult CNV:**
   - Poorly defined leakage
   - Late staining without clear boundaries
   - Fibrovascular PED

3. **Minimally Classic:**
   - Both classic and occult components
   - <50% classic component

**FA Stages:**
- Pre-arterial (choroidal filling)
- Arterial (retinal arteries fill)
- Early venous (arteriovenous transit)
- Late venous (venous laminar flow)
- Recirculation (leakage evident)

**Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICGA):**
- Better choroidal visualization
- Polypoidal lesions in PCV (hot spots)
- Branching vascular network
- Plaques and staining

**Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF):**
- Hyperautofluorescence: lipofuscin accumulation (foci at risk)
- Hypoautofluorescence: RPE atrophy (geographic atrophy)
- Patterns: focal, banded, diffuse

## Classification Systems

**AREDS2 Simplified Severity Scale:**
- Based on drusen size and presence of pigmentary changes
- 5-step scale predicting progression risk
- Useful for patient counseling

**Beckman Initiative Classification:**

3. **Intermediate AMD:**
   - Large drusen (≥125 µm)
   - Any large drusen with pigment changes

4. **Late AMD:**
   - Geographic atrophy
   - Neovascular AMD

**CT Categories (based on drusen volume on OCT):**

## Geographic Atrophy

**Pathophysiology:**
- Progressive RPE and photoreceptor loss
- Enlarging atrophic lesions
- Foveal involvement causes central vision loss
- No proven treatment (complement inhibitors in trials)

**Patterns:**
- Banded atrophy around drusen
- Focal patches
- Diffuse atrophy

**Prognosis:**
- Median growth rate: 0.5-1.0 mm²/year
- Extrafoveal lesions: vision preserved until fovea involved

      clinicalNotes: `Clinical pearls for AMD management:

1. **Genetics matter** - Ask about family history. First-degree relatives have 3-4x increased risk. Consider earlier screening.

2. **Smoking is critical** - Current smokers have 2-4x risk. Cessation is the most important modifiable risk factor.

3. **AREDS2 for intermediate AMD** - Recommend AREDS2 vitamins for bilateral intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye.

4. **Amsler grid at home** - Teach patients to use weekly. Cover one eye, look at central dot. Report wavy lines immediately.

5. **Treat-and-extend is standard** - Reduces burden while maintaining outcomes. Most patients can be extended to 8-12 week intervals.

6. **Bilateral disease needs attention** - If one eye has wet AMD, the fellow eye is at high risk. Monitor closely.

7. **GA therapies are available** - Pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad slow GA progression but don't restore vision. Discuss with appropriate patients.

8. **PCV requires ICG** - In patients of Asian ancestry or poor anti-VEGF response, consider ICG to rule out PCV. PDT may be needed.`,

      summary: "Contemporary AMD management integrates genetic risk assessment, advanced multimodal imaging, and precision anti-VEGF therapy. Emerging complement inhibitors for geographic atrophy and novel delivery systems aim to reduce treatment burden. Individualized approaches based on phenotype, response patterns, and patient factors optimize long-term outcomes.",
      explanation: `## Evidence-Based Medicine and Clinical Trials

**Landmark Trials:**

**AREDS and AREDS2:**
- AREDS (2001): Antioxidants + zinc reduced 5-year risk of advanced AMD by 25%
- AREDS2 (2013): Lutein/zeaxanthin non-inferior to beta-carotene; safer for smokers
- Population: bilateral intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye

**Anti-VEGF Pivotal Trials:**

| Trial | Drug | Comparator | Result |
|-------|------|------------|--------|
| MARINA | Ranibizumab monthly | Sham | +15 letters ETDRS |
| ANCHOR | Ranibizumab monthly | PDT | +11 letters |
| PIER | Ranibizumab quarterly | Sham | Initial gain then loss |
| PrONTO | Ranibizumab PRN | Monthly | Similar with fewer injections |
| CATT | Ranibizumab vs Bevacizumab | Head-to-head | Similar efficacy |
| VIEW 1/2 | Aflibercept q8wk | Ranibizumab monthly | Non-inferior |
| HAWK/HARRIER | Brolucizumab q12wk | Aflibercept q8wk | Non-inferior |
| TENAYA/LUCERNE | Faricimab q16wk | Aflibercept q8wk | Non-inferior |

**Key Insights:**
- Monthly dosing provides best outcomes
- PRN and TAE can maintain vision with fewer injections
- Bevacizumab cost-effective with similar efficacy
- Longer-acting agents reduce burden

**Geographic Atrophy Trials:**

**Pegcetacoplan (OAKS, DERBY):**
- Monthly: 17-22% reduction in GA growth
- EOM: 12-16% reduction
- Benefit increased over time
- Subgroup: extrafoveal lesions benefited most

**Avacincaptad (GATHER2):**
- Monthly: 14% reduction in GA growth
- Clean safety profile
- Approved 2023

**Complement Inhibitor Failures:**
- Lampalizumab (anti-factor D): Phase 3 negative
- APL-2 (pegcetacoplan) modest benefit
- Eculizumab: negative

**Interpretation:**
- Complement inhibition slows but does not stop GA
- Better for extrafoveal lesions
- Early treatment may be more beneficial

## Pharmacogenomics and Precision Medicine

**Genotype-Guided Therapy:**

**CFH and ARMS2:**
- High-risk genotypes progress faster
- May influence AREDS2 response
- Not yet standard for treatment decisions

**Pharmacogenomics of Anti-VEGF:**
- VEGF gene polymorphisms may affect response
- Not clinically actionable currently

**Biomarker Development:**
- Proteomic signatures for progression risk
- Genetic risk scores for screening intervals
- Imaging biomarkers for treatment response

## Treatment Algorithm Optimization

**Newly Diagnosed Wet AMD:**

**Induction Phase:**
- 3 monthly loading doses
- Consider 4th dose if residual fluid
- Assess response with OCT and VA

**Maintenance Phase:**
- TAE preferred for most patients
- Extend by 2-week increments
- Maximum interval typically 10-12 weeks
- Re-treat if fluid recurs

**Patient Factors Influencing Choice:**
- Age and life expectancy
- Comorbidities (anticoagulation, mobility)
- Social support and transportation
- Treatment preferences
- Cost considerations

**Refractory Disease Management:**

**Definition:**
- Persistent fluid on OCT after ≥6 anti-VEGF injections
- Or vision loss despite treatment

**Diagnostic Re-evaluation:**
1. Confirm diagnosis (multimodal imaging)
2. Rule out mimics (CSCR, PCV, RAP)
3. Assess compliance
4. Check for fibrosis/atrophy

**Therapeutic Options:**
1. Switch anti-VEGF agent
2. Shorten interval
3. Consider PDT for PCV
4. Combination therapy
5. High-dose regimens

**Dry AMD Monitoring:**

**Intermediate AMD:**
- Eye exams every 6-12 months
- AREDS2 vitamins
- Home Amsler grid
- OCT monitoring (annually)

**Advanced Dry AMD (Geographic Atrophy):**
- Monitor for foveal involvement
- Consider complement inhibitors
- Discuss low vision rehabilitation
- Monitor fellow eye for wet AMD

      ],
      clinicalNotes: `Advanced clinical pearls:

1. **Treat-and-extend is the new standard** - Reduces visit burden while maintaining vision. Most patients stabilize at 8-12 week intervals. Start with 3 monthly doses, then extend by 2 weeks if dry.

2. **Switch anti-VEGF for incomplete response** - If persistent fluid after 6+ injections, consider switching agents. Each has different binding characteristics (bevacizumab/all VEGF, ranibizumab/VEGF-A, aflibercept/VEGF-A + PlGF).

3. **PCV requires special attention** - In Asian patients or those with poor anti-VEGF response, get ICG. PDT combined with anti-VEGF is more effective than anti-VEGF alone.

4. **Fellow eyes need monitoring** - If one eye has wet AMD, the fellow eye is at high risk (10-15% per year). Educate patients on Amsler grid and prompt reporting.

5. **AREDS2 for intermediate AMD** - Recommend for bilateral intermediate AMD or advanced AMD in one eye. Use lutein/zeaxanthin formulation (no beta-carotene) for smokers.

6. **GA treatments are available** - Pegcetacoplan and avacincaptad slow GA progression but do not restore vision. Best for extrafoveal GA or patients with bilateral disease. Discuss risks/benefits.

7. **Consider clinical trials** - Many AMD trials available. Gene therapy may reduce burden in future. Consider referral for eligible patients.

8. **Don't forget psychosocial impact** - AMD causes depression and isolation. Refer to low vision services early. Support groups and rehabilitation can improve quality of life.`,
