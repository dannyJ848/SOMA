      summary: "Retinal detachment is a serious eye condition where the retina (the light-sensing tissue at the back of the eye) pulls away from its normal position. It is a medical emergency that can cause permanent vision loss if not treated quickly.",
      explanation: `Think of your eye like a camera, with the retina being the film that captures images. When the retina detaches, it's like the film peeling away from the back of the camera. Without the retina in its proper place, the eye can't capture clear images.

**Why is retinal detachment dangerous?**

The retina needs to be attached to the back of the eye to work properly. When it detaches:
- It doesn't get the oxygen and nutrients it needs
- The photoreceptor cells (that capture light) start to die
- Vision is lost in the detached area
- **This is a medical emergency** - the sooner it's treated, the better the chances of saving vision

**Types of retinal detachment:**

1. **Rhegmatogenous (most common):**
   - A tear or hole in the retina
   - Fluid seeps behind the retina
   - Retina pulls away from the back of the eye
   - Usually happens with aging

2. **Tractional:**
   - Scar tissue pulls on the retina
   - Common in people with diabetes
   - Scar tissue grows on the retina and pulls it loose

3. **Exudative:**
   - Fluid leaks behind the retina
   - No tear or hole
   - Caused by other eye diseases or inflammation

**Warning Signs of Retinal Detachment:**

**IMPORTANT:** You may have no pain at all, but watch for:
- **Flashes of light** (like lightning streaks in your vision)
- **New floaters** (spots, cobwebs, or specks floating in your vision)
- **A curtain or shadow** moving across your field of vision
- **Sudden blurring of vision**
- **Sudden loss of peripheral (side) vision**

**Who is at risk?**
- Age over 50 (more common as we age)
- Nearsightedness (myopia)
- Previous retinal detachment in one eye
- Family history of retinal detachment
- Eye injury or trauma
- Previous eye surgery (especially cataract surgery)
- Diabetes (for tractional detachment)

**How is retinal detachment diagnosed?**
- Dilated eye exam (eye doctor uses drops to widen pupils)
- Special examination of the retina
- Ultrasound of the eye (if cataract or bleeding blocks view)

**How is retinal detachment treated?**

**Most retinal detachments need surgery:**

1. **Pneumatic Retinopexy:**
   - Gas bubble injected into the eye
   - Pushes retina back into place
   - Laser or freezing treatment seals the tear
   - Patient must position head in specific way

2. **Scleral Buckle:**
   - Small band placed around the eye
   - Gently pushes the eye wall toward the retina
   - Helps retina reattach

3. **Vitrectomy:**
   - Removes vitreous gel from inside the eye
   - Repairs the detachment
   - Replaces gel with gas or oil bubble

**Recovery:**
- Vision may take months to fully recover
- Some vision may not return
- Success rate is high with prompt treatment
- Follow-up care is critical

**Remember:**
- This is a medical emergency
- Seek immediate care if you have symptoms
- Quick treatment improves outcomes
- Regular eye exams can catch problems early`,

      summary: 'Retinal detachment is separation of the neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium. Rhegmatogenous RD (RRD), caused by retinal break with fluid accumulation, is the most common type and requires urgent surgical repair. Tractional and exudative RD have different mechanisms and management approaches.',
      explanation: `## Anatomy and Pathophysiology

**Normal Retinal Attachment:**
- Retina attached to RPE (retinal pigment epithelium)
- RPE provides nutrition and removes waste
- Vitreous gel fills center of eye, loosely attached to retina

**Mechanisms of Detachment:**

1. **Rhegmatogenous (RRD):**
   - Retinal break (tear or hole)
   - Liquified vitreous passes through break
   - Fluid accumulates between retina and RPE
   - Gravity-dependent spread

2. **Tractional (TRD):**
   - Vitreoretinal adhesions pull on retina
   - Fibrotic membranes contract
   - No retinal break
   - Associated with diabetes, trauma, inflammation

3. **Exudative (Serous):**
   - Fluid accumulation from other causes
   - No retinal break
   - RPE or choroidal vascular problem
   - Inflammation, tumor, vascular leakage

## Clinical Features

**Symptoms of Rhegmatogenous RD:**

**Prodromal (Posterior Vitreous Detachment):**
- Flashes of light (photopsia)
- New floaters
- May last days to weeks before detachment

**Retinal Detachment:**
- Dark curtain or shadow moving across vision
- Peripheral vision loss first
- Central vision loss as macula detaches
- Blurred vision
- No pain (usually)

**Timing is Critical:**

- Macula-off: Macula already detached, repair within days to weeks

**Risk Factors:**

**Myopia:**
- Nearsightedness
- Longer eye shape
- Thinner peripheral retina
- More lattice degeneration
- Higher lifetime risk

**Age:**
- Peak incidence 50-70 years
- Vitreous liquefaction with age
- PVD more common

**Previous RD in Fellow Eye:**
- 10-15% risk in second eye
- Lifelong monitoring needed

**Cataract Surgery:**
- Capsular rent, vitreous loss increases risk
- YAG laser capsulotomy small risk
- Risk persists for years after surgery

**Trauma:**
- Penetrating or blunt injury
- Delayed presentation possible
- Associated with other ocular injuries

**Family History:**
- Genetic predisposition
- Lattice degeneration
- High myopia in families

**Other Risk Factors:**
- Lattice degeneration (thinned retina)

      summary: 'Retinal detachment involves separation of neurosensory retina from RPE, with rhegmatogenous (retinal break with fluid ingress), tractional (fibrovascular proliferation), and exudative (fluid accumulation without break) subtypes. Urgent surgical intervention with pneumatic retinopexy, scleral buckle, or vitrectomy is required for rhegmatogenous detachment to prevent permanent vision loss.',
      explanation: `## Detailed Pathophysiology

**Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment:**

**Sequence of Events:**

1. **Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD):**
   - Vitreous liquefaction (synchysis)
   - Vitreous detachment from retina (syneresis)
   - Age-related, occurs in most people by age 70
   - Usually asymptomatic
   - May cause flashes and floaters

2. **Retinal Break Formation:**
   - Dynamic vitreoretinal traction during PVD
   - Break at site of firm vitreoretinal adhesion
   - Horseshoe tear: U-shaped with operculum
   - Operculated tear: Round with free flap
   - Atrophic hole: Thinned retina, full-thickness defect

3. **Fluid ingress:**
   - Liquified vitreous enters subretinal space
   - Detachment spreads from break
   - Gravity-dependent (fluid tracks inferiorly)
   - Retina loses attachment, nutrition

4. **Retinal Dysfunction:**
   - Separation from RPE choroidal blood supply
   - Photoreceptor hypoxia, ischemia
   - Cell death begins in days
   - Irreversible if prolonged

**Vitreoretinal Adhesions:**
- Strongest at vitreous base
- Lattice degeneration: Thin retina, strong adhesion
- Optic disc, vessels, macula
- Sites of tear formation during PVD

**Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR):**
- Major cause of surgical failure
- Cellular proliferation on retinal surfaces
- Membrane formation, contraction
- Retinal stiffness, foreshortening
- Causes recurrent detachment

**Tractional Retinal Detachment:**

**Pathogenesis:**
- Fibrovascular membranes form on retinal surface
- Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) driven
- Neovascularization from ischemic retina
- Membranes contract, pulling retina
- No retinal break (initially)
- Can break secondarily, become combined

**Etiologies:**
- **Diabetic retinopathy:** Most common cause
- **Proliferative sickle cell retinopathy**
- **Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)**
- **Trauma:** Penetrating injury
- **Uveitis:** Inflammatory membranes
- **Eales disease**

**Exudative Retinal Detachment:**

**Pathophysiology:**
- Fluid accumulation without break
- Increased vascular permeability
- RPE pump dysfunction
- Hydrostatic or osmotic imbalance

**Causes:**
- **Vascular:**
  - Central serous chorioretinopathy
  - Uveal effusion syndrome
  - Hypertensive choroidopathy
  - Coat disease
- **Inflammatory:**
  - Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease
  - Posterior scleritis
  - Uveitis
- **Neoplastic:**
  - Choroidal melanoma
  - Metastatic tumors
  - Choroidal hemangioma
- **Iatrogenic:**
  - Surgery complications
  - Medication effects

## Diagnostic Evaluation

- Peripheral, brief, flashing lights
- More prominent in dark adaptation

**Floaters:**
- Vitreous condensations
- Hemorrhage (tobacco dust)
- Pigment cells (RPE)
- Weiss ring: PVD ring
- New onset = urgent evaluation

- May be difficult with small pupil, media opacity

**Slit Lamp Biomicroscopy:**
- 78D, 90D lenses for panoramic view
- Examination of anterior vitreous
- Look for Schaffer sign (pigment)
- Assess for PVD

**B-Scan Ultrasound:**
- Indicated when media opacity limits view
- Cornea, lens opacity, vitreous hemorrhage
- Shows retinal elevation, mobility
- Localizes breaks (difficult)
- Assesses vitreous status
- Rules out choroidal mass

**OCT:**

| Silicone oil | Indefinite | Complex, PVR, trauma |

**Advantages of PPV:**
- Direct visualization
- Removes vitreous traction
- Relieves media opacity
- Handles complex RDs

**Disadvantages:**
- Cataract progression (nearly 100%)
- Intraocular surgery risks
- Silicone oil needs removal
- More expensive

**Combined Procedures:**

      clinicalNotes: `Key clinical pearls for retinal detachment:

1. **Time is retina** - Macula-on detachments are emergencies. Repair within 24-48 hours for best outcomes. Macula-off still needs prompt repair but less urgent.

2. **Flashes and floaters are red flags** - New onset flashes and floaters need urgent evaluation. PVD with symptoms has 15% retinal tear risk.

3. **Always examine both eyes** - The fellow eye is at risk. Look for lattice degeneration, atrophic holes, retinal tears.

4. **Indentation is essential** - Without scleral depression, you miss 20-30% of peripheral breaks. Learn this technique.

5. **Ultrasound when you can"t see** - Don"t guess when media is opaque. B-scan ultrasound is invaluable for diagnosis and surgical planning.

6. **Treat according to findings** - Don't use same approach for all RDs. Single break vs multiple, macula-on vs off, phakic vs pseudophakic all matter.

7. **PVR is the enemy** - Proliferative vitreoretinopathy causes most failures. Early surgery before PVR develops improves outcomes.

8. **Patient education saves vision** - Teach patients the warning signs. Flashes, floaters, or curtains need immediate evaluation.`,

      summary: "Contemporary retinal detachment management integrates advanced imaging, microsurgical techniques, and individualized surgical approaches based on break characteristics and ocular findings. Understanding vitreoretinal pathology, PVR mechanisms, and prognostic factors enables optimal outcomes. Emerging technologies and techniques continue to improve success rates for this vision-threatening condition.",
      explanation: `## Evidence-Based Surgical Approaches

**Pivotal Trials:**

**Scleral Buckle vs. Vitrectomy:**
- Similar anatomic success for uncomplicated RRD
- Scleral buckle: Better for phakic, younger patients
- PPV: Preferred for pseudophakic, complex RDs
- Combined procedures for complex cases

**Pneumatic Retinopexy:**
- PIVOT trial: Lower success than PPV or buckle
- Appropriate for selected cases
- Cost-effective when successful
- Requires patient compliance

**Gas vs. Oil Tamponade:**
- Gas: Preferred for most cases
- Oil: PVR, inferior breaks, trauma, air travel
- Silicone oil removal needed
- Heavy oils (Densiron) for inferior breaks

**Surgical Decision Evidence:**

| Factor | Favor Buckle | Favor PPV |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Phakic | Yes | No (causes cataract) |
| Pseudophakic | Maybe | Yes |
| Single superior break | Either | Either |
| Multiple breaks | Maybe | Yes |
| Posterior breaks | No | Yes |
| Inferior breaks | Yes | Oil |
| PVR | No | Yes |
| Media opacity | No | Yes (clears media) |
| Giant tear | No | Yes |

## Advanced Surgical Techniques

**Small-Gauge Vitrectomy:**
- 23G, 25G, 27G systems
- Sutureless or sutured
- Faster recovery
- Less inflammation
- Comparable outcomes to 20G

**Perfluorocarbon Liquids:**
- "Heavy liquid" (heavier than water)
- Flattens retina during surgery
- Subretinal fluid displacement
- Makes posterior breaks accessible
- Removed at end of case

**Chandelier Lighting:**
- Bimanual surgery
- Illuminated chandelier
- Better visualization
- Allows bimanual dissection

**Wide-Angle Viewing Systems:**
- Resight, contact lenses
- Better peripheral view
- Easier break localization
- Improved surgical efficiency

**Endoscopic Vitrectomy:**
- Direct visualization
- When anterior segment cloudy
- Trauma cases
- Difficult anterior breaks

**Retinectomy:**
- Intentional retinal cutting
- For PVR, foreshortened retina
- Relaxes retina
- Last resort
- Sacrifices peripheral vision

## Complex Detachments

**PVR Management:**
- Grade C requires aggressive surgery
- Membrane peeling (delamination)
- Retinectomy for shortening
- Long-acting tamponade (silicone oil)
- May need repeat procedures
- Adjunctive agents (5-FU, daunorubicin) studied

**Giant Retinal Tear:**
- >90 degrees extent
- High PVR risk
- Posterior flap may fold
- Perfluorocarbon liquid essential
- PPV with buckle
- Laser posterior to break
- Long-acting gas or oil

**Coloboma RD:**
- Associated with uveal coloboma
- Breaks at coloboma margin
- No retina in coloboma
- Laser demarcation possible
- Scleral buckle challenging
- PPV with oil tamponade

**Myopic Tractional Maculopathy:**
- Staphyloma-associated
- Foveoschisis + detachment
- Macular hole may be present
- PPV with ILM peel
- Gas tamponade
- Positioning important

**Choroidal Detachment with RD:**
- Suprachoroidal fluid compresses retina
- Drain choroidals first
- Small gauge vitrectomy
- May need external drainage
- Perfluorocarbon helpful

## Emerging Technologies

**Robotic Surgery:**
- Preceyes system
- Steady instrument manipulation
- Not yet FDA approved
- Future potential

**Augmented Reality:**
- Heads-up displays
- Surgical navigation
- 3D visualization
- Already available

**Artificial Intelligence:**
- Ultrasound interpretation
- Break detection
- Prognosis prediction
- Surgical planning assistance

**New Agents:**
- Ocriplasmin (Jetrea): for vitreomacular traction
- Adjuncts for PVR prevention
- Pharmacologic vitreolysis
- Anti-PVR agents (research)

## Controversies

**Prophylactic Treatment for Lattice:**
- Most don't treat asymptomatic lattice
- Consider if:
  - Strong family history
  - Fellow eye RD
  - High myopia
  - High-risk occupation
- Laser or cryotherapy

**Bilateral Buckling:**
- Some advocate prophylactic buckle in fellow eye
- After unilateral RD with high-risk features
- Not standard of care
- Patient preference matters

**Silicone Oil Removal:**
- When: 3-12 months typical
- Earlier if complications
- Later if needed
- Some leave oil indefinitely
- Glaucoma risk with long-term

**Anti-VEGF Before Diabetic Vitrectomy:**
- Reduces bleeding, fibrovascular tissue
- May make dissection harder
- Timing: 3-7 days preoperative
- Used by many, not proven

**Primary Scleral Buckle vs. PPV:**
- Trend toward more PPV
- Scleral buckle still has role
- Phakic patients benefit from buckle
- Surgeon preference matters
- Cost considerations

**Macula Surgery:**
- ILM peel for macular hole RD
- Peeling technique varies
- ICG staining (toxicity concerns)
- Brilliant blue (safer)
- Trypan blue alternative`,

      clinicalNotes: `Advanced clinical pearls:

1. **Urgency matters** - Macula-on detachments are true emergencies. Prioritize these cases. Every hour counts for photoreceptor survival.

2. **Find all breaks** - Missed breaks are the most common cause of failure. Meticulous examination with indentation. Look for multiple breaks.

3. **Match surgery to pathology** - Don't use one approach for all RDs. Consider break characteristics, lens status, macular involvement, PVR.

4. **PVR is the challenge** - Proliferative vitreoretinopathy causes most recurrent RDs. Early surgery before PVR develops. Aggressive membrane peeling when present.

5. **Fellow eye surveillance** - After unilateral RD, fellow eye risk is 1-2% per year. Educate patient on warning signs. Consider prophylactic treatment selectively.

6. **Trauma needs special attention** - Breaks may be opposite injury site. Look for multiple breaks. May have delayed presentation. Consider choroidal rupture.

7. **Silicone oil is a tool, not default** - Use when needed (PVR, inferior breaks, trauma). Plan for removal. Discuss with patient.

8. **Positioning is critical** - Gas or oil tamponade requires proper positioning. Non-compliance causes failure. Set expectations preoperatively.`,
