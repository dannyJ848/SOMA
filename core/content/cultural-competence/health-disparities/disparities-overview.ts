Health disparities are preventable differences in health status and outcomes between groups.

**Definition:**

Health disparities refer to differences in health outcomes that are:
- Linked to social, economic, or environmental disadvantage
- Systemic and avoidable
- Unfair and unjust
- Potentially preventable with appropriate interventions

**Key Points:**

Not all health differences are disparities. Genetic variations, age-related changes, or personal choices are not inherently disparities. Disparities reflect systemic inequities.

**Disparities by Category:**

**Race/Ethnicity:**
- African Americans: Higher rates of hypertension, diabetes, maternal mortality
- Hispanic/Latinx: Higher rates of diabetes, obesity, cervical cancer
- Native Americans: Higher rates of diabetes, suicide, substance use disorders
- Asian Americans: Often overlooked due to "model minority" myth

**Socioeconomic Status:**
- Lower income: Higher rates of nearly all chronic diseases
- Lower education: Shorter life expectancy by up to 10-15 years
- Poverty: Associated with higher mortality across all causes

**Geography:**
- Rural areas: Healthcare provider shortages, hospital closures
- Urban areas: Environmental hazards, food deserts
- Regional variation: Life expectancy varies by up to 20 years by ZIP code

**Other Groups:**
- LGBTQ+ populations: Higher rates of depression, substance use, some cancers
- People with disabilities: Barriers to access, preventive care deficits
- Immigrants: Language barriers, fear of seeking care

**Why This Matters:**

Disparities result in:
- Millions of years of potential life lost annually
- Economic costs exceeding $300 billion yearly
- Unnecessary suffering and premature death
- Erosion of trust in healthcare system

Understanding disparities is essential for providing equitable care.

Health disparities affect nearly every area of health, but some show particularly stark differences.

**Chronic Disease Disparities:**

**Diabetes:**
- Hispanic adults are 70% more likely to have diabetes than non-Hispanic whites
- African Americans are 60% more likely to be diagnosed
- Complications (amputation, kidney failure) significantly higher

**Heart Disease:**
- African Americans have highest death rate from heart disease
- Hypertension prevalence: 56% of Black adults vs. 39% of white adults
- Earlier onset and worse outcomes in minority populations

**Respiratory Diseases:**
- Asthma: Puerto Rican Americans have highest rates
- COPD: Higher prevalence in lower SES and rural communities

- Native American women also face elevated risk
- Disparities persist across education and income levels

**Infant Mortality:**
- Black infant mortality rate is more than double white rate
- Native American infants also have elevated mortality
- Linked to access to prenatal care, social stressors

**Birth Outcomes:**
- Preterm birth and low birth weight disparities
- Contributing factors: chronic stress, discrimination, environmental exposures

**Mental Health and Substance Use:**

**Mental Health:**

- Access to mental health care varies dramatically
- Cultural factors in presentation and help-seeking

**Substance Use:**

Health disparities don't occur randomly—they result from systemic factors that accumulate over time.

**Historical Context:**

**Medical Exploitation:**
- Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972)
- Henrietta Lacks and HeLa cells
- Forced sterilizations
- Experimentation on marginalized groups

**Segregation and Exclusion:**
- Racially segregated hospitals until Civil Rights Act
- Exclusion from medical schools and professions
- "Sundown towns" and healthcare access
- Redlining and neighborhood disinvestment

**Legacy Effects:**
- Intergenerational trauma
- Distrust in medical system
- Wealth gaps affecting health resources
- Neighborhood segregation persisting today

**Structural Racism:**

Structural racism refers to the totality of ways society perpetuates racial inequity through interconnected systems.

**Healthcare System:**
- Implicit bias affecting diagnosis and treatment
- Limited diversity in healthcare workforce
- Language access barriers
- Insurance coverage gaps

**Criminal Justice:**
- Mass incarceration affecting community health
- Family separation and economic impact
- Healthcare access during and after incarceration

**Education:**
- Underfunded schools in minority communities
- Health education disparities
- Pipeline limitations for healthcare careers

**Housing:**
- Residential segregation
- Environmental hazards (pollution, lead exposure)
- Housing instability and homelessness

**Policy Factors:**

**Historical Policies:**
- Jim Crow laws and segregation
- Exclusion from New Deal benefits
- Urban renewal displacement
- GI Bill inequities

**Current Policies:**
- Medicaid expansion variations by state
- Immigration policies affecting access
- Food and nutrition policies
- Environmental regulation enforcement

**Economic Factors:**

**Income Inequality:**
- Wage gaps by race/ethnicity
- Intergenerational wealth effects
- Employment discrimination
- Underemployment and job quality

**Insurance Coverage:**
- Uninsured rates higher for minorities
- Underinsurance affecting care access
- Medicaid vs. private insurance networks
- Coverage gaps in non-expansion states

**Multi-Level Framework:**

Disparities operate at multiple levels:
1. **Individual**: Genetics, behaviors, stress
2. **Interpersonal**: Discrimination, social support
3. **Community**: Neighborhood conditions, social cohesion
4. **Institutional**: Healthcare, education, criminal justice systems
5. **Policy**: Laws, regulations, funding decisions

All levels interact to create and perpetuate disparities.

Addressing disparities requires multi-level solutions.

Measuring disparities is essential for identifying problems and tracking improvement.

**Data Collection Standards:**

**Federal Standards:**
- Race: American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Black/African American, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, White
- Ethnicity: Hispanic/Latino or Not Hispanic/Latino
- Language: Preferred language for healthcare
- Sex, gender identity, sexual orientation (increasingly collected)

**Best Practices:**
- Allow self-identification
- Collect detailed race/ethnicity data
- Include granular categories (e.g., Asian subgroups)
- Ask about preferred language, not just English proficiency
- Collect sexual orientation and gender identity data

**Why It Matters:**
- Identify disparities in care
- Quality improvement targeting
- Resource allocation
- Compliance with regulations

**Key Disparity Indicators:**

**Process Measures:**
- Preventive care utilization (vaccinations, screenings)
- Wait times for appointments
- Diagnostic testing rates
- Treatment guideline adherence

**Outcome Measures:**
- Disease control rates (HbA1c, blood pressure)
- Complication rates
- Readmission rates
- Mortality rates
- Patient-reported outcomes

**Experience Measures:**
- Patient satisfaction scores
- Communication quality ratings
- Trust and perceived discrimination
- Health literacy assessment

**Disparity Assessment Methods:**

**Stratification:**
- Break down quality measures by demographic groups
- Compare each group to the highest-performing group
- Identify gaps larger than a threshold (e.g., 10%)

**Statistical Approaches:**
- Chi-square tests for categorical data
- Regression models controlling for confounders
- Multilevel modeling for clustered data
- Trend analysis over time

**Rate Ratios:**
- Compare rates between groups
- Example: Group A rate / Group B rate
- Rate ratio >1 indicates disparity

**Absolute vs. Relative:**
- Absolute difference: Group A rate - Group B rate
- Relative difference: (Group A - Group B) / Group B
- Both provide different insights

**Local Disparity Analysis:**

**Steps for Practice-Level Analysis:**

1. **Collect Data**
   - Demographics of patient population
   - Key quality metrics
   - Patient experience data

2. **Identify Disparities**
   - Stratify outcomes by demographic groups
   - Look for patterns and gaps
   - Consider sample size issues

3. **Dig Deeper**
   - Explore root causes of identified disparities
   - Consider confounding factors
   - Examine contributing processes

4. **Take Action**
   - Target quality improvement efforts
   - Implement culturally appropriate interventions
   - Monitor progress over time

**Data Visualization:**
- Run charts showing trends by group
- Bar charts comparing group performance
- Heat maps showing geographic disparities
- Dashboard for ongoing monitoring

**Challenges in Measurement:**

- Small sample sizes for subgroups
- Inaccurate or incomplete demographic data
- Confounding by socioeconomic factors
- Causality vs. correlation

What gets measured gets addressed. Regular disparity assessment is essential for equity.
