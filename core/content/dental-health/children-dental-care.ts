      summary: 'Pediatric dental care integrates age-appropriate preventive strategies, behavioral management techniques, and early orthodontic intervention. Understanding dental development milestones and risk factors enables optimal care.',
      explanation: `## Dental Development Milestones

**Primary Dentition:**
- Total 20 teeth
- Eruption sequence: Central incisor → Lateral incisor → First molar → Canine → Second molar
- Root development continues 1-3 years after eruption
- Exfoliation: Roots resorb, tooth becomes mobile, falls out
- Exfoliation sequence: Anterior to posterior
- Girls usually slightly earlier than boys

**Mixed Dentition:**
- Age range: Approximately 6-12 years
- First permanent teeth: First molars (~6 years)
- Often mistaken for primary teeth
- Important to identify early

**Ugly Duckling Stage:**
- Maxillary central incisors (7-9 years)
- Midline diastema (spacing)
- Temporary
- Self-corrects with canine eruption
- Reassurance needed

**Eruption Sequences:**
- Maxillary: 6-1-2-3-4-5-7-8
- Mandibular: 6-1-2-3-4-5-7-8 (or 6-1-2-3-5-4-7-8)

## Caries Risk Assessment

**High Risk Indicators:**
- Previous caries experience
- Special health care needs
- Low socioeconomic status
- Frequent sugar intake
- Poor oral hygiene
- Xerostomia
- Deep pits/fissures
- Family history of caries

**Risk Assessment Tools:**
- CAMBRA (Caries Management by Risk Assessment)
- CAT (Caries Assessment Tool)
- AAPD Guidelines

**Preventive Protocols by Risk:**

| Risk | Fluoride Varnish | Sealants | Frequency |
|------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| Low | Every 6-12 months | Selective | 6 months |
| Moderate | Every 6 months | Indicated | 4-6 months |
| High | Every 3-6 months | All pits/fissures | 3-4 months |

## Behavioral Guidance

**Anticipatory Guidance:**
- Expectations by age
- Discuss upcoming developmental stages
- Prevention strategies
- Parent education

**Non-Nutritive Sucking Habits:**
- Duration: Normal <3 years
- Intensity: Less concern with pacifier vs. thumb
- Effects: Malocclusion, speech, skeletal
- Intervention: Positive reinforcement, appliances
- Referral: Orthodontist if habit persists after age 5

**Dental Anxiety:**
- Common, up to 20% of children
- Managed with: Tell-show-do, distraction, positive reinforcement
- Sedation: Nitrous oxide, oral sedation, general anesthesia
- Gradual desensitization for phobic children

## Trauma Management

**Primary Tooth Avulsion:**
- Do NOT replant
- Damage to developing tooth
- Space maintenance
- Monitor permanent tooth development

**Permanent Tooth Avulsion:**
- Replant immediately if possible
- Hold by crown, rinse if dirty
- Place back in socket (correct orientation)
- Seek immediate dental care
- Every minute counts

**Intrusion:**
- Primary: Re-eruption possible
- Permanent: May need repositioning or RCT

**Extrusion:**
- Reposition, stabilize
- Monitor pulp status
- May need root canal

**Subluxation:**
- Bleeding from gums
- Mobile tooth
- Soft diet, observation

**Crown Fracture:**
- Enamel only: Smooth edges
- Enamel-dentin: Bonding or crown
- Pulp exposure: Root canal treatment or extraction

## Restorative Considerations

**Primary Teeth:**
- Stainless steel crowns (SSC) for extensive decay
- Composite for smaller lesions
- Glass ionomer for interim restorations
- Pulpotomy: Vital pulp therapy
- Pulpectomy: Root canal therapy

**Stainless Steel Crowns:**
- Full coverage for primary molars
- Indications: Large lesions, hypomineralization
- Esthetic options available
- Very durable

**Pulp Therapy:**
- Indirect pulp cap: Deep caries, no symptoms
- Direct pulp cap: Small mechanical exposure
- Pulpotomy: Remove coronal pulp, preserve radicular
- Pulpectomy: Remove all pulp, fill root canals

## Orthodontic Considerations

**Early Treatment:**
- Space maintainers: Loss of primary tooth
- Regaining space: Regainers
- Habit appliances: Thumb sucking, tongue thrusting
- Expanders: Crossbite correction
- Functional appliances: Class II correction

**Timing:**
- First evaluation: Age 7
- Some conditions benefit from early treatment
- Comprehensive treatment: Most permanent teeth erupted
- Two-phase treatment possible for some cases

## Special Needs

**Children with Special Healthcare Needs (CSHCN):**
- Higher caries risk: Medications, diet, hygiene challenges
