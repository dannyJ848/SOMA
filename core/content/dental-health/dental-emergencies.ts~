      explanation: `## Classification of Dental Emergencies

**True Emergencies (Immediate Care Required):**
- Airway compromise
- Severe facial swelling
- Uncontrolled bleeding
- Avulsed tooth (time-critical)
- Facial fractures
- Severe infection with systemic signs

**Urgent (Same-Day Care):**
- Severe toothache
- Alveolar osteitis (dry socket)
- Abscess without airway compromise
- Luxation injuries
- Crown/root fracture with pain

**Semi-Urgent (Within 24-48 Hours):**
- Lost restoration (filling/crown)
- Chipped tooth without pain
- Broken denture
- Food impaction

## Traumatic Injuries

**Tooth Avulsion (Complete Displacement):**

*Management (Time Critical):*
1. Handle tooth by crown only (NOT root)
2. If clean: Reimplant immediately
3. If dirty: Rinse with saline/water, then reimplant
4. Gently close mouth to hold tooth
5. Seek immediate dental care

*Storage if Cannot Reimplant:*
- Best: Hank's Balanced Salt Solution
- Good: Milk, saliva (buccal sulcus)
- Acceptable: Saline
- Avoid: Water, dry storage, paper towel

*Prognosis:*
- Best if reimplanted within 5 minutes
- Good if <30 minutes
- Fair if 30-60 minutes
- Poor if >60 minutes (extraoral dry time)

**Luxation Injuries:**

*Concussion:*
- Tooth sensitive to percussion
- No mobility, no displacement
- Manage: Soft diet, observation

*Subluxation:*
- Mobility but no displacement
- Bleeding from gingival sulcus
- Manage: Stabilization, soft diet

*Lateral Luxation:*
- Tooth displaced in any direction
- May be locked into bone
- Manage: Reposition, stabilize

*Intrusion:*
- Tooth pushed into bone
- Worst prognosis
- May need orthodontic or surgical repositioning

*Extrusion:*
- Tooth partially out of socket
- Manage: Reposition, stabilize

**Fractures:**

*Enamel-Only:*
- No sensitivity
- Smooth sharp edges
- Manage: Smoothing or restoration

*Enamel-Dentin:*
- May be sensitive
- Risk of pulp exposure
- Manage: Bonding, crown, possibly root canal

*Enamel-Dentin-Pulp:*
- Pulp visible or exposed
- Very sensitive
- Manage: Root canal + restoration

*Root Fracture:*
- Confirmed by radiograph
- Prognosis depends on location
- Manage: Stabilization, possible extraction

**Alveolar Fracture:**
- Fracture of the bone socket
- Multiple teeth移动 together
- Manage: Reposition, splint, antibiotics

## Acute Dental Infections

**Acute Apical Abscess:**
- Pulp necrosis → bacterial spread
- Rapid onset, severe pain
- Swelling, possible fever
- Treatment: Drainage (root canal or extraction) + antibiotics

**Periodontal Abscess:**
- Acute infection in periodontal pocket
- Usually in patients with periodontitis
- Treatment: Debridement, irrigation, antibiotics

**Pericoronitis:**
- Infection around erupting tooth (usually wisdom tooth)
- Pain, swelling, limited opening
- Treatment: Irrigation, antibiotics, extraction

**Cellulitis:**
- Spreading infection through tissues
- No pus collection
- Diffuse swelling, redness
- Treatment: Antibiotics, treat source

**Ludwig's Angina:**
- Bilateral submandibular, submental, sublingual space infection
- Life-threatening airway compromise
- Treatment: Airway management, IV antibiotics, surgical drainage

## Acute Pain Conditions

**Irreversible Pulpitis:**
- Severe, spontaneous pain
- Lingering pain to temperature
- Night pain common
- Treatment: Root canal or extraction

**Acute Apical Periodontitis:**
- Pain to biting/percussion
- Tooth feels "high"
- Treatment: Root canal or extraction

**Reversible Pulpitis:**
- Pain to stimulus only
- Quick recovery after stimulus removed
- Treatment: Remove irritant (caries, high restoration)

**Dry Socket (Alveolar Osteitis):**
- After extraction (2-4 days)
- Severe pain, bad taste/odor
- Empty socket with exposed bone
- Risk factors: Smoking, difficult extraction, oral contraceptives
- Treatment: Irrigation, medicated dressing, analgesics

## Soft Tissue Injuries

**Lacerations:**
- Lips, tongue, cheeks
- Assess for foreign bodies
- Clean, irrigate
- Suture if needed
- Update tetanus if >5 years

**Mandibular Dislocation:**
- TMJ dislocates anteriorly
- Mouth locked open
- Treatment: Manual reduction
- Muscle relaxants, soft diet

## Immediate Management

**Pain Control:**
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen): First-line
- Acetaminophen: Alternative or adjunct
- Combination: More effective than opioids
- Opioids: Generally NOT indicated for dental pain

**Antibiotics:**
- Not first-line for most dental infections
- Indicated for: Cellulitis, systemic signs, compromised host
- Common choices: Amoxicillin, clindamycin (penicillin allergy)
- Duration: 5-7 days typically

**Cold Compress:**
- 15-20 minutes on, 20 minutes off
- Reduces swelling, provides some pain relief
- Use during first 24-48 hours

**Salt Water Rinses:**
- 1/2 teaspoon salt in warm water
- Cleansing, mild antibacterial
- Do not swallow`,

      summary: 'Dental emergencies encompass traumatic injuries, acute infections, and severe pain. Prompt assessment and management are essential to optimize outcomes, preserve teeth, and prevent life-threatening complications.',
      explanation: `## Emergency Assessment

**Primary Survey:**

## Trauma Management

**Dental Trauma Guidelines (IADT):**

*Avulsion Management (Permanent Tooth):*
1. Handle by crown, avoid root surface
2. Rinse if contaminated (<10 sec)
3. Reimplant immediately
4. Hold in place (gauze, foil, fingers)
5. Refer immediately to dentist

*Avulsion Management (Primary Tooth):*
- Do NOT reimplant
- May damage developing permanent tooth
- Space maintenance may be needed
- Reassure parents

*Luxation Injuries:*
- Local anesthesia as needed
- Reposition to normal position
- Stabilize with flexible splint
- Monitor vitality, mobility
- Splint duration: 7-14 days typically
- Root canal if pulp necrosis develops

*Fracture Management:*
- Ellis Class I: Enamel only - smooth edges
- Ellis Class II: Enamel/dentin - protect pulp, restore
- Ellis Class III: Enamel/dentin/pulp - root canal treatment

**Replantation Prognosis Factors:**
- Extraoral dry time (most critical)
- Storage medium
- Patient age (open apex = better)
- Timing of splint removal
- Endodontic treatment timing

## Infection Management

**Anatomic Spaces:**

*Maxillary:*
- Canine space
- Buccal space
- Infratemporal space
- Pterygomandibular space

*Mandibular:*
- Submental
- Submandibular
- Sublingual
- Masseteric
- Pterygomandibular

*Spread Patterns:*
- Maxillary infections: Periorbital, cavernous sinus
- Mandibular infections: Ludwig's angina, mediastinum

**Antibiotic Selection:**

*First-line:*
- Amoxicillin 500mg q8h
- For penicillin allergy: Clindamycin 300mg q6h
- Add metronidazole for anaerobes

*Severe infections:*
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate
- Clindamycin + optional addition based on culture
- Consider IV antibiotics for hospitalized patients

**Indications for Antibiotics:**
- Systemic signs of infection (fever, malaise)
- Lymphadenopathy
- Cellulitis
- Trismus (<20mm)
- Compromised host (diabetes, immunocompromised)
- Inability to achieve adequate drainage

**Antibiotics NOT Indicated:**

## Pain Management

**Acute Dental Pain:**

*NSAIDs (First-line):*
- Ibuprofen 400-600mg q6h
- Naproxen 500mg q12h
- Mechanism: COX inhibition reduces prostaglandin-mediated inflammation
- Effective for most dental pain

*Combination Therapy:*
- Ibuprofen + acetaminophen
- More effective than either alone
- Additive effect
- Avoid exceeding daily maximums

*Opioids:*
- Generally NOT recommended for acute dental pain
- Less effective than NSAIDs
- Side effects, dependence risk
- Consider only if NSAIDs contraindicated and severe pain

*Local Anesthesia:*
- Lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:100,000
