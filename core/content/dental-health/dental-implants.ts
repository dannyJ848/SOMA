      explanation: `**What is a Dental Implant?**

A dental implant is a small titanium post that acts as an artificial tooth root. It's placed into the jawbone and allowed to heal before a crown, bridge, or denture is attached to it.

**Parts of a Dental Implant:**

**1. The Implant (Fixture)**
- Titanium post placed in bone
- Acts as the tooth root
- Fuses with the jawbone

**2. The Abutment**
- Connector piece
- Attached to the implant
- Holds the replacement tooth

**3. The Restoration**
- Crown, bridge, or denture
- The visible part you see
- Looks like natural teeth

**Who Needs Dental Implants?**

- People missing one or more teeth
- People who cannot wear dentures
- People who don\'t want bridges
- People with sufficient jawbone

**Why Choose Implants?**

**Advantages:**
- Look and feel like natural teeth
- Don't affect neighboring teeth
- Very durable (can last a lifetime)
- Prevent bone loss
- Maintain facial structure
- Allow normal eating and speaking

**Disadvantages:**
- More expensive than other options
- Procedure takes several months
- Surgery required
- Not everyone is a candidate

**The Process:**

**Step 1: Evaluation**
- Examination and X-rays
- Bone quality assessment
- Treatment planning

**Step 2: Placement**
- Minor surgery
- Implant placed in jawbone
- Stitches placed

**Step 3: Healing (Osseointegration)**
- Implant fuses with bone
- Takes 3-6 months
- Important for success

**Step 4: Abutment Placement**
- Small connector attached
- Gum heals around it

**Step 5: Restoration**
- Crown, bridge, or denture attached
- Looks like natural tooth

**Caring for Implants:**
- Brush and floss just like natural teeth
- Regular dental checkups
- Avoid smoking
- Protect from grinding

**Success Rate:**
- Over 95% success rate
- Can last 20+ years with proper care`,
