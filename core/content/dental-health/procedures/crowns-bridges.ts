      summary: 'A crown is a cap that covers a damaged tooth to make it stronger and look better. A bridge replaces missing teeth by attaching artificial teeth to the natural teeth on each side.',
      explanation: `**What Is a Crown?**
A crown is like a helmet for your tooth - it covers and protects the whole visible part.

**When You Need a Crown:**
- Large filling with not much tooth left
- Cracked or broken tooth
- After root canal treatment
- To improve appearance

**What Is a Bridge?**
A bridge fills the gap from missing teeth using crowns on neighboring teeth connected to artificial teeth.

**The Process:**
1. Tooth is shaped (made smaller)
2. Impression or digital scan taken
3. Temporary crown/bridge placed
4. Permanent crown/bridge cemented

**How Long Do They Last?**
- Crowns: 10-15+ years
- Bridges: 10-15+ years
- With good care, can last much longer`,
