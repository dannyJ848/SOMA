      summary: 'Tooth whitening is a cosmetic procedure that lightens teeth and removes stains. Options include professional treatments at the dentist office and over-the-counter products for home use.',
      explanation: `**What is Tooth Whitening?**

Tooth whitening (also called bleaching) is a way to lighten the color of your teeth. It can remove stains and make your smile several shades brighter.

**Why Do Teeth Get Darker?**

- Food and drinks (coffee, tea, red wine)
- Tobacco use
- Aging (enamel thins, showing yellow dentin)
- Certain medications
- Poor dental hygiene
- Trauma to teeth

**Types of Whitening:**

**1. Professional In-Office Whitening**
- Done at the dentist office
- Takes about 1 hour
- Strongest whitening gel
- Special light may be used
- Immediate results (several shades lighter)
- Most expensive option

**2. Professional Take-Home Whitening**
- Custom-made trays from your dentist
- Whitening gel used at home
- Wear for 1-2 hours per day or overnight
- Results over 1-2 weeks
- Less expensive than in-office
- Good long-term results

**3. Over-the-Counter Products**
- Whitening strips, trays, rinses, toothpaste
- Weaker gel than professional options
- Takes longer to see results
- Least expensive option
- Results vary

**Does Whitening Work for Everyone?**

Whitening works best for:
- Yellow stains from aging, food, drinks
- Most external stains

Whitening does NOT work for:
- Internal stains from medications (like tetracycline)
- Very gray or brown stains
- Crowns, veneers, or fillings (these don't whiten)

**Side Effects:**

**Tooth Sensitivity:**
- Most common side effect
- Usually mild and temporary
- Goes away after treatment ends
- Can be managed with sensitivity toothpaste

**Gum Irritation:**
- From whitening gel touching gums
- Usually mild and temporary
- Goes away quickly

**How Long Do Results Last?**
- Usually 6 months to 2 years
- Depends on habits (coffee, smoking, etc.)
- Touch-up treatments can maintain results

**Who Should Avoid Whitening:**
- Pregnant or breastfeeding women
- Children under 16
- People with sensitive teeth
- People with many dental restorations
- People with gum disease

**Tips:**
- Start with a dental exam to check for cavities
- Use professional products for best results
- Avoid staining foods during treatment
- Follow directions carefully`,

      level: 2,
      summary: 'Tooth whitening uses peroxide-based bleaching agents to oxidize intrinsic and extrinsic chromogens. Professional treatments use higher concentrations (15-43% carbamide peroxide) than OTC products (3-10% carbamide peroxide).',
      explanation: `## Mechanism of Action

**Chromogens (Staining Molecules):**

*Extrinsic Stains:*
- Located on enamel surface
- From food, drinks, tobacco
- Coffee, tea, red wine, berries
- Respond well to whitening

*Intrinsic Stains:*
- Within enamel/dentin structure
- Aging, trauma, medications
- Fluorosis, tetracycline staining
- More challenging to treat

**Bleaching Chemistry:**

*Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂):*
- Active bleaching agent
- Decomposes to water and oxygen
- Oxidizes chromogen molecules
- Breaks double bonds in staining molecules
- Reflects more light (appears lighter)

*Carbamide Peroxide:*
- Breaks down to hydrogen peroxide + urea
- 10% carbamide peroxide ≈ 3.5% hydrogen peroxide
- More stable than hydrogen peroxide
- Longer shelf life
- Used in take-home products

## Treatment Options

      level: 3,
      summary: 'Tooth whitening utilizes oxidation-reduction reactions to break down chromophores. Optimal results depend on proper diagnosis, realistic expectations, and appropriate product selection based on stain type and patient factors.',
      explanation: `## Chemical Mechanisms

**Redox Reactions:**

*Oxidation of Chromophores:*
- H₂O₂ → H₂O + O (free radical)
- Oxygen radical attacks chromophore
- Breaks conjugated double bonds
- Larger molecules broken into smaller
- Reduced light absorption
- Appears lighter

*Types of Chromophores:*
- Extrinsic: Adherent pellicle staining
- Intrinsic: Enamel/dentin incorporated
- Age-related: Enamel thinning, secondary dentin
- Traumatic: Pulp hemorrhage products
- Developmental: Fluorosis, tetracycline incorporation

**Concentration and Time:**

*Relationship:*
- Higher concentration: More rapid effect
- Longer time: Cumulative effect
- Trade-off: Sensitivity increases
- Optimal: Balance results vs. side effects

*Comparative Concentrations:*
- OTC strips: 6-10% HP
- Custom tray: 10-20% CP (3.5-7% HP)
- In-office: 25-40% HP
- HP = Hydrogen peroxide, CP = Carbamide peroxide

## Treatment Planning

**Pretreatment Assessment:**

*Clinical Examination:*
- Caries screening
- Periodontal health
- Existing restorations
- Shade documentation
- Photographs
- Identify stain type

*Shade Assessment:*
- Vita Classical or 3D-Master shade guide
- Baseline documentation
- Expected improvement: 2-8 shades
- Realistic expectations

*Diagnosis of Stain Type:*
- Extrinsic: Good response
- Intrinsic yellow: Good response
- Intrinsic brown: Moderate response
- Intrinsic gray: Poor response
- Tetracycline: Very poor response

**Contraindications Revisited:**

*Absolute:*
- Peroxide allergy
- Active periodontal disease
