      "explanation": "Think of your skin like a three-layer sandwich. The top layer (epidermis) is what you see and touch - it's thin but tough, like plastic wrap. The middle layer (dermis) is thicker and contains all the important parts like blood vessels, hair roots, and nerves that let you feel things. The bottom layer (hypodermis) is made of fat that keeps you warm and cushions your body.\n\nYour skin does many amazing things:\n- Keeps germs and dirt out of your body\n- Holds water inside so you don't dry out\n- Helps control your body temperature\n- Lets you feel touch, pain, heat, and cold\n- Makes vitamin D when you're in sunlight\n\nYour skin is always renewing itself. Dead skin cells fall off the top layer every day (you shed millions of them!), and new cells grow from below to replace them. This cycle takes about a month.",

      "explanation": "**The Epidermis (Outer Layer)**\nThe epidermis is your skin's first line of defense. It's made mostly of cells called keratinocytes that produce a tough protein called keratin (the same protein in your hair and nails). This layer also contains:\n- Melanocytes: cells that make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color and protects against UV rays\n- Langerhans cells: immune cells that help fight infections\n- The epidermis has no blood vessels; it gets nutrients from the layer below\n\n**The Dermis (Middle Layer)**\nThis thicker layer contains:\n- Blood vessels that nourish the skin and help regulate temperature\n- Nerve endings for touch, pain, and temperature sensation\n- Hair follicles where hair grows\n- Sweat glands that help cool your body\n- Sebaceous (oil) glands that keep skin moisturized\n- Collagen and elastin fibers that give skin strength and elasticity\n\n**The Hypodermis (Subcutaneous Layer)**\nAlso called the subcutaneous tissue, this layer:\n- Stores fat for energy and insulation\n- Cushions and protects muscles and bones\n- Contains larger blood vessels and nerves\n- Helps attach skin to underlying tissues\n\n**Skin Thickness Varies**\nSkin is thickest on your palms and soles (about 4mm) and thinnest on your eyelids (about 0.5mm).",
