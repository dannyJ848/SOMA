      "explanation": "Your skin is like a superhero with many powers:\n\n**Protection** - Your skin is like armor that keeps out germs, dirt, and harmful things. It also keeps water inside your body so you don't dry out like a raisin!\n\n**Temperature Control** - When you're hot, your skin sweats to cool you down. When you're cold, it gets goosebumps and reduces blood flow to keep heat inside.\n\n**Feeling Things** - Your skin has millions of tiny sensors that let you feel touch, pressure, pain, heat, and cold. That's how you know when something is too hot or sharp.\n\n**Making Vitamin D** - When sunlight touches your skin, it helps make vitamin D, which keeps your bones strong.\n\n**Showing How You Feel** - Your skin can show emotions - you blush when embarrassed and turn pale when scared!\n\n**Healing Itself** - When you get a cut or scrape, your skin knows how to repair itself. Amazing!",

      "summary": "The skin performs six major functions: protection, sensation, thermoregulation, vitamin D synthesis, excretion, and immune defense.",
      "explanation": "**1. Protection (Barrier Function)**\n- Physical barrier: Prevents mechanical injury and invasion by microorganisms\n- Chemical barrier: Skin's acid mantle (pH 4.5-5.5) inhibits bacterial growth\n- Water barrier: The stratum corneum prevents excessive water loss (transepidermal water loss)\n- UV protection: Melanin absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation\n\n**2. Sensation**\nThe skin contains different types of nerve endings:\n- Touch receptors (Meissner corpuscles) - detect light touch\n- Pressure receptors (Pacinian corpuscles) - detect deep pressure and vibration\n- Pain receptors (nociceptors) - detect harmful stimuli\n- Temperature receptors - detect hot and cold\n- Itch receptors - specialized nerve fibers\n\n**3. Thermoregulation**\n- Vasodilation: Blood vessels widen to release heat when hot\n- Vasoconstriction: Blood vessels narrow to conserve heat when cold\n- Sweating: Evaporation of sweat cools the body (up to 10 liters/day possible)\n- Shivering reflex triggered by skin temperature sensors\n\n**4. Vitamin D Synthesis**\nUVB radiation converts 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), which is then processed by the liver and kidneys to its active form.\n\n**5. Excretion**\nSweat glands eliminate:\n- Water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride)\n- Small amounts of urea and ammonia\n- Trace minerals\n\n**6. Immune Defense**\n- Langerhans cells patrol for invaders\n- Antimicrobial peptides kill bacteria directly\n- Healthy skin microbiome outcompetes pathogens",
