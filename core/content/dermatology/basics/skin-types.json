Lucky you!\n- **Dry skin** - Feels tight, may be flaky or rough\n- **Oily skin** - Looks shiny, especially on the forehead, nose, and chin\n- **Combination skin** - Oily in some areas (usually the T-zone), dry in others\n- **Sensitive skin** - Gets red, itchy, or irritated easily\n\n**By How Your Skin Reacts to the Sun:**\nDermatologists use a scale from 1 to 6:\n- Types 1-2: Very fair skin that burns easily and rarely tans\n- Types 3-4: Medium skin that sometimes burns and tans\n- Types 5-6: Dark skin that rarely burns and tans easily\n\nKnowing your skin type helps you:\n- Choose the right skincare products\n- Know how much sun protection you need\n- Understand what skin problems you might be more likely to get",
