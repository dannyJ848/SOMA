# Severe Allergic Reaction (Anaphylaxis)

## Overview
Anaphylaxis is a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds to minutes of exposure to an allergen. It affects multiple body systems simultaneously and can progress to shock and death without immediate treatment. Epinephrine (adrenaline) is the first-line treatment and must be given as quickly as possible. This is always a 911 emergency.

## Recognizing Anaphylaxis

### Level 1: Foundation
**Warning signs of anaphylaxis:**

**Skin reactions:**
- Hives (raised, itchy welts)
- Flushing or redness
- Swelling, especially face, lips, tongue, throat

**Breathing problems:**
- Difficulty breathing or wheezing
- Throat tightness or closing
- Hoarse voice or difficulty speaking
- Coughing

**Cardiovascular:**
- Rapid or weak pulse
- Dizziness or fainting
- Pale or blue skin color

**Other symptoms:**
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Abdominal cramps
- Feeling of doom or anxiety

**Key point**: Anaphylaxis can occur WITHOUT skin symptoms in 10-20% of cases.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**How anaphylaxis develops:**

Anaphylaxis typically progresses rapidly:
- **Within minutes**: Skin reactions, itching, warmth
- **Minutes to hours**: Breathing difficulty, cardiovascular symptoms
- **Without treatment**: Progression to shock, loss of consciousness, death

**Two or more body systems affected:**
For anaphylaxis diagnosis, typically requires sudden onset with involvement of two or more:
1. Skin/mucosal (hives, swelling, itching)
2. Respiratory (wheezing, stridor, shortness of breath)
3. Cardiovascular (low blood pressure, fainting)
4. Gastrointestinal (vomiting, cramping, diarrhea)

**Common triggers:**
- Foods: Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, milk, eggs, wheat, soy
- Insect stings: Bees, wasps, hornets, fire ants
- Medications: Antibiotics (penicillin), NSAIDs, anesthetics
- Latex
- Exercise (exercise-induced anaphylaxis)
- Unknown/idiopathic (no trigger identified)

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Severity assessment:**

| Severity | Symptoms | Urgency |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Mild allergic reaction | Localized hives, itching, mild swelling | Monitor closely, antihistamines |
| Moderate | Widespread hives, facial swelling, nausea | Give epinephrine, call 911 |
| Severe (anaphylaxis) | Breathing difficulty, throat tightness, cardiovascular symptoms | Epinephrine STAT, 911 |
| Life-threatening | Severe breathing obstruction, shock, unconsciousness | Multiple interventions needed |

**When to use epinephrine:**
Use auto-injector immediately if:
- Known severe allergy with ANY symptoms after exposure
- Breathing difficulty or throat tightness
- Swelling of lips, tongue, or throat
- Feeling faint or actual fainting
- Hives PLUS breathing or cardiovascular symptoms
- Severe abdominal symptoms after allergen exposure

**When in doubt, USE IT** - The risks of not treating anaphylaxis far exceed risks of epinephrine.

**Epinephrine timing:**
- Prompt administration reduces hospitalization
- Delayed use increases risk of death
- Can repeat in 5-15 minutes if no improvement
- Most deaths occur from delayed or no epinephrine use

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Biphasic anaphylaxis:**
- Second reaction 1-72 hours after initial reaction
- Occurs in up to 20% of anaphylaxis cases
- Can occur even after initial symptoms resolve
- Why observation period (4-6 hours minimum) is required
- Why carrying two auto-injectors is recommended

**Anaphylaxis pathophysiology:**
- IgE-mediated (classic allergic): Prior sensitization required
- Non-IgE mediated: Can occur on first exposure
- Mast cell and basophil degranulation
- Massive histamine and mediator release
- Vasodilation, increased permeability, smooth muscle contraction

**High-risk features:**
- History of severe reactions
- Asthma (especially poorly controlled)
- Cardiovascular disease
- Taking beta-blockers (may not respond to epinephrine as well)
- Mastocytosis
- Adolescents and young adults (risk-taking behavior)

**Differential diagnosis:**
- Vasovagal reaction (fainting) - No hives, no respiratory symptoms
- Panic attack - No objective findings
- Asthma attack - No systemic symptoms
- Hereditary angioedema - No hives, no hypotension
- Scombroid poisoning - Fish histamine, resolves quickly

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Refractory anaphylaxis:**
When first-line treatment fails:
- May need IV epinephrine infusion
- Glucagon for patients on beta-blockers
- Vasopressors for persistent hypotension
- Intubation for airway protection
- Fluid resuscitation (up to 4-6 liters may be needed)

**Special populations:**

**Pregnant women:**
- Epinephrine is still first-line treatment
- Fetal distress occurs with maternal hypoxia/hypotension
- Left lateral position to avoid vena cava compression
- Fetal monitoring needed

**Infants and children:**
- Symptoms may be difficult to describe
- Sudden behavioral changes
- Feeding difficulties
- Lethargy or floppiness
- Weight-based epinephrine dosing

**Elderly:**
- May have blunted symptoms
- Higher risk of cardiovascular complications
- Drug interactions more common
- Lower threshold for ICU monitoring

**Exercise-induced anaphylaxis:**
- Occurs during or after exercise
- Often food-dependent (specific food + exercise triggers)
- May be prevented by avoiding trigger foods before exercise
- Carry epinephrine during all exercise

**Long-term management:**
- Allergist evaluation essential
- Component testing to identify specific triggers
- Oral immunotherapy (for some food allergies)
- Venom immunotherapy (for insect allergies)
- Anaphylaxis action plan development

## What to Do

### Level 1: Foundation
**Immediate actions:**
1. **Recognize anaphylaxis** - Multiple symptoms, rapid onset
2. **Use epinephrine auto-injector immediately** (if available)
3. **Call 911** - Say "anaphylaxis" or "severe allergic reaction"
4. **Lie flat** (unless vomiting or having trouble breathing)
5. **Call for help** - Don't leave person alone

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Using an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen/Auvi-Q):**

**EpiPen:**
1. Remove blue safety cap
2. Hold orange tip against outer thigh (through clothing is OK)
3. Press firmly until click
4. Hold in place for 10 seconds
5. Remove and massage area for 10 seconds
6. Note the time

**Auvi-Q:**
1. Pull off red safety guard
2. Place black end against outer thigh
3. Press firmly and hold for 5 seconds
4. Device provides voice instructions

**Important points:**
- Outer thigh is preferred site
- Can inject through clothing
- Never inject into buttocks or vein
- Single-use only
- Bring used device to ER

**After epinephrine:**
- Call 911 if not already done
- Second dose can be given in 5-15 minutes if no improvement
- Lie flat with legs elevated (unless breathing problems)
- If vomiting: Recovery position on side
- If pregnant: Lie on left side

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**What to tell 911:**
- "This is anaphylaxis" or "severe allergic reaction"
- What caused the reaction (if known)
- Whether epinephrine was given and when
- Person's age and approximate weight
- Symptoms currently present
- Known allergies and medical conditions
- Location

**While waiting for EMS:**
- Stay with the person
- Monitor breathing constantly
- Be prepared to give second epinephrine dose
- If person becomes unresponsive and stops breathing: CPR
- Look for medical ID jewelry
- Gather auto-injector to bring to hospital (shows what was given)

**If no epinephrine available:**
- Call 911 immediately
- Have person lie flat
- Raise legs if possible
- Loosen tight clothing
- If person has antihistamines, can give (but won't stop anaphylaxis)
- Be prepared to do CPR

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Hospital treatment:**
- IV epinephrine if needed
- IV fluids for blood pressure support
- Corticosteroids (reduce risk of biphasic reaction)
- Antihistamines (for symptom relief)
- Bronchodilators (for wheezing)
- Oxygen
- Monitoring for 4-6+ hours

**Observation requirements:**
- Minimum 4 hours after symptom resolution
- Longer (8-24 hours) for:
  - Severe initial reaction
  - Required multiple epinephrine doses
  - History of biphasic reactions
  - Poor access to emergency care

**Discharge planning:**
- Prescription for epinephrine auto-injectors (2)
- Written anaphylaxis action plan
- Allergy referral
- Medical alert identification
- Education on trigger avoidance

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Prevention strategies:**

**For known allergies:**
- Strict allergen avoidance
- Read all food labels carefully
- Ask about ingredients at restaurants
- Inform schools, workplaces, caregivers
- Wear medical alert identification
- Always carry two epinephrine auto-injectors
- Check expiration dates regularly
- Store properly (room temperature, protect from light)

**Anaphylaxis action plan components:**
- Trigger identification
- Symptoms to recognize
- Step-by-step treatment instructions
- Emergency contact numbers
- Medication locations
- When to use epinephrine vs. antihistamines

**Immunotherapy options:**
- Venom immunotherapy: 95% effective for insect allergies
- Oral immunotherapy: Emerging for food allergies
- Reduces severity and risk of reactions
- Does not eliminate need for emergency preparedness

**Common mistakes that lead to death:**
- Not carrying epinephrine
- Delayed epinephrine use
- Not calling 911
- Using antihistamines instead of epinephrine
- Not staying for observation
- Not having a second auto-injector available

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **When in doubt, give epinephrine** - Underuse kills, not overuse
2. **Always call 911** - Even if symptoms improve with epinephrine
3. **Carry two auto-injectors** - Biphasic reactions require second dose
4. **Antihistamines don't treat anaphylaxis** - They only help mild symptoms
5. **Observation is mandatory** - Late reactions can be severe

## Summary

Anaphylaxis is a severe, rapidly progressing allergic reaction that can be fatal within minutes. Recognition requires identifying symptoms in multiple body systems: skin (hives, swelling), respiratory (wheezing, throat tightness), cardiovascular (low blood pressure, fainting), and gastrointestinal (vomiting, cramps). Epinephrine is the ONLY life-saving treatment and must be given immediately - do not wait for symptoms to worsen. Always call 911 even if epinephrine helps, as biphasic reactions can occur hours later. Prevention requires strict allergen avoidance, always carrying two auto-injectors, and having a written action plan.
