# Severe Breathing Difficulty

## Overview
Severe breathing difficulty (respiratory distress) is a medical emergency that can rapidly become life-threatening. When a person cannot get adequate oxygen, every organ in the body suffers, and death can occur within minutes. Causes range from asthma attacks to heart failure to airway obstruction. Quick recognition and response - including calling 911, positioning, and using prescribed medications - can save lives.

## Recognizing Severe Breathing Difficulty

### Level 1: Foundation
**Warning signs of breathing emergency:**

**Severe respiratory distress:**
- Cannot speak in full sentences (only a few words at a time)
- Struggling to breathe - using extra muscles
- Making unusual sounds (wheezing, stridor, gurgling)
- Blue or gray color to lips, face, or fingernails
- Sitting bolt upright or leaning forward to breathe
- Extreme anxiety or panic about breathing
- Drowsy or confused (ominous sign - means oxygen is very low)

**Key point**: If someone cannot complete a sentence without stopping to breathe, this is an emergency.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Signs of respiratory distress by severity:**

| Severity | Signs | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Mild | Slightly short of breath, can talk normally | Monitor, rest |
| Moderate | Speaks in short sentences, visible effort | Help with medications, consider 911 |
| Severe | Few words at a time, very distressed | Call 911 immediately |
| Critical | Cannot speak, blue, confused/drowsy | 911 STAT, prepare for CPR |

**What to look for:**

**Increased work of breathing:**
- Nasal flaring (nostrils widening)
- Neck muscles straining
- Ribs showing with each breath
- Abdomen moving in when chest moves out (paradoxical)
- Sitting in tripod position (leaning forward on hands)

**Abnormal sounds:**
- Wheezing: Whistling (narrowed airways - asthma, allergic reaction)
- Stridor: High-pitched, harsh (upper airway obstruction)
- Gurgling: Fluid in airway
- Crackles: Bubbling sound (fluid in lungs)
- Silence: May mean air is not moving (very dangerous)

**Color changes:**
- Blue lips (cyanosis) - Oxygen very low
- Gray or ashen skin
- Pale, sweaty face

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Common causes of breathing emergencies:**

**Lung problems:**
- Asthma attack
- COPD exacerbation
- Pneumonia
- Pulmonary embolism (blood clot)
- Pneumothorax (collapsed lung)

**Airway problems:**
- Choking/foreign body
- Allergic reaction/anaphylaxis
- Swelling (infection, burns)
- Croup (in children)

**Heart problems:**
- Heart failure (fluid backs up into lungs)
- Heart attack
- Arrhythmia

**Other causes:**
- Anxiety/panic attack
- Overdose
- Carbon monoxide poisoning
- Trauma to chest

**Differentiating causes:**

| Cause | Key Clues |
|-------|-----------|
| Asthma | History of asthma, wheezing, often has trigger |
| Heart failure | Worse lying down, leg swelling, frothy sputum |
| Allergic reaction | Exposure to allergen, hives, swelling |
| Pneumonia | Fever, productive cough, gradual onset |
| Pulmonary embolism | Sudden onset, leg pain/swelling, recent surgery/travel |
| Anxiety | No physical signs, hyperventilating, fear |
| Choking | Sudden onset while eating, cannot speak |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Respiratory failure stages:**

**Stage 1 - Distress:**
- Body compensating
- Rapid breathing
- Elevated heart rate
- Anxious, aware

**Stage 2 - Exhaustion:**
- Compensation failing
- Breathing rate may slow
- Confusion developing
- Color changes

**Stage 3 - Failure:**
- Inadequate oxygen/too much CO2
- Altered consciousness
- Respiratory arrest imminent
- Needs immediate intervention

**Ominous signs (impending respiratory arrest):**
- Decreasing respiratory rate (tiring out)
- Altered mental status (confusion, drowsiness)
- Silent chest (no air movement despite effort)
- Bradycardia (slow heart rate)
- Complete exhaustion
- Loss of consciousness

**Oxygen saturation interpretation:**
- 95-100%: Normal
- 90-94%: Mild hypoxemia
- 85-89%: Moderate hypoxemia
- <85%: Severe hypoxemia - emergency

Note: Pulse oximeters are less accurate in:
- Carbon monoxide poisoning (reads falsely high)
- Poor circulation
- Dark nail polish
- Severe anemia

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Specific emergency conditions:**

**Acute severe asthma (status asthmaticus):**
- Not responding to usual rescue inhaler
- Cannot speak, extreme distress
- Silent chest possible (no air movement)
- Needs IV steroids, nebulized medications
- May need mechanical ventilation

**Acute heart failure ("flash pulmonary edema"):**
- Sudden severe shortness of breath
- Frothy, pink-tinged sputum
- Orthopnea (can't lie flat)
- Often triggered by: missed medications, salt intake, fluid intake
- Position upright, legs down to reduce heart workload

**Tension pneumothorax:**
- Sudden severe dyspnea
- Trauma or spontaneous
- Trachea deviated away from affected side
- Absent breath sounds on one side
- Life-threatening - needs immediate needle decompression

**Pulmonary embolism:**
- Sudden shortness of breath
- Chest pain (often pleuritic - worse with breathing)
- Risk factors: Recent surgery, travel, immobility, cancer
- May be catastrophic if massive

**Anaphylaxis with airway compromise:**
- Swelling of lips, tongue, throat
- Stridor (upper airway narrowing)
- Needs epinephrine immediately
- Airway may close completely

**Epiglottitis (more common in children but occurs in adults):**
- Sore throat, difficulty swallowing
- Drooling
- Muffled voice
- Sitting forward, chin out
- Do NOT examine throat (can cause complete obstruction)

## What to Do

### Level 1: Foundation
**Immediate actions:**
1. **Call 911** - Severe breathing problems need emergency help
2. **Help person sit up** - Usually easier to breathe upright
3. **Stay calm** - Panic worsens breathing difficulty
4. **Open windows** - Fresh air helps
5. **Help with prescribed medications** - Inhalers, epinephrine

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Positioning for breathing:**

**Best positions:**
- **Sitting upright**: Standard for most breathing problems
- **Tripod position**: Sitting, leaning forward on hands (opens airways)
- **High Fowler's**: Sitting at 90 degrees (heart failure)
- **Recovery position**: Only if unconscious but breathing

**Do NOT lay person flat** unless:
- They are unconscious and you need to do CPR
- They specifically say lying flat is more comfortable

**Helping with medications:**

**Rescue inhaler (albuterol, ProAir, Ventolin):**
- Help person use it
- Shake well, remove cap
- Have them breathe out first
- Press and inhale deeply
- Hold breath 10 seconds if possible
- Can repeat after 1 minute
- Call 911 if not improving after 3-4 puffs

**Epinephrine auto-injector (for anaphylaxis):**
- Use immediately if allergic reaction with breathing difficulty
- Inject into outer thigh
- Call 911 even if it helps

**Oxygen (if available and prescribed):**
- Turn on to prescribed setting
- Apply nasal cannula or mask
- Do not increase flow rate without guidance

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**What to tell 911:**
- "Severe breathing difficulty" or "can't breathe"
- What triggered it (if known)
- Person's age and medical conditions
- Medications available and given
- Current condition (talking? conscious? color?)
- Location

**While waiting for EMS:**
- Keep person calm and still
- Loosen tight clothing (collar, belt)
- Don't give food or drink
- Monitor breathing constantly
- Be prepared to do CPR if breathing stops
- Gather medications to bring to hospital
- Note time symptoms started and treatments given

**Specific conditions:**

**For asthma:**
- Help with rescue inhaler
- Keep person calm
- Position sitting upright
- Remove from triggers if possible
- Call 911 if inhaler not working

**For allergic reaction:**
- Use epinephrine immediately if available
- Call 911
- Position for comfort
- Monitor for worsening

**For heart failure:**
- Position sitting up with legs down
- Help with prescribed medications
- Call 911
- Be ready for cardiac arrest

**For panic attack (if certain not physical cause):**
- Calm, reassuring presence
- Slow, controlled breathing with person
- Remove from stressful situation
- If any doubt, treat as physical emergency

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Rescue breathing basics (if trained):**

If person stops breathing but has pulse:
- Give 1 breath every 5-6 seconds
- Each breath over 1 second
- Watch for chest rise
- Recheck pulse every 2 minutes

If no pulse:
- Begin full CPR
- 30 compressions to 2 breaths
- Continue until EMS arrives

**Bag-valve mask use (if available and trained):**
- Position mask for tight seal
- Open airway
- Squeeze bag to deliver breath
- Watch for chest rise
- One breath every 5-6 seconds for respiratory arrest

**Advanced airway considerations (EMS/hospital):**
- Endotracheal intubation
- Supraglottic airways
- Needle cricothyrotomy (for complete obstruction)
- Mechanical ventilation

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Special populations:**

**Children:**
- Higher respiratory rate normal
- Smaller airways - obstruct more easily
- Fatigue quickly
- May not complain even when severe
- Nasal flaring, grunting, retractions are key signs

**Elderly:**
- May not show typical signs
- Confusion may be first sign of hypoxia
- More likely cardiac cause
- Comorbidities complicate picture

**COPD patients:**
- Usually live with some breathlessness
- Emergency when significantly worse than baseline
- May have prescribed home oxygen
- May retain CO2 - high oxygen can be harmful
- Let EMS manage oxygen levels

**Pregnancy:**
- Normal to be slightly short of breath
- Emergency if severe or sudden
- Pulmonary embolism risk higher
- Position on left side if lying down
- Fetal distress occurs with maternal hypoxia

**Post-event care:**
Even if breathing improves:
- Medical evaluation needed
- Underlying cause must be identified
- Medication adjustments may be needed
- Action plan for future episodes
- Follow-up essential

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Can't complete a sentence = emergency** - Call 911 immediately
2. **Position upright** - Almost always helps breathing
3. **Drowsiness with breathing difficulty is ominous** - Oxygen is critically low
4. **Help with prescribed medications** - Inhalers, epinephrine
5. **Be ready for CPR** - Respiratory emergencies can lead to cardiac arrest

## Summary

Severe breathing difficulty is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate action. Key warning signs include inability to speak in sentences, visible struggling to breathe, blue color, and drowsiness or confusion. Call 911 immediately for any severe respiratory distress. Help the person sit upright (usually the best position for breathing), stay calm, loosen tight clothing, and help with prescribed medications like rescue inhalers or epinephrine. Common causes include asthma attacks, heart failure, allergic reactions, pneumonia, and airway obstruction. Monitor constantly and be prepared to perform CPR if breathing stops.
