# Choking

## Overview
Choking occurs when an object blocks the airway, preventing air from reaching the lungs. Complete airway obstruction is a life-threatening emergency - without intervention, brain damage begins within 4 minutes and death can occur within 6-10 minutes. The Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts) can dislodge the obstruction and save a life. Everyone should know how to respond to choking in adults, children, and infants.

## Recognizing Choking

### Level 1: Foundation
**Signs of choking:**

**Mild obstruction (can still cough/breathe):**
- Forceful coughing
- Wheezing between coughs
- Able to speak some words
- Red face

**Severe obstruction (cannot breathe effectively):**
- Cannot speak, cry, or make noise
- Silent cough or weak cough
- Cannot breathe or very weak breathing
- Clutching throat (universal choking sign)
- Turning blue (especially lips and fingernails)
- Loss of consciousness

**Key question to ask:** "Are you choking?" If they cannot speak or only nod, this is severe obstruction.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Mild vs. severe obstruction:**

| Feature | Mild Obstruction | Severe Obstruction |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Can speak | Yes | No |
| Can cough | Forcefully | Weak or silent |
| Can breathe | Yes, with some difficulty | No or very limited |
| Color | May be red | May be blue |
| Consciousness | Alert | May be decreasing |
| Action needed | Encourage coughing | Immediate intervention |

**Common choking hazards:**

**Adults:**
- Large pieces of meat (especially steak)
- Hot dogs
- Bread products
- Hard candy
- Grapes

**Children:**
- Hot dogs (leading cause)
- Hard candy, gum
- Grapes (whole)
- Nuts
- Popcorn
- Raw vegetables
- Chunks of meat or cheese
- Coins, buttons, small toys

**Risk factors for choking:**
- Eating too quickly
- Not chewing food thoroughly
- Laughing or talking while eating
- Alcohol intoxication (reduces gag reflex)
- Dental problems (poorly fitting dentures)
- Neurological conditions affecting swallowing
- Young children (narrow airways, explore with mouth)
- Elderly (weaker swallowing muscles)

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Assessment sequence:**

1. **Is the person conscious?**
   - If yes: Determine severity of obstruction
   - If no: Begin CPR

2. **Can they speak or cough effectively?**
   - If yes: This is mild obstruction - encourage coughing
   - If no: This is severe obstruction - act immediately

3. **What is their age/size?**
   - Adult/child over 1 year: Abdominal thrusts
   - Infant under 1 year: Back blows and chest thrusts

**Choking vs. other conditions:**

| Condition | Key Difference from Choking |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Asthma attack | Gradual onset, wheezing throughout, no foreign body |
| Allergic reaction | Other symptoms (hives, swelling), ate allergen |
| Heart attack | Chest pain, can usually still speak |
| Panic attack | Can still breathe and speak, no physical obstruction |
| Seizure | Unconscious, convulsing, no choking signs before |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Anatomy of airway obstruction:**

**Supraglottic (above vocal cords):**
- Object in mouth or pharynx
- May be visible
- Finger sweep may work (with caution)

**At glottic level (vocal cords):**
- Object lodged at larynx
- Most dangerous location
- Abdominal thrusts may dislodge

**Subglottic (below vocal cords):**
- Object in trachea
- Abdominal thrusts less effective
- May require surgical airway

**Why abdominal thrusts work:**
- Creates sudden increase in abdominal pressure
- Pushes diaphragm up
- Forces air from lungs
- Creates artificial cough
- Dislodges object from airway

**Complications of choking response:**
- Rib fractures (especially elderly)
- Abdominal organ injury
- Regurgitation and aspiration
- These are acceptable risks when choking is life-threatening

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Special populations:**

**Pregnant women (late pregnancy):**
- Use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts
- Position hands at base of breastbone
- Same technique as for very obese adults

**Obese adults:**
- If cannot reach around abdomen: Chest thrusts
- Position hands at base of breastbone
- Perform same motion as abdominal thrusts

**Wheelchair users:**
- May perform abdominal thrusts while seated
- Position yourself appropriately
- Same hand placement and technique

**People with tracheostomies:**
- Obstruction may be at stoma or below
- May need to address both natural airway and stoma
- Suction if available

**If you are alone and choking:**
- Call 911 if possible (even if cannot speak)
- Give yourself abdominal thrusts with your fist
- Or lean over firm object (chair back, counter edge)
- Apply pressure to upper abdomen
- Do not use a sharp edge

**When standard techniques fail:**
- In hospital: Laryngoscopy and removal with forceps
- Surgical airway (cricothyrotomy) as last resort
- Only by trained medical professionals

## What to Do

### Level 1: Foundation
**For conscious adult or child (over 1 year):**

**If mild obstruction (can cough/speak):**
1. Stay calm and stay with them
2. Encourage forceful coughing
3. Do not interfere if coughing is effective
4. Call 911 if obstruction does not clear

**If severe obstruction (cannot breathe/speak):**
1. Ask "Are you choking?" (they will nod)
2. Tell them you're going to help
3. Perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver)
4. Continue until object is expelled or person becomes unconscious

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) - ADULT/CHILD:**

1. Stand behind the person
2. Wrap arms around their waist
3. Make a fist with one hand
4. Place fist thumb-side against abdomen, above navel and below breastbone
5. Grasp fist with other hand
6. Give quick, upward thrusts
7. Repeat until object expelled or person becomes unconscious

**Key points:**
- Each thrust should be separate and distinct
- Direct thrust upward and inward
- Use enough force (don't be timid)
- Check after each thrust if object expelled

**If person becomes unconscious:**
1. Lower them gently to the ground
2. Call 911 (or have someone call)
3. Begin CPR (compressions may dislodge object)
4. Before each breath, open mouth and look for object
5. Only remove object if you can see it

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**For INFANTS (under 1 year):**

**Combination of back blows and chest thrusts:**

1. **Position infant:**
   - Place infant face-down on your forearm
   - Support head and neck
   - Rest forearm on your thigh
   - Keep infant's head lower than body

2. **Back blows (5):**
   - Use heel of hand
   - Deliver 5 firm blows between shoulder blades
   - Check if object expelled

3. **Flip infant:**
   - Support head
   - Turn face-up on forearm or thigh

4. **Chest thrusts (5):**
   - Place 2 fingers on breastbone, just below nipple line
   - Give 5 quick downward thrusts
   - About 1.5 inches deep

5. **Repeat:**
   - Continue alternating 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts
   - Until object expelled or infant becomes unresponsive

**If infant becomes unresponsive:**
- Begin infant CPR
- Look in mouth before each breath
- Only remove objects you can see

**NEVER do with infants:**
- Blind finger sweeps
- Abdominal thrusts (risk of organ damage)
- Hold upside down by feet

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Choking in specific situations:**

**At a restaurant:**
- Ask clearly: "Is anyone trained in first aid?"
- Have someone call 911
- Don't be afraid to act - Good Samaritan laws protect you
- After clearing obstruction, medical evaluation recommended

**Partial obstruction that doesn't clear:**
- Call 911 immediately
- Keep person calm (panic increases oxygen demand)
- Position for optimal airflow (often sitting upright)
- Be prepared to act if complete obstruction develops

**Post-choking care:**
- Even if object expelled, seek medical attention if:
  - Multiple abdominal thrusts performed
  - Difficulty swallowing persists
  - Persistent cough or throat pain
  - Feeling of something still in throat
  - Abdominal pain after thrusts
- Aspiration can cause delayed pneumonia

**What to tell 911:**
- Age of person
- Conscious or unconscious
- Partial or complete obstruction
- What object caused choking (if known)
- What you've done so far

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Prevention strategies:**

**For children:**
- Cut food into small pieces
- No round, firm foods for children under 4 (grapes, hot dogs, nuts)
- Supervise all meals
- No eating while running, playing, or in car
- Keep small objects out of reach
- Check toy labels for age-appropriate recommendations

**For adults:**
- Eat slowly, chew thoroughly
- Don't talk or laugh with full mouth
- Limit alcohol with meals (impairs gag reflex)
- Cut food into small pieces
- Ensure dentures fit properly
- Special precautions for swallowing disorders

**High-risk settings:**
- Nursing homes
- Preschools
- Restaurants
- Parties where people are drinking

**Training recommendations:**
- Everyone should learn choking response
- CPR/First Aid classes include hands-on practice
- Re-certification every 2 years recommended
- Practice on mannequins - never on people who aren't choking

**After successful response:**
- Person should still see healthcare provider
- Internal injuries possible from thrusts
- Aspiration may have occurred
- Underlying swallowing problems should be evaluated

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **"Are you choking?"** - If they can't answer, it's severe
2. **Don't interfere with effective coughing** - Let mild obstruction clear naturally
3. **Abdominal thrusts for adults/children, back blows + chest thrusts for infants**
4. **If person becomes unconscious, start CPR** - Compressions may dislodge object
5. **After clearing obstruction, seek medical evaluation** - Injuries may have occurred

## Summary

Choking is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate action. Recognize severe obstruction when the person cannot speak, cough effectively, or breathe. For adults and children over 1 year, perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) by standing behind and delivering upward thrusts until the object is expelled or the person becomes unconscious. For infants, alternate between 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts. If the person becomes unconscious, begin CPR and look in the mouth before each breath. Prevention includes cutting food into small pieces, supervising children during meals, and avoiding risky foods for young children.
