# Loss of Consciousness

## Overview
Loss of consciousness (LOC) occurs when a person is unresponsive and unaware of their surroundings. Causes range from fainting (usually brief and harmless) to life-threatening emergencies like cardiac arrest or stroke. The key is quickly determining if the person is breathing normally and responding appropriately. An unresponsive person who is not breathing normally needs CPR immediately.

## Recognizing Loss of Consciousness

### Level 1: Foundation
**Levels of unresponsiveness:**

- **Responsive**: Alert, awake, answers questions
- **Confused**: Awake but disoriented, slow to respond
- **Responds to voice**: Eyes open when spoken to
- **Responds to pain**: Only reacts to painful stimulus
- **Unresponsive**: No reaction to voice or pain

**Key assessment: Check for breathing**
- Is the person breathing normally?
- Occasional gasps are NOT normal breathing
- If not breathing normally: Begin CPR

**Types of LOC by duration:**
- **Fainting (syncope)**: Usually brief (seconds to minutes), person wakes up
- **Prolonged unconsciousness**: May indicate serious problem
- **No breathing/no pulse**: Cardiac arrest - immediate CPR needed

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Common causes of loss of consciousness:**

**Less serious (usually):**
- Fainting (vasovagal syncope): Heat, standing too long, emotional stress
- Low blood sugar (diabetic)
- Dehydration
- Hyperventilation
- Panic attack (rarely causes true unconsciousness)

**Serious:**
- Heart attack
- Stroke
- Seizure
- Head injury
- Severe allergic reaction
- Drug overdose
- Severe infection (sepsis)
- Cardiac arrhythmia

**Life-threatening:**
- Cardiac arrest
- Respiratory failure
- Severe trauma
- Anaphylaxis

**Key questions to determine cause:**
- Did the person fall or have trauma?
- Were there any warning signs before collapse?
- Was there any seizure activity?
- Is there a medical history? (diabetes, heart disease, epilepsy)
- Any medications or substances involved?

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Systematic assessment: The ABCD approach**

**A - Airway:**
- Is the airway open?
- Any visible obstructions?
- Position head to open airway (head-tilt chin-lift)

**B - Breathing:**
- Look for chest rise
- Listen for breath sounds
- Feel for air movement
- Is it normal breathing or just gasps?

**C - Circulation:**
- Check for pulse (if trained)
- Look for obvious bleeding
- Note skin color (pale, blue?)

**D - Disability/neurological:**
- Any response to voice?
- Any response to pain? (pinch shoulder)
- Pupils equal and reactive?

**Differentiating causes by associated signs:**

| Cause | Key Clues |
|-------|-----------|
| Fainting | Pale, sweaty before; wakes quickly; normal pulse |
| Seizure | Witnessed convulsions; confusion after; may bite tongue |
| Stroke | One-sided weakness; facial droop; speech problems |
| Cardiac | No pulse; cardiac history; chest pain before |
| Hypoglycemia | Diabetic; confused before unresponsive; sweaty |
| Overdose | Medications/drugs present; slow breathing; tiny pupils (opioids) |
| Head injury | Trauma mechanism; scalp wound; unequal pupils |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS):**
Medical professionals use this to quantify consciousness level:

| Component | Score | Response |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Eye Opening** | 4 | Spontaneous |
| | 3 | To voice |
| | 2 | To pain |
| | 1 | None |
| **Verbal Response** | 5 | Oriented |
| | 4 | Confused |
| | 3 | Inappropriate words |
| | 2 | Incomprehensible sounds |
| | 1 | None |
| **Motor Response** | 6 | Obeys commands |
| | 5 | Localizes pain |
| | 4 | Withdraws from pain |
| | 3 | Flexion to pain |
| | 2 | Extension to pain |
| | 1 | None |

**Total score interpretation:**
- 15: Fully conscious
- 13-14: Mild impairment
- 9-12: Moderate impairment
- 8 or less: Severe - coma, needs airway protection

**Abnormal breathing patterns:**

| Pattern | Description | Indicates |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Agonal gasps | Occasional, irregular gasps | Cardiac arrest - begin CPR |
| Cheyne-Stokes | Crescendo-decrescendo pattern | Brain injury, heart failure |
| Kussmaul | Deep, rapid | Metabolic acidosis (diabetic emergency) |
| Ataxic | Irregular, unpredictable | Brainstem injury |
| Apnea | No breathing | Respiratory arrest - ventilate |

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Specific emergency scenarios:**

**Opioid overdose:**
- Tiny (pinpoint) pupils
- Very slow or absent breathing
- Blue lips and fingernails
- Needle marks possible
- Naloxone (Narcan) can reverse
- Begin CPR if not breathing

**Diabetic emergencies:**

*Hypoglycemia (low sugar):*
- Known diabetic
- May have warning signs before LOC
- Sweaty, trembling initially
- If can swallow: Give sugar
- If can't swallow: Don't give anything by mouth

*Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA):*
- Very deep breathing
- Fruity breath odor
- Gradual onset
- Dehydration signs

**Post-seizure state (postictal):**
- Follows witnessed convulsions
- Gradual recovery over minutes to hours
- May be confused, sleepy
- May have bitten tongue
- May have lost bladder control
- Protect from injury, position on side

**Head injury with LOC:**
- Any loss of consciousness after head trauma is significant
- Watch for: Unequal pupils, clear fluid from nose/ears, worsening headache
- Keep spine aligned if trauma suspected
- Even brief LOC needs medical evaluation

**Cardiac causes:**
- May collapse suddenly without warning
- May have chest pain or shortness of breath before
- Check pulse - if absent, immediate CPR
- AED use as soon as available

## What to Do

### Level 1: Foundation
**Immediate steps:**
1. **Check for danger** - Make sure scene is safe
2. **Try to wake them** - Tap shoulder, shout "Are you okay?"
3. **Call 911** - If not responding
4. **Check breathing** - Is breathing normal?
5. **If not breathing normally** - Begin CPR
6. **If breathing normally** - Place in recovery position

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**The assessment sequence:**

**Step 1: Check responsiveness**
- Tap shoulder firmly
- Shout "Are you okay? Can you hear me?"
- If no response: Assume emergency

**Step 2: Call for help**
- Call 911 (or send someone)
- If alone with adult: Call first, then CPR
- If alone with child: 2 minutes CPR, then call
- Get AED if available

**Step 3: Check breathing**
- Open airway: Head-tilt chin-lift (unless trauma suspected)
- Look for chest rise
- Listen for breathing
- Feel for breath on your cheek
- Take no more than 10 seconds

**Step 4: Act based on breathing status**
- NOT breathing normally: Begin CPR
- Breathing normally: Recovery position

**Recovery position (for breathing, unresponsive person):**
1. Kneel beside person
2. Straighten legs
3. Place arm nearest you at right angle to body
4. Bring far arm across chest, hand against cheek
5. Grasp far leg above knee, pull up
6. Pull leg toward you to roll person on side
7. Adjust top leg for stability
8. Tilt head back to keep airway open

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**What to tell 911:**
- Person is unresponsive
- Whether they are breathing
- What happened (if known)
- Any injuries visible
- Any medical conditions known
- Location

**Information gathering while waiting:**
- Look for medical alert jewelry
- Ask bystanders what happened
- Note any medications nearby
- Time when found unresponsive
- Any changes in condition

**Special situations:**

**If person is known diabetic:**
- If can swallow: Give juice, candy, glucose tablets
- If cannot swallow: Do not give anything by mouth
- Call 911
- Stay with person

**If you suspect opioid overdose:**
- Call 911
- If naloxone (Narcan) available, give it
- Begin CPR if not breathing
- Naloxone wears off - person may become unresponsive again

**If seizure just ended:**
- Time the seizure if possible
- Don't restrain or put anything in mouth
- Protect from injury
- Place on side when convulsions stop
- Stay until fully alert
- Call 911 if: First seizure, lasts >5 minutes, doesn't wake up, injured, pregnant, diabetic

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**When breathing is questionable:**

If unsure whether breathing is normal:
- A few occasional gasps are NOT normal (agonal breathing)
- Snoring sounds may indicate obstructed airway
- Very slow breathing (<8/min) is inadequate
- When in doubt, start CPR - it won't harm someone who doesn't need it

**Maintaining airway:**
- Head-tilt chin-lift: Standard method
- Jaw thrust: If spinal injury suspected
- Suction: If vomiting occurs (turn on side if no equipment)

**During CPR:**
- Chest compressions at least 2 inches deep
- Rate of 100-120 compressions per minute
- Allow full chest recoil between compressions
- Minimize interruptions
- Switch rescuers every 2 minutes if possible

**AED use:**
- Turn on and follow voice prompts
- Apply pads as shown in pictures
- Don't touch person during analysis
- Clear everyone before shock
- Resume CPR immediately after shock

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Prognosis considerations:**

**Factors affecting outcome from cardiac arrest:**
- Time to CPR (every minute without CPR, survival decreases 7-10%)
- Time to defibrillation
- Cause of arrest
- Duration of arrest
- Quality of CPR
- Age and comorbidities

**Post-resuscitation care (hospital):**
- Targeted temperature management
- Hemodynamic optimization
- Respiratory support
- Neurological evaluation
- Treatment of underlying cause

**When to stop CPR (for laypersons):**
- When professional help arrives and takes over
- When you are physically exhausted and cannot continue
- When the scene becomes unsafe
- When person shows clear signs of life (breathing, movement)

**Documentation for EMS:**
- Time found unresponsive
- Time CPR started
- Number of AED shocks (if any)
- Any response to treatment
- Witnesses and what they observed
- Medications or substances involved

**After the event:**
- The rescuer may need emotional support
- Debriefing can be helpful
- Most cardiac arrests outside hospital are not survivable, even with perfect CPR
- You gave the person their best chance

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **No response + no normal breathing = CPR** - Don't wait, act immediately
2. **Agonal gasps are not breathing** - Start CPR
3. **Call 911 for any unresponsive person** - Even if they wake up
4. **Recovery position for breathing, unresponsive people** - Protects airway
5. **Get AED as soon as possible** - Early defibrillation saves lives

## Summary

Loss of consciousness requires immediate assessment of breathing. If the person is not breathing normally (including agonal gasps), begin CPR immediately and call 911. If they are breathing normally, place them in the recovery position and call 911. Look for causes: medical alert jewelry, medications, signs of trauma, or witness accounts. Common causes include fainting (brief, person wakes up), seizures, cardiac arrest, stroke, diabetic emergencies, and overdose. Never leave an unresponsive person alone. Even if someone wakes up after fainting, they should be evaluated medically to determine the cause.
