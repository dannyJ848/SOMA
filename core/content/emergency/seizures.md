# Seizures

## Overview
A seizure is a sudden, uncontrolled electrical disturbance in the brain. Seizures can cause changes in behavior, movements, feelings, and levels of consciousness. While most seizures last less than 5 minutes and stop on their own, prolonged seizures or certain situations (first seizure, injury, pregnancy) are medical emergencies. The primary role of a bystander is to keep the person safe and time the seizure.

## Recognizing Seizures

### Level 1: Foundation
**Types of seizures:**

**Generalized tonic-clonic ("grand mal"):**
- Sudden loss of consciousness
- Body stiffens (tonic phase)
- Rhythmic jerking movements (clonic phase)
- May cry out at start
- May bite tongue or lose bladder control
- Usually lasts 1-3 minutes

**Absence ("petit mal"):**
- Brief staring episodes (5-30 seconds)
- No response when spoken to
- May have subtle eye blinking or lip smacking
- No falling or convulsions
- Most common in children

**Focal (partial) seizures:**
- May or may not affect consciousness
- Jerking or twitching of one area (arm, face)
- Unusual sensations or feelings
- May progress to generalized seizure

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Phases of a tonic-clonic seizure:**

**1. Aura (warning phase - some people):**
- Strange feeling
- Unusual taste or smell
- Visual disturbances
- Deja vu feeling
- Lasts seconds to minutes before seizure

**2. Tonic phase (10-20 seconds):**
- Sudden loss of consciousness
- Body becomes rigid
- May fall to ground
- May cry out (air forced past vocal cords)
- May turn blue briefly

**3. Clonic phase (30-60 seconds usually):**
- Rhythmic jerking of arms and legs
- Jerking gradually slows then stops
- May bite tongue (usually side)
- May lose bladder or bowel control
- Excessive saliva/foaming

**4. Postictal phase (minutes to hours):**
- Confusion, disorientation
- Fatigue, sleepiness
- Headache
- Muscle soreness
- May not remember seizure
- Gradual return to normal

**What seizures look like vs. common misconceptions:**
- NOT always dramatic convulsions
- Person doesn't "swallow their tongue"
- May be subtle (staring, lip smacking, confusion)
- Color changes are common (may turn blue briefly)
- Incontinence is common and nothing to be embarrassed about

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**When seizures are emergencies - call 911 if:**

- First seizure ever
- Seizure lasts more than 5 minutes
- Person doesn't wake up after seizure
- Another seizure starts shortly after
- Person is injured during seizure
- Person is pregnant
- Person is diabetic
- Seizure happens in water
- Person has difficulty breathing after
- You're unsure if it's a seizure

**Common seizure triggers:**
- Missed anti-seizure medications (most common)
- Sleep deprivation
- Stress
- Alcohol withdrawal
- Flashing lights (rare, but possible)
- Fever (especially in children - febrile seizures)
- Illness or infection
- Low blood sugar
- Drug use
- Menstruation (catamenial epilepsy)

**Differentiating seizures from other conditions:**

| Condition | Key Differences |
|-----------|----------------|
| Fainting | Brief loss of consciousness, no jerking, rapid recovery |
| Cardiac arrhythmia | May have jerking but caused by lack of blood flow |
| Psychogenic non-epileptic | Eyes often closed, irregular movements, longer duration |
| Hypoglycemia | May have some jerking, responds to sugar if caught early |
| Drug reaction | Associated with recent medication or substance use |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Status epilepticus:**
A medical emergency defined as:
- Seizure lasting more than 5 minutes, OR
- Two or more seizures without full recovery between

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Brain uses enormous energy during seizures
- Oxygen demand exceeds supply
- Body temperature rises
- Can cause permanent brain damage
- Can be fatal

**Treatment requires:**
- Immediate benzodiazepines (hospital or EMS)
- Airway management
- IV access
- Continuous monitoring
- Intensive care often needed

**Seizure complications:**

| Complication | Prevention/Management |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Tongue bite | Cannot prevent during seizure; don't put anything in mouth |
| Head injury | Cushion head, move objects away |
| Aspiration | Position on side after seizure stops |
| Fractures/dislocations | Move furniture away, protect from falls |
| Hypoxia | Usually brief, recovers after seizure |

**Postictal state variations:**
- **Todd's paralysis**: Temporary weakness on one side (hours)
- **Postictal psychosis**: Confusion, agitation, even hallucinations
- **Postictal aphasia**: Difficulty speaking
- All are temporary and resolve

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Special seizure situations:**

**Febrile seizures (children 6 months to 5 years):**
- Triggered by fever, not infection of brain
- Usually brief (<15 minutes) and harmless
- Does not cause brain damage
- Does not usually mean child has epilepsy
- Still call doctor after first febrile seizure

**Seizures in pregnancy (eclampsia):**
- Medical emergency
- Associated with preeclampsia (high blood pressure in pregnancy)
- Dangerous for mother and baby
- Requires immediate delivery usually
- Call 911 immediately

**Alcohol withdrawal seizures:**
- Occur 24-72 hours after last drink
- High risk of status epilepticus
- May progress to delirium tremens
- Medical supervision needed for detox

**Seizures in diabetics:**
- May be from low blood sugar
- Check glucose if possible
- If low and person is conscious: Give sugar
- If unconscious: 911, position safely

**Breakthrough seizures (known epilepsy):**
- May indicate subtherapeutic medication levels
- Could be from missed doses
- May need medication adjustment
- Should contact neurologist

**Anti-seizure medications:**
Common medications include:
- Levetiracetam (Keppra)
- Phenytoin (Dilantin)
- Valproate (Depakote)
- Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
- Lamotrigine (Lamictal)

Important points:
- Never stop suddenly (can trigger seizures)
- Blood levels may need monitoring
- Drug interactions common
- Side effects vary by medication

## What to Do

### Level 1: Foundation
**During a seizure:**
1. **Stay calm** - Most seizures end on their own
2. **Time the seizure** - Call 911 if more than 5 minutes
3. **Protect from injury** - Move hard/sharp objects away
4. **Cushion the head** - Place something soft under head
5. **Don't restrain** - Let the seizure happen
6. **Don't put anything in mouth** - No fingers, no objects

**After seizure stops:**
- Turn person on their side (recovery position)
- Stay with them until fully alert
- Speak calmly and reassuringly
- Check for injuries

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Step-by-step response:**

**When seizure begins:**
1. Note the time
2. Help person to ground if standing
3. Clear area of dangerous objects
4. Place something soft under head (jacket, pillow)
5. Loosen tight clothing around neck
6. Do NOT try to hold them down

**During seizure:**
- Stay with person
- Time the seizure
- Observe what happens (helpful for doctors)
- Speak calmly if they seem aware
- Keep others back

**When jerking stops:**
1. Check for breathing
2. Turn on side (recovery position)
3. Check mouth for food/vomit (only wipe away what you can see)
4. Stay until fully alert
5. Don't give food or water until fully awake

**Do NOT:**
- Put anything in their mouth
- Try to hold them still
- Give CPR during the seizure (they are breathing)
- Leave them alone
- Give food or drink until fully alert

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**What to observe and report:**
- What were they doing before?
- Did they have any warning?
- What did the seizure look like?
- Which body parts moved?
- Did they lose consciousness?
- How long did it last?
- How long until they were back to normal?
- Any injuries?
- Did they lose bladder/bowel control?

**Recovery position:**
1. Extend arm closest to you straight out
2. Place far arm across chest with hand under cheek
3. Bend far knee
4. Roll person toward you onto their side
5. Adjust hand under cheek to keep airway open
6. Make sure they can't roll onto face

**When to call 911:**

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| First seizure | Need evaluation for cause |
| Lasts >5 minutes | Risk of status epilepticus |
| No recovery between seizures | Status epilepticus |
| Doesn't wake up | May need airway protection |
| Injury during seizure | May need treatment |
| Pregnancy | Eclampsia risk |
| Diabetes | May be low blood sugar |
| In water | Drowning risk |
| Difficulty breathing after | Airway may be compromised |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**For known epileptics with rescue medication:**

**Rectal diazepam (Diastat):**
- Given for prolonged or cluster seizures
- Family/caregiver can administer
- Comes in pre-filled applicator
- Given as directed by neurologist

**Intranasal midazolam (Nayzilam):**
- Newer rescue medication
- Sprayed in nose
- Can be given during seizure
- Easier to administer than rectal

**Buccal midazolam:**
- Placed inside cheek
- Absorbed through mouth lining
- Available in some countries

**When to use rescue medications:**
- As directed by neurologist
- Usually for seizures lasting >2-3 minutes
- When seizures are clustering
- According to seizure action plan

**After using rescue medication:**
- Stay with person
- Monitor breathing
- Call 911 if directed in plan
- Document time and response

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Seizure action plans:**

People with epilepsy should have written plans that include:
- Usual seizure pattern
- When to give rescue medication
- When to call 911
- Emergency contacts
- Current medications
- Healthcare provider contacts

**Safety considerations for people with epilepsy:**
- Bathing: Showers preferred over baths
- Swimming: Never alone, always with supervision
- Driving: Regulations vary by location
- Heights: Avoid unsecured heights
- Machinery: Safety guards, supervision
- Cooking: Use back burners, microwave when possible

**When someone doesn't recover normally:**
Signs that need emergency evaluation:
- Confusion lasting more than 30 minutes
- Persistent weakness
- Fever
- Severe headache
- Never returns to baseline
- Signs of head injury

**Post-seizure care:**
- Rest - seizures are exhausting
- Hydration
- No driving until cleared
- Contact neurologist about breakthrough seizures
- Medication compliance review
- Trigger identification and avoidance

**Emotional support:**
- Seizures can be frightening and embarrassing
- Reassure person after they wake up
- Give them privacy to clean up if needed
- Offer to contact someone for them
- Don't make a big scene

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Time the seizure** - More than 5 minutes = call 911
2. **Protect, don't restrain** - Move objects away, cushion head
3. **Nothing in the mouth** - They won't swallow their tongue
4. **Recovery position after** - Turn on side when jerking stops
5. **Stay until fully alert** - They will be confused; reassure them

## Summary

Seizures are sudden electrical disturbances in the brain causing changes in movement, consciousness, and behavior. Most seizures last 1-3 minutes and stop on their own. The bystander's role is to keep the person safe: time the seizure, move dangerous objects away, cushion the head, and never put anything in the mouth. After jerking stops, turn the person on their side (recovery position) and stay until fully alert. Call 911 if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, the person doesn't wake up, another seizure starts, this is their first seizure, they're pregnant or diabetic, or if they're injured. Seizures are followed by a postictal period of confusion and fatigue that is normal and gradually improves.
