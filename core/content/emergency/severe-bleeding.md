# Severe Bleeding

## Overview
Severe bleeding (hemorrhage) is a life-threatening emergency. Blood loss of 1-2 liters (about 20-40% of blood volume) can lead to shock, and losing 40% or more can be fatal within minutes. Rapid response with direct pressure and, when appropriate, tourniquet application can save lives. The goal is to stop the bleeding as quickly as possible while calling for emergency help.

## Recognizing Severe Bleeding

### Level 1: Foundation
**Signs of severe bleeding:**

**Visible signs:**
- Blood pooling on ground
- Blood-soaked clothing
- Blood spurting (arterial)
- Continuous flow of blood (venous)
- Obvious traumatic amputation

**Signs of blood loss (shock):**
- Pale, cool, clammy skin
- Rapid, weak pulse
- Rapid, shallow breathing
- Confusion or decreased alertness
- Weakness or feeling faint
- Thirst
- Nausea

**Key point**: Severe bleeding can kill in minutes. Stop the bleeding first, then call 911 (or have someone call while you apply pressure).

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Types of bleeding:**

| Type | Characteristics | Severity |
|------|----------------|----------|
| Arterial | Spurting, bright red, in rhythm with heartbeat | Most severe |
| Venous | Steady flow, dark red | Serious |
| Capillary | Oozing, slow | Usually minor |

**Estimated blood loss by appearance:**
- Small pool (dinner plate size): ~500 mL (1 pint)
- Medium pool (floor tile size): ~1000 mL (1 quart)
- Large pool (doormat size): ~2000+ mL (1/2 gallon)
- Blood-soaked clothing can be deceiving - clothes absorb significant blood

**Critical blood loss thresholds:**
- Adult blood volume: ~5 liters (10.5 pints)
- 15% loss (~750 mL): May feel light-headed
- 30% loss (~1500 mL): Significant symptoms, needs intervention
- 40% loss (~2000 mL): Life-threatening, imminent cardiac arrest

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Assessment priorities:**

1. **Scene safety first**: Look for hazards before approaching
2. **Identify source**: Locate where blood is coming from
3. **Assess severity**: Spurting, pooling, soaking?
4. **Apply immediate control**: Direct pressure or tourniquet
5. **Call 911**: As soon as immediate bleeding control applied

**When to use tourniquet vs. direct pressure:**

| Situation | Intervention |
|-----------|--------------|
| Arm or leg bleeding, can't control with pressure | Tourniquet |
| Traumatic amputation | Tourniquet immediately |
| Multiple wounds, can't cover all | Tourniquet limbs, pressure on others |
| Trunk or neck bleeding | Direct pressure only (no tourniquet) |
| Penetrating object in wound | Pressure around object, don't remove |

**High-risk bleeding locations:**
- Neck: Risk of airway compromise
- Groin/femoral: Large artery, rapid blood loss
- Axilla (armpit): Difficult to compress
- Abdomen: Often internal, visible bleeding may be small
- Scalp: Bleeds heavily even from minor wounds

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Physiology of blood loss:**

**Compensated shock:**
- Body redirects blood to vital organs
- Heart rate increases
- Peripheral vessels constrict
- Blood pressure maintained initially
- Person conscious and alert

**Decompensated shock:**
- Compensation failing
- Blood pressure drops
- Altered mental status
- Cool, mottled extremities
- Rapid deterioration imminent

**Signs of shock progression:**

| Parameter | Early Shock | Late Shock |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| Heart rate | Increased | Very rapid or decreasing |
| Blood pressure | Normal or slightly low | Very low |
| Respirations | Increased | Rapid and shallow |
| Skin | Pale, cool | Cold, mottled, cyanotic |
| Mental status | Anxious | Confused or unresponsive |
| Urine output | Decreased | None |

**Internal bleeding indicators:**
- Mechanism of injury suggests internal damage
- Pain and tenderness without visible wound
- Rigid or distended abdomen
- Blood in vomit, stool, or urine
- Signs of shock without visible blood loss
- Bruising patterns (seat belt sign, Grey Turner sign)

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Special considerations:**

**Anticoagulant medications:**
- Warfarin, Eliquis, Xarelto, Pradaxa, aspirin, clopidogrel
- Bleeding more difficult to control
- Inform EMS immediately
- May need reversal agents at hospital
- Apply more aggressive bleeding control

**Hemophilia and bleeding disorders:**
- Prolonged bleeding from minor wounds
- Joint and muscle bleeds
- Need factor replacement
- Inform EMS of condition
- Emergency treatment plan may be in place

**Pregnancy:**
- Blood volume increased 30-50%
- May tolerate more blood loss initially
- Signs of shock may be late
- Fetus at risk before mother shows symptoms
- Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy is always urgent

**Wound packing for deep wounds:**
- For deep, narrow wounds where pressure alone won't work
- Pack wound tightly with clean cloth or gauze
- Push material into wound to apply pressure from inside
- Continue adding material until wound is packed
- Apply pressure on top

**Junctional hemorrhage (groin, axilla, shoulder):**
- Tourniquet cannot be applied
- Requires wound packing
- Special devices exist (junctional tourniquets)
- Maximum direct pressure
- Very high mortality without intervention

## What to Do

### Level 1: Foundation
**Immediate actions:**
1. **Ensure scene safety** - Don't become another victim
2. **Apply direct pressure** - Use clean cloth, press firmly on wound
3. **Call 911** (or have someone call)
4. **Don't remove pressure** - Keep pressing even if blood soaks through
5. **Add more material** - Don't remove blood-soaked cloths, add on top

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Direct pressure technique:**

1. **Get something absorbent:**
   - Clean cloth, towel, shirt
   - Gauze if available
   - Sanitary pad or diaper (highly absorbent)
   - Your hand (with gloves if possible)

2. **Apply pressure:**
   - Place material directly on wound
   - Push down firmly with palm of hand
   - Maintain constant pressure
   - Don't peek - just keep pressing

3. **If blood soaks through:**
   - Do NOT remove original material
   - Add more cloth on top
   - Apply more pressure

4. **Maintain pressure:**
   - At least 10-15 minutes for clotting to begin
   - Don't let up to check
   - Continue until EMS arrives

**Position for bleeding control:**
- Lie person down
- Elevate injured limb if possible (above heart level)
- Keep person warm (cover with blanket)
- Keep person calm

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**When and how to apply a tourniquet:**

**When to use:**
- Life-threatening bleeding from arm or leg
- Direct pressure not controlling bleeding
- Multiple casualties and limited help
- Cannot access wound (trapped limb)
- Traumatic amputation

**How to apply:**
1. **Position**: 2-3 inches above wound (not on joint)
2. **Wrap around limb**: Twice if possible
3. **Insert windlass** (rod or stick)
4. **Twist windlass** until bleeding stops
5. **Secure windlass** in place
6. **Note the time** applied
7. **Do NOT remove** once applied

**Improvised tourniquet:**
- Belt, tie, scarf, bandana
- Needs to be at least 1-1.5 inches wide
- Thin materials (like shoelaces) cause tissue damage
- Must be tight enough to completely stop blood flow
- Commercial tourniquets far more effective

**Signs tourniquet is working:**
- Bleeding has stopped
- No pulse felt below tourniquet
- Distal limb becomes pale
- Person will feel pain at tourniquet site

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Bleeding control sequence:**
1. Direct pressure (first line for all wounds)
2. Wound packing (deep wounds)
3. Tourniquet (extremity, life-threatening)
4. Hemostatic agents (if available)

**Hemostatic agents:**
- QuikClot, Celox, HemCon
- Promote rapid clotting
- Apply directly into wound
- Still require pressure
- Available in first aid kits

**Wound packing technique:**
1. Open wound to see where bleeding is coming from
2. Take clean cloth or gauze
3. Push material firmly into wound
4. Pack tightly from bottom to top
5. Fill entire wound cavity
6. Apply direct pressure on top
7. Maintain for 3-5 minutes minimum

**What to tell 911:**
- Location
- What happened (mechanism)
- Number of injured people
- Current condition (conscious, breathing)
- What you've done (tourniquet, pressure)
- If blood thinners taken
- How much blood loss estimated

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Special wound situations:**

**Objects impaled in wound:**
- Do NOT remove
- Stabilize object in place with bulky dressings
- Apply pressure around object
- Hospital removal only (surgical control of bleeding)

**Abdominal wounds with evisceration:**
- Do NOT push organs back in
- Cover with moist, clean cloth
- Cover moist cloth with plastic/waterproof layer
- Keep warm
- Urgent surgical emergency

**Neck wounds:**
- Apply pressure but don't compress both sides (blocks airway)
- Occlude wound to prevent air embolism
- Use occlusive dressing if available

**Scalp wounds:**
- Apply firm, direct pressure
- May need to hold wound edges together
- Bleeds heavily but rarely life-threatening in isolation
- Consider skull fracture if mechanism suggests

**Post-bleeding control care:**
- Keep person lying flat
- Elevate legs if possible (unless spinal injury suspected)
- Keep warm (blood loss causes hypothermia)
- Nothing to eat or drink (may need surgery)
- Reassure constantly
- Monitor for shock

**If person becomes unresponsive:**
- Maintain bleeding control if possible
- Check for breathing
- Begin CPR if not breathing normally
- Continue until EMS arrives

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Stop the bleed** - Direct pressure first for almost all bleeding
2. **Don't peek** - Lifting pressure disrupts clot formation
3. **Add, don't remove** - If blood soaks through, add material on top
4. **Tourniquet saves lives** - When limb bleeding is severe, use it
5. **Note the time** - When tourniquet applied, time matters

---

## Summary

Severe bleeding is a life-threatening emergency where rapid action saves lives. Apply direct pressure with a clean cloth immediately - push hard and don't let up. If blood soaks through, add more material on top without removing the original. For severe limb bleeding that cannot be controlled with pressure, apply a tourniquet 2-3 inches above the wound and tighten until bleeding stops. Call 911 as soon as immediate bleeding control is achieved. Position the person lying down with legs elevated and keep them warm while waiting for emergency services. Time is critical - significant blood loss can occur in minutes.
