# Stroke Recognition (FAST)

## Overview
A stroke occurs when blood supply to the brain is interrupted, either by a blockage (ischemic stroke - 87%) or bleeding (hemorrhagic stroke - 13%). Brain cells begin dying within minutes, making stroke a medical emergency. The FAST acronym helps identify stroke symptoms quickly. Acting within the first hours dramatically improves outcomes.

## The FAST Assessment

### Level 1: Foundation
**FAST - Remember these signs:**

- **F - Face drooping**: Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop or feel numb?
- **A - Arm weakness**: Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?
- **S - Speech difficulty**: Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence. Is speech slurred or strange?
- **T - Time to call 911**: If you observe any of these signs, call 911 immediately

**Key point**: Even if symptoms go away, call 911. "Mini-strokes" (TIAs) often precede major strokes.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Additional stroke warning signs:**

Beyond FAST, watch for:
- Sudden confusion or trouble understanding speech
- Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
- Sudden severe headache with no known cause
- Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
- Sudden numbness or weakness in face, arm, or leg, especially on one side

**What FAST symptoms look like:**

**Face drooping:**
- One side of mouth droops when smiling
- Face looks uneven or lopsided
- Numbness on one side of face
- Difficulty closing one eye

**Arm weakness:**
- Cannot raise one arm as high as the other
- One arm drifts down when both are raised
- Weakness or numbness on one side
- Cannot grip objects with one hand

**Speech difficulty:**
- Slurred speech (sounds drunk)
- Mixing up or using wrong words
- Cannot repeat simple phrases correctly
- Difficulty understanding what you're saying

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Types of stroke:**

**Ischemic stroke (87%):**
- Blockage in blood vessel to brain
- Treatable with clot-busting medication (tPA) within 4.5 hours
- Mechanical clot removal possible up to 24 hours in some cases
- Faster treatment = better outcomes

**Hemorrhagic stroke (13%):**
- Bleeding in or around the brain
- Treatment is different (NOT clot-busters)
- May require surgery to relieve pressure
- Often caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure

**Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) - "Mini-stroke":**
- Same symptoms as stroke but resolve within minutes to hours
- WARNING: High risk of full stroke within days
- Requires emergency evaluation even if symptoms gone
- Up to 20% have stroke within 90 days without treatment

**Stroke mimics (conditions that look like stroke):**
- Seizures
- Migraine with aura
- Low blood sugar
- Brain tumors
- Medication effects
- Inner ear problems

**When to suspect stroke:**
- Sudden onset of symptoms (within seconds to minutes)
- Symptoms affect one side of body primarily
- No clear other explanation
- Especially with stroke risk factors present

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Expanded assessment (BE-FAST):**

**B - Balance**: Sudden loss of balance or coordination
**E - Eyes**: Sudden vision changes, double vision, or vision loss

This expanded version catches additional stroke presentations.

**Time windows for treatment:**

| Treatment | Time Window | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| IV tPA | Up to 4.5 hours | "Clot-busting" medication |
| Mechanical thrombectomy | Up to 24 hours | Physical clot removal (select patients) |
| Optimal treatment zone | Within 60 minutes | Best outcomes |

**The "Golden Hour":**
- Treatment within 60 minutes of symptom onset yields best results
- Every 15-minute delay reduces benefit by 10%
- "Time is brain" - approximately 1.9 million neurons die every minute during stroke

**Why calling 911 matters:**
- EMS can alert stroke center to prepare
- Reduces time to treatment by 30-60 minutes
- Stroke team assembled before arrival
- CT scan ready when you arrive

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Stroke severity and localization:**

**Anterior circulation (Carotid territory):**
- Face, arm weakness
- Speech problems (if left side of brain)
- Visual field cuts
- Neglect (ignoring one side of space)

**Posterior circulation (Vertebrobasilar):**
- Double vision
- Severe dizziness/vertigo
- Coordination problems
- Difficulty swallowing
- Severe headache (especially with hemorrhagic)

**NIH Stroke Scale components:**
Medical professionals use this 15-item scale:
- Level of consciousness
- Gaze
- Visual fields
- Facial palsy
- Motor arm
- Motor leg
- Limb ataxia
- Sensory
- Language
- Dysarthria
- Extinction/Inattention

**Wake-up strokes:**
- Symptom onset unknown (during sleep)
- Special imaging can identify salvageable brain tissue
- May still be candidates for treatment
- MRI with perfusion imaging guides decisions

**Large vessel occlusion (LVO):**
- Blockage in major brain arteries
- Candidates for mechanical thrombectomy
- May need transfer to comprehensive stroke center
- Time window extended for these procedures

## What to Do

### Level 1: Foundation
**If you suspect stroke:**
1. **Note the time** - When did symptoms start?
2. **Call 911 immediately** - Say "I think this is a stroke"
3. **Do not give food or water** - Swallowing may be impaired
4. **Keep person calm and lying flat** (unless vomiting, then on side)
5. **Do not let them "sleep it off"** - This is not fatigue

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**What to tell 911:**
- "I think this person is having a stroke"
- Time symptoms started (CRITICAL)
- Specific symptoms you observed
- Person's age and medical conditions
- Current medications, especially blood thinners
- Person's weight (for medication dosing)

**While waiting for EMS:**
- Stay with the person
- Keep them calm and comfortable
- Loosen tight clothing
- If vomiting or unconscious: Turn on side
- Be ready to perform CPR if they stop breathing
- Gather medications to bring to hospital
- Note any changes in symptoms

**What NOT to do:**
- Do NOT give aspirin (could be hemorrhagic stroke)
- Do NOT give food or water
- Do NOT let them "wait and see"
- Do NOT drive to hospital yourself if possible
- Do NOT let them go to sleep hoping symptoms resolve

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Critical information for hospital:**
- **Last known well time** - When was person last normal?
- Blood thinners or anticoagulants (warfarin, Eliquis, Xarelto, etc.)
- Recent surgeries or bleeding
- Medical history (especially previous strokes, heart conditions)
- Current medications

**Special considerations:**

**If symptoms resolve before EMS arrives:**
- Still go to hospital - TIA is a stroke warning
- Do not cancel ambulance
- Risk of major stroke is highest in next 24-48 hours
- Evaluation and treatment can prevent full stroke

**If multiple symptoms:**
- Document all symptoms and timing
- Symptoms may fluctuate
- Report the worst symptoms

**If on blood thinners:**
- Tell EMS immediately
- Treatment options may differ
- May need reversal agents

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**What happens at the hospital:**

**Immediate actions:**
- CT scan within 25 minutes of arrival
- Blood tests (glucose, platelets, coagulation)
- Blood pressure monitoring
- Neurological assessment

**Treatment decisions:**
- CT determines if ischemic or hemorrhagic
- If ischemic and within time window: tPA considered
- If large vessel blockage: Consider thrombectomy
- If hemorrhagic: Control bleeding, manage pressure

**Stroke center levels:**

**Primary Stroke Center:**
- IV tPA capability
- Neurological expertise
- CT imaging
- Stroke unit

**Comprehensive Stroke Center:**
- All primary center capabilities PLUS:
- Mechanical thrombectomy
- Neurosurgery
- Advanced imaging
- ICU care
- Complex stroke care

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Recovery and rehabilitation:**

**Immediate post-stroke (hours to days):**
- ICU or stroke unit monitoring
- Prevention of complications
- Swallowing evaluation
- Physical/occupational therapy evaluation
- Speech therapy if needed

**Brain plasticity:**
- Brain can rewire around damaged areas
- Most recovery occurs in first 3-6 months
- Continued improvement possible for years
- Intensive rehabilitation crucial

**Secondary prevention:**
- Identify stroke cause
- Blood thinners for certain causes
- Blood pressure control (most important)
- Cholesterol management
- Diabetes control
- Smoking cessation
- Treatment of underlying heart conditions

**Risk of recurrence:**
- 5-14% in first year without treatment
- Reduced by 80% with appropriate prevention
- Lifelong medication often required
- Regular follow-up essential

**Warning signs of another stroke:**
- Any return of original symptoms
- New neurological symptoms
- TIA symptoms (even if brief)
- Severe headache unlike previous headaches

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **FAST is a screening tool, not diagnostic** - All sudden neurological symptoms need evaluation
2. **Note the time** - "Last known well" determines treatment options
3. **TIAs are emergencies** - Brief symptoms still require immediate evaluation
4. **Don't give aspirin** - Could worsen hemorrhagic stroke
5. **Call 911, don't drive** - Stroke centers are alerted and prepared

## Summary

Stroke is a brain attack requiring immediate emergency response. Use FAST (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty, Time to call 911) to quickly identify stroke symptoms. Every minute matters - 1.9 million brain cells die each minute during stroke. Call 911 immediately, note when symptoms started, and do not give food, water, or aspirin. Even if symptoms resolve (TIA), emergency evaluation is critical as full stroke risk is extremely high. Treatment within the first hours can dramatically reduce disability and save lives.
