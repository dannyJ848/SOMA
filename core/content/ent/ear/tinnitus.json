      "summary": "Tinnitus is when you hear sounds in your ears or head that are not coming from outside - like ringing, buzzing, or humming.",
      "explanation": "Tinnitus is the experience of hearing sound when there is no actual sound around you. The sound might be ringing, buzzing, hissing, humming, or even clicking. It can be in one ear, both ears, or seem like it is inside your head. Almost everyone has brief tinnitus occasionally, but for some people it lasts a long time and can be bothersome. Tinnitus is not a disease itself but a symptom that something is happening with your hearing system. Common causes include exposure to loud noise, earwax buildup, age-related hearing loss, and some medications. Most tinnitus is not dangerous, but it is important to have it checked, especially if it is in one ear only, comes with dizziness, or affects your hearing. While there is no cure for most tinnitus, many treatments can help make it less noticeable and less distressing.",

      "summary": "Tinnitus is a perceived sound without external stimulus, classified as subjective (heard only by patient) or objective (can be heard by examiner), with numerous potential causes.",
      "explanation": "Subjective tinnitus (>99% of cases) is perceived only by the patient and usually associated with hearing loss of any type. Common causes include noise-induced hearing loss, presbycusis, cerumen impaction, otosclerosis, Meniere's disease, ototoxic medications (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, loop diuretics, chemotherapy), acoustic neuroma, and head/neck trauma. Objective tinnitus can be heard by an examiner using a stethoscope, suggesting vascular (arterial bruit, venous hum, dural arteriovenous fistula) or muscular causes (palatal myoclonus, middle ear muscle spasm). Pulsatile tinnitus synchronous with heartbeat requires vascular imaging. Evaluation includes comprehensive audiometry, tinnitus pitch and loudness matching, and imaging if indicated (MRI for unilateral tinnitus, MRA/CT angiography for pulsatile). Treatment focuses on addressing underlying causes, hearing aids for hearing loss (which often reduces tinnitus), sound therapy (masking, enrichment), and cognitive behavioral therapy for distress management.",

      "summary": "Tinnitus management requires systematic evaluation, exclusion of concerning etiologies, and multimodal treatment addressing auditory, psychological, and neuroplastic components.",
      "explanation": "Tinnitus evaluation includes: history (onset, duration, laterality, quality, pitch, pulsatility, modifying factors, medication review), audiometry (hearing loss pattern, threshold shift), otoscopy, and assessment of impact (Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Tinnitus Functional Index). Red flags requiring imaging: unilateral tinnitus, asymmetric hearing loss, pulsatile character, neurological symptoms. MRI with contrast evaluates for vestibular schwannoma; pulsatile tinnitus workup includes MRA, CT temporal bones, and potentially angiography. Somatosensory tinnitus (modulated by jaw/neck movement) may respond to physical therapy. Evidence-based treatments include: hearing aids (amplification reduces central gain), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT - strongest evidence for reducing distress), tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT - habituation through counseling and sound generators), and sound enrichment. Medications (antidepressants, anxiolytics) address comorbid conditions but do not directly treat tinnitus. Neuromodulation approaches (repetitive TMS, cochlear implants for profound loss with tinnitus) are emerging.",

      "summary": "Tinnitus pathophysiology involves peripheral deafferentation triggering maladaptive central plasticity, with limbic and attentional networks determining distress severity.",
      "explanation": "Contemporary tinnitus models emphasize central rather than peripheral mechanisms. Cochlear damage causes reduced auditory nerve input (deafferentation), leading to: increased spontaneous firing in dorsal cochlear nucleus, altered tonotopic maps in auditory cortex, and homeostatic upregulation of central gain in inferior colliculus. Tinnitus perception requires engagement of non-auditory networks: limbic system (amygdala, hippocampus) for emotional salience, prefrontal cortex for attention, and default mode network for conscious perception. The degree of limbic involvement determines tinnitus distress independent of loudness. Cochlear synaptopathy (hidden hearing loss) may explain tinnitus with normal audiogram - preferential loss of low-spontaneous-rate fibers alters central processing. Somatosensory modulation occurs via trigeminal and cervical inputs to dorsal cochlear nucleus, explaining associations with temporomandibular disorders. Hyperacusis (reduced sound tolerance) frequently co-occurs, suggesting shared gain dysfunction. Understanding these mechanisms informs targeted interventions: CBT addresses limbic/attentional components, neuromodulation targets cortical hyperactivity.",

      "clinicalNotes": "Extended high-frequency audiometry may reveal cochlear damage not seen on standard testing. Loudness discomfort levels assess hyperacusis. Limbic involvement in tinnitus distress supports psychologically-oriented treatments. Somatic modulation testing: check if jaw clench, neck rotation, or gaze direction alters tinnitus."

      "summary": "Advanced tinnitus research explores biomarkers, precision medicine phenotyping, novel neuromodulation approaches, and pharmacologic targets based on molecular mechanisms.",
      "explanation": "Tinnitus heterogeneity necessitates subtyping for precision treatment: proposed phenotypes include somatosensory-modulated, hyperacusis-associated, hearing loss-related, and psychological distress-dominant. Biomarker research uses EEG (gamma oscillation abnormalities, reduced alpha power), fMRI (limbic hyperconnectivity, auditory-attention network alterations), and pupillometry (autonomic reactivity). Neuromodulation advances include bimodal stimulation combining sound with vagal nerve or somatosensory stimulation, targeting spike-timing-dependent plasticity to restore normal neural synchrony. Repetitive TMS over auditory cortex shows modest efficacy; transcranial direct current stimulation and invasive approaches remain investigational. Pharmacologic research targets: potassium channel modulators (Kv7, addressing dorsal cochlear nucleus hyperactivity), GABA enhancers, NMDA antagonists, and neurotrophic agents. Gene therapy for underlying hearing loss may prevent or reverse tinnitus. Regenerative approaches restoring hair cells could address the peripheral trigger. Smartphone-based sound therapy apps offer accessible treatment delivery, with research on personalized spectra based on tinnitus pitch. Artificial intelligence applications include treatment response prediction and therapy optimization.",
