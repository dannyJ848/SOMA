      explanation: `## What Are Family Medicine Boards?

Family medicine boards are special tests for doctors who care for entire families. These doctors are called "family physicians" and they treat people of all ages.

## What Do Family Physicians Do?

Family physicians are doctors who:
- Care for babies, children, adults, and elderly people
- Treat many different types of health problems
- Help families stay healthy and prevent disease
- Know about all parts of the body and mind

## Why Are Family Doctors Special?

Unlike other doctors who focus on one area, family doctors:
- Know about pediatrics (children)
- Understand adult medicine
- Can care for pregnant women
- Help with mental health
- Know about surgery basics

## The Test Basics

- Taken after finishing 3 years of family medicine training
- Computer-based with multiple choice questions
- Covers health problems for all ages
- Tests both knowledge and practical skills

## Topics Covered

The test includes questions about:
- Children's health and development
- Women's health and pregnancy
- Adult diseases
- Elderly care
- Mental health
- Emergency situations
- Preventive care (staying healthy)

## After Passing

When doctors pass, they are "board-certified family physicians." This means they can provide comprehensive care for patients throughout their entire lives.`,

      clinicalNotes: `Expert perspective on ABFM certification:

1. **Scope Reality:** Practice scope varies widely in family medicine. The exam tests the full possible scope, but continuous certification allows focus on actual practice areas.

2. **Modular Advantage:** Use the modular format strategically. Schedule modules when prepared, take breaks to maintain focus, and complete over days if needed.

3. **Preventive Care Emphasis:** Family medicine is uniquely preventive-care focused. Know screening guidelines thoroughly - they are heavily tested.

4. **Procedural Competency:** Maintain procedures relevant to your practice. Volume matters for competency; don't maintain certifications for procedures you don't perform.

5. **Continuous Certification Benefits:** View CME, self-assessment, and PI as professional development opportunities, not burdens. They improve practice quality.

6. **Patient-Centered Approach:** The exam tests not just knowledge but patient-centered decision-making. Consider patient values, preferences, and social context.

7. **Life-Long Perspective:** Family medicine questions often require considering the patient's life stage, family context, and longitudinal care needs.

8. **Team-Based Integration:** Understand your role in team-based care, delegation appropriately, and know when specialty referral is indicated.

9. **Community Context:** Consider community resources, social determinants, and population health in clinical decisions.

10. **Specialty Pride:** Family medicine's breadth is its strength. Embrace the challenge of knowing "a lot about a lot" rather than "everything about one thing."`,
