      clinicalNotes: `Expert perspective on ABIM certification:

1. **Strategic Preparation:** Focus on high-yield topics while maintaining broad knowledge. Cardiovascular, GI, and pulmonary diseases represent over one-third of the exam.

2. **Question Practice Volume:** Most successful candidates complete 3,000-5,000 practice questions. Quality of review matters more than quantity completed.

3. **Guideline Currency:** Pay attention to updated guidelines (blood pressure targets, lipid management, diabetes) as these change frequently and are heavily tested.

4. **Test Psychology:** The exam tests not just knowledge but clinical reasoning. "Next best step" questions require understanding of urgency and risk stratification.

5. **Error Analysis:** Maintain a detailed error log categorizing mistakes by knowledge deficit vs. test-taking error. Address systematic issues.

6. **Timing Optimization:** Most residents perform best taking the exam within 3-6 months of residency completion while knowledge is fresh.

7. **MOC Planning:** Consider subspecialty fellowship training when planning MOC timelines. Multiple certifications require coordination.

8. **Academic Integration:** Board preparation should reinforce clinical learning, not replace it. Patient care remains the ultimate teacher.

9. **Recertification Strategy:** For those in subspecialty practice, focus MOC activities on areas relevant to current practice while maintaining general medicine knowledge.

10. **Professional Development:** View certification not as an endpoint but as part of continuous professional development and commitment to excellence in patient care.`,
