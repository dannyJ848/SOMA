      explanation: `## What Is Board Recertification?

Board recertification is a way doctors show they are still good at their job even after many years of practice. It is like getting your driver\'s license renewed, but for doctors.

## Why Do Doctors Need to Recertify?

Medicine changes all the time. New:
- Medicines are invented
- Treatments are discovered
- Tests are developed
- Guidelines are updated

Doctors must keep learning to give patients the best care.

## What Do Doctors Have to Do?

To stay certified, doctors typically:
1. Take classes to learn new things (CME)
2. Pass tests to show they still know their specialty
3. Show they are improving their practice
4. Keep their medical license active

## How Often?

Different specialties have different rules:
- Most require testing every 8-10 years
- Some require activities every year or two
- It depends on the medical specialty

## What If They Don\'t Recertify?

Doctors can choose not to recertify, but:
- Hospitals may not let them work there
- Insurance companies may not include them
- Patients may prefer certified doctors
- It can affect their career

## Benefits of Recertification

- Keeps knowledge current
- Shows commitment to quality
- Builds patient trust
- Helps career advancement
- Professional pride`,

      clinicalNotes: `Expert perspective on MOC and recertification:

1. **Strategic Engagement:** Treat MOC as professional development, not just compliance. Choose activities that improve your practice, not just check boxes.

2. **Assessment Selection:** Evaluate continuous assessment options carefully. They reduce high-stakes stress but require ongoing attention.

3. **QI Meaningfulness:** Select QI projects that address real practice problems. Meaningful improvement benefits patients and satisfies requirements.

4. **Documentation Discipline:** Keep meticulous records of all MOC activities. Documentation requests often come unexpectedly.

5. **Cost Planning:** Budget for MOC expenses annually. Include fees, CME, examination costs, and time away from practice.

6. **Integration Opportunities:** Look for activities that satisfy multiple requirements - hospital credentialing, state CME, and MOC simultaneously.

7. **Reform Participation:** Engage in MOC reform through professional organizations. Your input shapes the future of certification.

8. **Evidence Acknowledgment:** Be honest about limited evidence linking MOC to outcomes. The value lies in professional standards and development, not proven outcome improvement.

9. **Career Stage Adaptation:** Adjust MOC engagement to career stage. Early career focuses on knowledge; late career on updating and legacy.

10. **Professional Identity:** MOC is part of professional commitment to excellence. Approach it as a privilege and responsibility, not a burden.`,
