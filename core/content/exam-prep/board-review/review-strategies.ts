      explanation: `## What Are Review Strategies?

Review strategies are smart ways to study for big tests like medical board exams. Instead of just reading books over and over, you use methods that help your brain learn and remember better.

## Why Do You Need Good Strategies?

**There is too much to learn:**
- Medical school teaches thousands of facts
- You cannot learn everything at once
- Good strategies help you focus on what matters

**Smart studying beats hard studying:**
- Quality matters more than hours
- The right methods save time
- You remember things longer

## Basic Review Strategies

**1. Make a Study Plan:**
- Decide what to study each day
- Set realistic goals
- Track your progress

**2. Use Practice Questions:**
- Answer questions after studying
- Learn from your mistakes
- Get used to test format

**3. Take Breaks:**
- Your brain needs rest
- Short breaks help you focus
- Do not study all day without stopping

**4. Review What You Forget:**
- Focus extra time on hard topics
- Come back to things you missed
- Do not just study easy stuff

## Good Study Habits

**Daily Habits:**
- Study at the same time each day
- Find a quiet place
- Turn off your phone
- Take short breaks

**Weekly Habits:**
- Review what you learned that week
- Identify what you still do not understand
- Adjust your plan if needed

## Common Mistakes

- Waiting until the last minute
- Only re-reading without testing yourself
- Studying too many hours without breaks
- Ignoring topics you find difficult
- Not using practice questions

## Tips for Success

1. Start studying early
2. Make a schedule and stick to it
3. Test yourself often
4. Get enough sleep
5. Ask for help when you need it`,

      clinicalNotes: `Expert perspective on board review strategies:

1. **Evidence Over Tradition:** Many traditional study methods are ineffective. Expert preparation relies on cognitive science evidence, not habit or preference.

2. **Active Over Passive:** The fundamental principle is engagement. Passive review feels productive but produces poor retention.

3. **Testing as Learning:** Practice questions are not just assessment - they are the most effective learning activity available.

4. **Spacing and Interleaving:** These principles are underutilized. Most learners mass practice and block content despite clear evidence against it.

5. **Metacognitive Development:** Expert learners know what they know and what they do not. This calibration skill is learnable and essential.

6. **Sustainable Practice:** Burnout undermines preparation. Expert preparation balances intensity with recovery.

7. **Individualization:** No single strategy works for everyone. Expert preparation adapts evidence-based principles to individual needs.

8. **Resource Efficiency:** Time is limited. Expert learners maximize learning per hour through strategic resource use.

9. **Performance Psychology:** Mental preparation matters. Anxiety management and confidence building are part of expert preparation.

10. **Continuous Improvement:** Expert preparation involves ongoing refinement based on performance data and reflection.`,
