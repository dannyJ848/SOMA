        "title": "Understanding Different Genetic Testing Categories",
        "content": "Genetic testing encompasses multiple categories including carrier screening (identifying individuals who carry gene changes for recessive conditions), prenatal testing (evaluating fetal health), diagnostic testing (confirming suspected conditions), predictive testing (assessing future disease risk), and pharmacogenomic testing (guiding medication selection and dosing). Each type serves distinct clinical purposes and has specific considerations for timing, interpretation, and follow-up."

        "title": "Clinical Applications of Genetic Testing Modalities",
        "content": "The clinical application of genetic testing requires understanding test characteristics including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and analytical versus clinical validity. Test selection depends on clinical indication, family history, and patient preferences. Pre-test probability, informed consent, and result interpretation frameworks differ by testing category. Laboratory methodologies range from targeted variant analysis to comprehensive genome sequencing."

        "title": "Advanced Genetic Testing Strategies and Interpretation",
        "content": "Contemporary genetic testing employs diverse methodologies including single-gene testing, multi-gene panels, chromosomal microarray, exome sequencing, and genome sequencing. Test selection algorithms consider diagnostic yield, cost-effectiveness, incidental finding policies, and turnaround time. Variant interpretation follows ACMG/AMP guidelines with ongoing reassessment as evidence accumulates. Clinical integration requires understanding of penetrance, expressivity, and genotype-phenotype correlations."
