        "title": "Interpreting Genetic Test Results",
        "content": "Genetic test results are classified based on whether variants (changes in DNA) are detected and their clinical significance. Results may be positive (a disease-causing variant found), negative (no variant found), or uncertain (a variant is found but its significance is unknown). Understanding these classifications helps you work with your healthcare team to make informed decisions about your care and family testing."

        "content": "Genetic variant interpretation follows ACMG/AMP guidelines that classify variants into five categories: pathogenic, likely pathogenic, variant of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign, and benign. This classification integrates population frequency data, computational predictions, functional evidence, and clinical observations. The clinical interpretation connects variant classification to patient phenotype and family history to determine actionability."

Variant curation applies evidence-based criteria including population data from gnomAD, computational predictions (REVEL, CADD), functional studies, and segregation analysis. Report review should address testing limitations, residual risk for negative results, and implications for cascade testing."
