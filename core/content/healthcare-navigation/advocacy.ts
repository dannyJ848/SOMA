- **Systematic reviews**: Comprehensive review of all evidence on a question

**Evidence Strength:**
- Large, well-designed studies provide stronger evidence
- Consistent findings across studies increase confidence
- Patient populations similar to you matter
- Outcomes that matter to patients vs surrogate markers

**Questions About Evidence:**
- "What is the strength of evidence for this recommendation?"
- "Are there randomized trials comparing these options?"
- "What are the number needed to treat and number needed to harm?"
- "What outcomes were measured in the studies?"

### Evidence-Based Medicine Framework

**Study Design Hierarchy:**
1. Systematic reviews of RCTs
2. Single RCTs with narrow confidence intervals
3. Well-designed cohort studies
4. Case-control studies
5. Case series
6. Expert opinion (without explicit critical appraisal)

**Understanding Statistics:**

**Diagnostic Tests:**
- Sensitivity: True positive rate (rules out disease with negative result)
- Specificity: True negative rate (rules in disease with positive result)
- Positive predictive value: Probability of disease with positive test (depends on prevalence)
- Negative predictive value: Probability of no disease with negative test (depends on prevalence)
- Likelihood ratios: How much test changes probability

**Treatment Effects:**
- Relative risk: Ratio of event rates
- Absolute risk: Difference in event rates
- Relative risk reduction: Proportional reduction
- Absolute risk reduction: Actual difference
- Number needed to treat (NNT)
- Number needed to harm (NNH)

**Understanding Guidelines:**
- Grading systems (GRADE, USPSTF)
- Level of evidence: A (high) to D (very low)
- Strength of recommendation: for, against, weak, strong
- Individualization required
- Patient values and preferences incorporated

### Quality Measurement Science

**Risk Perception:**

- Confirmation bias: Seeking confirming information
- Understanding these biases improves decision-making

**Value Clarification:**
- What outcomes matter most?
- How do you value quality vs quantity of life?

### Bioethics and Advocacy

**Principles of Bioethics:**
1. **Autonomy**: Patient's right to self-determination
2. **Beneficence**: Acting in patient's best interest
3. **Non-maleficence**: Do no harm
4. **Justice**: Fair distribution of resources

**Informed Consent Elements:**
- Diagnosis
- Proposed treatment
- Risks and benefits
- Alternatives (including doing nothing)
- Consequences of refusal
- Opportunity to ask questions
- Assessment of understanding

**Capacity Assessment:**
- Ability to understand information
- Ability to appreciate consequences
- Ability to reason through options
- Ability to communicate choice
- Specific to decision
- May fluctuate

**Medical Futility:**
- Conflict between patient wishes and medical judgment
- Physiologic futility: treatment won't achieve physiologic goal
- Qualitative futility: quality of life considerations
- Process-based: ethics committee consultation
- Legal precedents vary

### Health Policy and Advocacy

**Advocacy Beyond Individual:**
- Support patient advocacy organizations
- Participate in research advisory boards
- Participate in guideline development (patient representatives)
- Advocate for policy changes
- Share your story (when appropriate)

**Understanding Systems Issues:**
- Prior authorization requirements
- Step therapy protocols
- Formulary restrictions
- Network limitations
- Prior approval processes

**Systems-Level Advocacy:**
- Appeal denials
- Contact elected representatives
- Participate in quality improvement
- Join patient advisory councils
- Provide feedback to healthcare organizations

### Special Populations

**Vulnerable Populations:**
- Elderly: Potential for exploitation, cognitive issues
- Children: Dependence on others for care
- People with disabilities: Accessibility, accommodation
- Non-English speakers: Language access, cultural competence
- Undocumented: Fear of seeking care
- LGBT+: Historical discrimination, unique health needs
- People with mental illness: Stigma, autonomy concerns
- People with substance use disorders: Stigma, pain management challenges

**Advocating for Vulnerable Populations:**
- Recognize additional barriers
- Request accommodations
- Request appropriate interpreters
- Recognize vulnerability to exploitation
- Be aware of power dynamics
- Consider guardianship issues

### Research Literacy

**Evaluating Research:**
- Study design appropriate to question
- Sample size and power
- Confounding and bias
- Generalizability to you
- Funding source
- Publication bias (positive results more likely published)
- Conflict of interest
- Replication

**Understanding Uncertainty:**
- Medicine is not black and white
- Most decisions involve some uncertainty
- Probabilities, not certainties
- Individual variation
- Evolving evidence

**Participating in Research:**
- Understanding research vs clinical care
- Right to withdraw without penalty
- Access to results
- Compensation for injury
- IRB oversight
- Informed consent specific to research

### Advanced Care Planning

**Serious Illness Conversations:**
- Early in disease course
- Repeated over time
- Focus on values, not specific treatments
- Understand prognosis
- Identify fears and goals
- Discuss hopes

**Goals of Care:**
- What are you hoping for?
- What are you most afraid of?
- What makes life worth living?
- What outcomes would be unacceptable?
- What trade-offs are you willing to make?

**Medical Orders:**
- DNR/DNI orders
- Scope of treatment (full, limited, comfort-focused)
- Specific interventions (antibiotics, transfusion, dialysis)
- Documented orders, not just wishes

### Professional Boundaries

**Maintaining Relationships:**
- Assertiveness vs aggression
- Respecting provider expertise
- Recognizing mutual goals
- Using de-escalation techniques
- Knowing when to request different provider

**Appropriate Assertion:**
- Clear communication of needs
- Respectful tone
- Specific requests
- Explanation of reasoning
- Recognition of provider constraints

**Red Flags for Provider Change:**
- Refusal to answer questions
- Dismissiveness of concerns
- Unwillingness to consider alternatives
- Violation of professional boundaries
- Incompetence or negligence
- Cultural or linguistic incompetence

### Ethics of Healthcare Consumption

**Resource Considerations:**
- Understanding limited resources
- Value-based care (benefit vs cost)
- Avoiding low-value care
- Understanding opportunity costs
- Balancing individual and societal benefits

**Overuse and Overtreatment:**
- More care is not always better
- Testing harms: radiation, false positives, incidental findings
- Treatment harms: side effects, complications, burden
- Financial harms: cost, time away from work/family

**Choosing Wisely:**
- Question tests and procedures
- Understand when tests are necessary
- Discuss benefits and harms
- Avoid duplication
- Consider natural history`,

      clinicalNotes: `Patient advocacy at the professional level:
1. Recognize that activated patients have better outcomes
2. Create partnership relationships with patients
3. Use teach-back to confirm understanding
4. Discuss uncertainty openly
5. Engage in shared decision-making, especially for preference-sensitive decisions
6. Respect patient autonomy even when disagreeing with choices
7. Provide decision aids for preference-sensitive decisions
8. Address social determinants of health
9. Practice cultural humility
10. Recognize and address implicit bias

As clinicians, we support patient advocacy by providing information, respecting autonomy, and partnering in care decisions.`,
