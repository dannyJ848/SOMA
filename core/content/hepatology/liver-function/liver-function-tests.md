# Liver Function Tests Explained

## Overview
Liver function tests (LFTs), also called a liver panel or hepatic function panel, are blood tests that help evaluate how well your liver is working. These tests measure enzymes, proteins, and substances produced or processed by the liver. Understanding your LFT results helps you have informed conversations with your healthcare provider about your liver health and guides treatment decisions.

## Understanding Your Liver Panel

### Level 1: Foundation
A liver panel typically includes several tests that look at different aspects of liver health:

**Tests that show liver cell damage:**
- ALT (alanine aminotransferase)
- AST (aspartate aminotransferase)

**Tests that show bile duct function:**
- ALP (alkaline phosphatase)
- GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase)
- Bilirubin

**Tests that show liver function:**
- Albumin
- Total protein
- PT/INR (clotting time)

**Key point**: "Liver function tests" is somewhat misleading - most tests actually detect liver damage rather than function.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Normal Ranges (may vary by laboratory):**

| Test | Normal Range | What It Measures |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| ALT | 7-56 U/L | Liver cell damage |
| AST | 10-40 U/L | Liver (and other organ) damage |
| ALP | 44-147 U/L | Bile duct/bone issues |
| GGT | 9-48 U/L | Bile duct issues, alcohol use |
| Total bilirubin | 0.1-1.2 mg/dL | Bilirubin processing |
| Direct bilirubin | 0-0.3 mg/dL | Conjugated bilirubin |
| Albumin | 3.5-5.0 g/dL | Liver synthetic function |
| Total protein | 6.0-8.3 g/dL | Overall protein status |
| PT/INR | 11-13.5 sec / 0.8-1.1 | Clotting factor production |

**Patterns help identify the problem:**
- High ALT/AST: Liver cell injury
- High ALP/GGT: Bile duct problem
- Low albumin/prolonged PT: Poor liver function

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**The ALT/AST Ratio:**

| Ratio | Suggests |
|-------|----------|
| AST/ALT < 1 | Viral hepatitis, NAFLD |
| AST/ALT > 2 | Alcoholic liver disease |
| AST/ALT = 1-2 | Cirrhosis (any cause) |

**Elevation Patterns:**

**Hepatocellular pattern (liver cell damage):**
- ALT and AST elevated
- ALP normal or mildly elevated
- Causes: Viral hepatitis, NAFLD, drug toxicity, autoimmune hepatitis

**Cholestatic pattern (bile duct obstruction):**
- ALP elevated disproportionately
- GGT elevated
- ALT/AST mildly elevated
- Causes: Gallstones, tumors, primary biliary cholangitis

**Infiltrative pattern:**
- ALP elevated
- ALT/AST normal or mildly elevated
- Causes: Metastatic cancer, granulomatous disease

**Magnitude of Elevation:**

| Level | ALT/AST | Possible Causes |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Mild | 1-3x normal | NAFLD, chronic hepatitis, medications |
| Moderate | 3-10x normal | Acute hepatitis, autoimmune, alcohol |
| Severe | >10x normal | Acute viral hepatitis, ischemic injury, drug toxicity |
| Massive | >1000 U/L | Acetaminophen toxicity, ischemic hepatitis, acute viral |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Why Enzymes Leak:**

ALT and AST are normally inside liver cells. They appear in blood when:
- Liver cells are damaged or dying
- Cell membranes become leaky
- More severe injury = higher levels

**ALT vs. AST specificity:**
- ALT is more specific to liver (found mainly in liver)
- AST is found in liver, heart, muscle, kidney, brain
- Isolated AST elevation may indicate non-liver source

**Bilirubin Processing:**

| Type | Also Called | Indicates |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Unconjugated | Indirect | Hemolysis, Gilbert syndrome |
| Conjugated | Direct | Liver disease, bile duct obstruction |
| Total | Both combined | Overall bilirubin status |

**Interpreting elevated bilirubin:**
- Direct >50% of total: Hepatic or post-hepatic cause
- Indirect predominant: Pre-hepatic cause (hemolysis) or Gilbert syndrome
- Isolated mild indirect: Often benign Gilbert syndrome (affects 5% of population)

**Albumin and Synthetic Function:**
- Albumin half-life = 21 days
- Low albumin reflects chronic liver dysfunction (not acute)
- Also low in malnutrition, nephrotic syndrome, inflammation

**PT/INR and Clotting:**
- Clotting factors have shorter half-lives (hours to days)
- PT/INR reflects acute liver function better than albumin
- Prolonged PT may respond to vitamin K (if cholestasis) or indicates severe dysfunction

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Child-Pugh Score (Cirrhosis Staging):**

Uses bilirubin, albumin, PT/INR, ascites, and encephalopathy to classify cirrhosis severity:
- Class A (5-6 points): Compensated
- Class B (7-9 points): Significant dysfunction
- Class C (10-15 points): Decompensated

**MELD Score:**
- Uses bilirubin, INR, creatinine
- Predicts 3-month mortality
- Used for transplant listing priority
- Range: 6-40 (higher = sicker)

**Advanced Fibrosis Tests:**

Non-invasive fibrosis markers:
| Test | Components | Use |
|------|------------|-----|
| FIB-4 | Age, AST, ALT, platelets | Fibrosis screening |
| APRI | AST, platelets | Hepatitis C fibrosis |
| ELF | Hyaluronic acid, TIMP-1, PIIINP | Advanced fibrosis |

**FIB-4 Interpretation:**
- <1.3: Low probability of advanced fibrosis
- 1.3-2.67: Indeterminate (needs further testing)
- >2.67: High probability of advanced fibrosis

**Limitations of Routine LFTs:**

Normal LFTs do NOT rule out:
- Compensated cirrhosis
- Early fibrosis
- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
- Hepatic congestion

Abnormal LFTs do NOT always indicate liver disease:
- Muscle injury elevates AST
- Bone disease elevates ALP
- Hemolysis elevates bilirubin
- Many medications affect results

## Common Reasons for Abnormal LFTs

### Level 1: Foundation
**Common causes of elevated liver enzymes:**
- Fatty liver disease (very common)
- Medications (including over-the-counter)
- Alcohol use
- Viral hepatitis
- Obesity
- Herbal supplements

**What to do if your LFTs are abnormal:**
- Don't panic - many causes are treatable
- Follow up with your doctor
- Review all medications and supplements
- Be honest about alcohol intake
- Additional testing may be needed

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Medication-related elevations:**

Common culprits:
- Statins (cholesterol medications)
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen)
- Acetaminophen
- Antibiotics
- Herbal supplements
- Antifungals

**Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) patterns:**
- Hepatocellular: NSAIDs, isoniazid, statins
- Cholestatic: Amoxicillin-clavulanate, estrogens
- Mixed: Phenytoin, sulfonamides

**Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD):**
- Most common cause of mildly elevated ALT in developed countries
- Associated with obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome
- ALT typically 1-3 times normal
- May have normal LFTs despite fatty infiltration

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Workup of Elevated LFTs:**

**Initial evaluation:**
1. Repeat test to confirm (lab error possible)
2. Review medications, supplements, alcohol
3. Check viral hepatitis serologies (hepatitis B, C)
4. Screen for autoimmune markers if indicated
5. Abdominal ultrasound

**Specific tests based on suspicion:**

| Suspected Cause | Additional Tests |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Hepatitis B | HBsAg, HBcAb, HBsAb |
| Hepatitis C | HCV antibody, HCV RNA |
| Autoimmune hepatitis | ANA, ASMA, IgG |
| Wilson disease | Ceruloplasmin, 24-hr urine copper |
| Hemochromatosis | Iron studies, ferritin, genetic testing |
| PBC | AMA, IgM |
| Alpha-1 antitrypsin | Alpha-1 antitrypsin level |

**When to refer to hepatologist:**
- Persistent elevation despite addressing obvious causes
- ALT > 2x normal for > 6 months
- Signs of advanced liver disease
- Suspected autoimmune, metabolic, or rare liver disease
- Need for liver biopsy

## Monitoring and Follow-up

### Level 1: Foundation
**How often to check LFTs:**
- Depends on the underlying condition
- More frequent monitoring for active disease
- Less frequent when stable
- Your doctor will recommend appropriate intervals

**Lifestyle changes that can improve LFTs:**
- Lose weight if overweight
- Reduce alcohol consumption
- Exercise regularly
- Stop offending medications/supplements
- Eat a balanced diet

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Monitoring Schedules:**

| Condition | Typical Monitoring |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Fatty liver disease | Every 6-12 months |
| Chronic hepatitis B | Every 3-6 months |
| Chronic hepatitis C | Per treatment protocol |
| On hepatotoxic medications | Per prescriber recommendation |
| Cirrhosis | Every 3-6 months |

**Targets for improvement:**
- Normalization is ideal but not always possible
- Stable values are reassuring
- Trending improvement suggests healing
- Rising values need investigation

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Prognostic Implications:**

LFT trends indicate:
- Improving: Healing, effective treatment
- Stable: Chronic disease, adequate control
- Worsening: Disease progression, new insult
- Fluctuating: Variable compliance, ongoing injury

**Red flags requiring urgent evaluation:**
- ALT/AST > 1000 (acute liver injury)
- Rising bilirubin with worsening mental status
- PT/INR prolongation not correcting with vitamin K
- Rapidly falling albumin
- Development of ascites

---

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **"LFTs" mostly measure damage, not function** - albumin and PT/INR are true function tests
2. **AST/ALT ratio > 2 suggests alcoholic liver disease** - useful clinical clue
3. **Normal LFTs don't exclude liver disease** - cirrhosis can have normal enzymes
4. **Always check medications and supplements** - common cause of elevations
5. **Pattern of elevation guides diagnosis** - hepatocellular vs. cholestatic patterns

---

## Summary

Liver function tests are blood tests that measure enzymes released from damaged liver cells (ALT, AST), markers of bile duct function (ALP, GGT, bilirubin), and true liver function markers (albumin, PT/INR). Understanding the patterns of elevation helps identify the type of liver problem - hepatocellular injury shows elevated ALT/AST while cholestatic problems show elevated ALP. The AST/ALT ratio can suggest specific etiologies. Normal LFTs do not exclude liver disease, and abnormal values require systematic evaluation including medication review, viral hepatitis testing, and often imaging. Regular monitoring tracks disease progression or improvement.
