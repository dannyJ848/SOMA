# CT Scan (Computed Tomography)

## Overview
CT (Computed Tomography) uses X-rays and computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional images of the body. Unlike plain X-rays that show a flat image, CT creates "slices" through the body that can be viewed individually or combined into 3D reconstructions. CT provides excellent detail of bones, blood vessels, and soft tissues.

## How CT Works

### Level 1: Foundation
A CT scan is like taking many X-ray pictures from different angles while you lie inside a large donut-shaped machine. A computer combines these pictures to create detailed images showing the inside of your body.

**Simple analogy**: Imagine slicing a loaf of bread - each slice shows what's inside at that level. CT creates similar "slices" of your body without cutting.

**Key points**:
- You lie on a table that slides through the scanner
- The machine rotates around you taking pictures
- Completely painless
- Takes 5-30 minutes depending on the type
- May require contrast dye for some scans

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**How the Technology Works**:
1. X-ray tube rotates around patient (360 degrees)
2. Detectors on opposite side measure X-rays passing through
3. Computer calculates tissue density at each point
4. Creates images in "slices" (axial/cross-sectional)
5. Software can reconstruct other planes and 3D images

**Hounsfield Units (HU)**: Measurement of tissue density
| Tissue | HU Range |
|--------|----------|
| Air | -1000 |
| Fat | -100 to -50 |
| Water | 0 |
| Soft tissue | 20-70 |
| Blood (acute) | 50-100 |
| Bone | 400-1000 |
| Metal | 1000+ |

**Types of CT Studies**:
- **Non-contrast**: No dye, good for bleeding, stones, bones
- **With contrast**: IV dye highlights blood vessels and organs
- **CT Angiography (CTA)**: Focused on blood vessels
- **Multiphase**: Multiple scans at different times after contrast

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**CT Phases and Timing**:

| Phase | Timing Post-Injection | Best For |
|-------|----------------------|----------|
| Non-contrast | Before contrast | Bleeding, stones, calcifications |
| Arterial | 20-35 seconds | Arteries, hypervascular tumors |
| Portal venous | 60-80 seconds | Liver lesions, routine abdomen |
| Delayed | 3-5 minutes | Kidneys, ureters, bladder |
| Delayed (urography) | 10+ minutes | Collecting system |

**Image Windows**:
Different "window" settings display different tissues:
- **Bone window**: Wide window, shows bones clearly
- **Soft tissue/abdominal window**: Standard tissues
- **Lung window**: Shows lung detail, air vs. tissue
- **Brain window**: Optimized for gray/white matter

**Common CT Protocols**:
- **Head CT**: Brain, orbits, sinuses, temporal bones
- **CT Chest**: Lungs, mediastinum, vessels
- **CT Abdomen/Pelvis**: Organs, bowel, vessels, bones

## IV Contrast (Dye)

### Level 1: Foundation
Contrast is a special dye given through an IV (into a vein) that helps certain structures show up better on the CT scan. It makes blood vessels, organs, and abnormal areas easier to see.

**What to expect**:
- Small needle placed in arm vein
- Warm, flushed feeling when injected (normal)
- Metallic taste in mouth briefly
- Feeling like you need to urinate (normal)
- Effects pass within minutes

**Important**: Tell your doctor if you have:
- Kidney problems
- Previous contrast reactions
- Allergies
- Diabetes

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Types of CT Contrast**:

**Iodinated Contrast (IV)**:
- Most common for CT
- High-osmolar (HOCM): Older, more reactions
- Low-osmolar (LOCM): Standard of care
- Iso-osmolar (IOCM): Lowest reaction risk

**Oral Contrast**:
- Barium or water-soluble (Gastrografin)
- Opacifies the GI tract
- Helps distinguish bowel from other structures
- Positive (white) or neutral (water/low-density)

**Rectal Contrast**:
- For colorectal studies
- Usually water-soluble for safety

**When Contrast is Used**:
- Blood vessel evaluation
- Tumor detection and characterization
- Infection/abscess evaluation
- Kidney and urinary tract
- NOT needed for: Kidney stones, lung nodule follow-up, bones

### Level 3: Clinical Application

- Consider alternative imaging if possible

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Contrast-Induced Nephropathy (CIN)**:

**Definition**: Rise in creatinine >0.5 mg/dL or >25% from baseline within 48-72 hours

**Risk Factors**:
- Pre-existing kidney disease (GFR <60)
- Diabetes with nephropathy
- Dehydration
- Heart failure
- Multiple contrast doses
- Nephrotoxic medications

**Prevention Strategies**:
1. Check kidney function (eGFR) before contrast
2. IV hydration before and after
3. Hold metformin for 48 hours after (if eGFR <30)
4. Use lowest contrast volume needed
5. Avoid NSAIDs and other nephrotoxins
6. Space multiple contrast studies

**Metformin Considerations**:
- Concern: Lactic acidosis if acute kidney injury develops
- Current guidelines:
  - eGFR >30: Can continue metformin
  - eGFR <30: Hold for 48 hours, recheck creatinine

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Contrast Extravasation**:

**Presentation**: Pain, swelling at injection site

**Management**:
- Small volume (<10 mL): Ice, elevation, observation

## Radiation Considerations

### Level 1: Foundation
CT scans use more radiation than regular X-rays because they create detailed images from many angles. However, the radiation is still generally considered safe when the test is needed.

**Key points**:
- CT radiation is higher than plain X-rays
- Modern machines use dose-reduction technology
- Benefits usually outweigh risks when CT is appropriate
- Always tell staff if you might be pregnant

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Typical CT Radiation Doses**:

| CT Study | Dose (mSv) | Equivalent Chest X-rays |
|----------|------------|------------------------|
| Head | 2 | 20 |
| Chest (low-dose) | 1.5 | 15 |
| Chest (standard) | 7 | 70 |
| Abdomen/Pelvis | 10 | 100 |
| Cardiac | 3-12 | 30-120 |
| CTA Coronary | 1-15 | 10-150 |
| Annual background | 3 | 30 |

**Comparison**:
- Flying NYC to LA: 0.04 mSv
- Chest X-ray: 0.1 mSv
- CT Abdomen: 10 mSv
- Annual occupational limit: 50 mSv

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**When CT is Appropriate**:

**Strong Indications**:
- Suspected stroke (time-critical)
- Trauma evaluation
- Suspected pulmonary embolism
- Acute abdomen requiring diagnosis
- Cancer staging/surveillance
- Pre-surgical planning

**Consider Alternatives**:
- MRI for soft tissue detail (no radiation)
- Ultrasound for gallbladder, obstetric, pelvic
- X-ray if sufficient for diagnosis
- Clinical observation if low-risk presentation

**Inappropriate Use**:
- Routine screening in low-risk patients
- Repeat scanning when prior imaging sufficient
- When ultrasound or MRI would answer the question
- "Just to be sure" without clinical indication

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Dose Reduction Technologies**:

1. **Automatic Exposure Control (AEC)**:
   - Adjusts mA based on patient attenuation
   - Reduces dose in thinner regions
   - Maintains consistent image quality

2. **Tube Current Modulation**:
   - Angular modulation (shoulder vs. AP)
   - Z-axis modulation (chest vs. abdomen)

3. **Iterative Reconstruction**:
   - Reduces noise mathematically
   - Allows lower mA without losing quality
   - Standard on modern scanners

4. **Organ Dose Modulation**:
   - Reduces dose to anterior organs (breast, lens)
   - Automatic in many protocols

5. **Low-kV Imaging**:
   - 80-100 kV instead of 120 kV
   - Improves iodine contrast
   - Reduces dose in smaller patients

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Risk Communication and Shared Decision-Making**:

**Lifetime Attributable Cancer Risk**:
- 10 mSv (one CT abdomen) = approximately 1 in 2,000 additional cancer risk
- Age-dependent: Higher risk in children
- Sex-dependent: Females slightly higher risk
- Most cancers from medical radiation are never attributable

**Cumulative Dose Tracking**:
- Important for frequent imaging patients
- No established threshold for concern
- Track for awareness, not to refuse necessary imaging
- Consider dose in choosing modality

**Alternatives to Consider**:

| Clinical Question | CT Alternative |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Appendicitis | Ultrasound (if thin, young, female) |
| Kidney stone | Ultrasound or low-dose CT |
| Follow-up lung nodule | Low-dose CT |
| Stroke | MRI if available and time permits |
| Liver lesion characterization | MRI |
| Pediatric abdomen | Ultrasound first |

## Understanding Your CT Report

### Level 1: Foundation

**Common Terms**:
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Enhancement | Area brightens with contrast (has blood supply) |
| Hypodense/Hyperdense | Darker/brighter than surrounding tissue |
| Mass | Abnormal growth or lump |
| Nodule | Small round abnormality |
| Effusion | Fluid collection |
| Lymphadenopathy | Enlarged lymph nodes |
| No acute findings | Nothing immediately dangerous |

### Level 2: Core Understanding

**Report Structure**:
1. **Header**: Patient info, study type, indication
2. **Technique**: How the scan was performed
3. **Comparison**: Prior imaging reviewed
4. **Findings**: Systematic organ-by-organ description
5. **Impression**: Summary of important findings

**Measurement Significance**:
- Nodules: Size determines follow-up
- Lymph nodes: >1 cm short axis is concerning
- Masses: Change over time is key
- Fluid: Amount can guide intervention

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Incidental Findings**:
CT often finds unexpected abnormalities:
- Lung nodules
- Liver or kidney cysts
- Adrenal nodules
- Thyroid nodules

Most are benign but may require follow-up imaging to confirm stability.

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Contrast not always needed**: Non-contrast CT is first-line for stone, bleeding, and some emergencies
2. **Phases matter**: Different timing shows different pathology
3. **Clinical context essential**: Same finding can mean different things
4. **Dose awareness**: Use lowest dose that answers the question
5. **Prior imaging**: Always compare with previous studies
6. **Communication**: Discuss allergies, kidney function, and pregnancy
7. **Appropriate use**: CT is powerful but not always the right choice
8. **Follow-up**: Know what incidental findings need tracking
