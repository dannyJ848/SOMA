        "Chiropractors are doctors who use their hands to adjust your spine and other joints, mainly to help with back pain, neck pain, and headaches.",
      explanation: `**What is chiropractic care?**
Chiropractic care is a type of treatment where a trained doctor called a chiropractor uses their hands to adjust your spine and joints. The main treatment is called a "spinal adjustment" or "manipulation."

**What happens during an adjustment?**
The chiropractor uses quick, controlled movements to move joints in your spine. You might hear a popping or cracking sound - this is just gas bubbles releasing from the joint, like cracking your knuckles.

**What can chiropractic help with?**
- Back pain (this has the most evidence)
- Neck pain
- Some types of headaches
- Joint problems

**Is it safe?**
For most people, chiropractic care is safe when done by a licensed chiropractor. Some people feel a little sore after treatment, like after exercise. Serious problems are very rare.

**What chiropractors do NOT treat:**
- Infections or diseases
- Cancer
- Diabetes
- Most internal organ problems

**Important to know:**
- Chiropractors go to school for many years
- They are licensed doctors (Doctor of Chiropractic or DC)
- Tell them about all your health problems
- If something does not feel right, speak up
- Chiropractic works best for certain types of muscle and joint problems`,

      summary:
        "Chiropractic care primarily involves spinal manipulation to treat musculoskeletal conditions, with best evidence supporting its use for acute and chronic low back pain, neck pain, and certain headache types.",
      explanation: `**Chiropractic Philosophy:**

*Traditional View:*
- Based on idea that spinal misalignments ("subluxations") cause health problems
- Adjustments restore proper alignment
- Originally claimed to treat many conditions
- This broader view is not supported by modern science

*Modern Evidence-Based View:*
- Focuses on musculoskeletal conditions
- Works through neurological and mechanical effects
- One treatment option among many for back and neck pain
- Should be part of overall treatment plan

**What Chiropractors Do:**

*Spinal Manipulation:*
- High-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA) thrust
- Creates joint cavitation (the "pop" sound)
- Aims to improve joint mobility
- Most common chiropractic technique

*Other Techniques:*
- Mobilization (gentler movements)
- Soft tissue therapy
- Exercise prescription
- Ergonomic advice

**Evidence by Condition:**

*Good Evidence:*
- Acute low back pain (similar to other treatments)
- Chronic low back pain (modest benefit)
- Neck pain (short-term improvement)
- Cervicogenic headaches (from neck problems)

*Limited Evidence:*
- Tension headaches
- Migraines
- Shoulder problems
- Hip and knee conditions

*No Evidence/Not Recommended:*
- Asthma
- Colic in infants
- Ear infections
- High blood pressure
- Non-musculoskeletal conditions

**Safety Information:**

*Common Side Effects:*
- Local soreness (30-50% of patients)
- Fatigue
- Headache
- Usually resolve in 24-48 hours

*Rare but Serious Risks:*
- Stroke after neck manipulation (very rare: 1 in 400,000 to millions)
- Disk herniation (rare)
- Cauda equina syndrome (extremely rare)

*Contraindications (Do Not Treat):*
- Bone cancer or infection
- Severe osteoporosis
- Inflammatory arthritis (active)
- Unstable spine
- Blood clotting disorders
- Taking blood thinners (neck manipulation)

**Choosing a Chiropractor:**

*Good Signs:*
- Licensed (DC degree)
- Takes health history
- Performs examination
- Explains diagnosis and treatment plan
- Refers out when appropriate
- Does not claim to cure diseases

*Warning Signs:*
- Claims to treat non-musculoskeletal conditions
- Requires long-term treatment contracts
- Recommends X-rays for everyone
- Discourages seeing medical doctors
- Makes unrealistic promises`,

      summary:
        "Chiropractic spinal manipulation produces effects through neurophysiological mechanisms including altered motor neuron excitability and pain modulation, with systematic reviews supporting efficacy for low back and neck pain comparable to other conservative treatments.",
      explanation: `**Mechanisms of Action:**

*Biomechanical Effects:*
- Increased joint range of motion
- Altered segmental motion
- Effects on paraspinal muscle activity
- Facet joint gapping

*Neurophysiological Effects:*
- Decreased motor neuron excitability
- Altered H-reflex amplitude
- Changes in cortical processing
- Modulation of pain pathways
- Muscle spindle and mechanoreceptor stimulation

*Pain Modulation:*
- Activation of descending inhibitory pathways
- Endogenous opioid release
- Altered inflammatory mediators
- Central sensitization effects

**Evidence Synthesis:**

*Low Back Pain (Cochrane Reviews):*
- Acute: Similar to other active treatments
- Chronic: Small to moderate benefit
- Comparable to exercise, physical therapy
- May reduce medication use

*Neck Pain:*
- Short-term improvement supported
- Long-term benefits less clear
- Manual therapy plus exercise superior to either alone
- Comparable to mobilization

*Headache:*
- Cervicogenic headache: Moderate evidence
- Tension-type headache: Limited evidence
- Migraine: Insufficient evidence for recommendation

**Comparative Effectiveness:**

*Spinal Manipulation vs. Other Treatments:*
- Similar to NSAIDs for acute low back pain
- Comparable to physical therapy
- Similar to exercise therapy
- No evidence of superiority over other active treatments

*Addition to Other Treatments:*
- May enhance outcomes when combined with exercise
- Multimodal care often recommended
- Stepped care approaches

**Safety Analysis:**

*Lumbar Manipulation:*
- Generally safe when appropriately indicated
- Cauda equina syndrome: extremely rare (<1:1,000,000)
- Disk herniation: case reports, unclear causation

*Cervical Manipulation:*
- Cervical artery dissection risk debated
- Estimates: 1:400,000 to 1:5,850,000 manipulations
- Some studies suggest similar risk to primary care visits
- May be confounded by patients presenting with dissection symptoms

*Risk Factors for Adverse Events:*
- Anticoagulation
- Connective tissue disorders
- Osteoporosis
- Vascular disease
- Prior adverse reaction

**Clinical Guidelines:**

*ACP Guidelines (Low Back Pain):*
- Spinal manipulation listed as first-line option
- Among several non-pharmacologic options
- For acute and chronic low back pain

*NICE Guidelines:*
- Manual therapy (including manipulation) as option
- Combined with exercise
- Not as standalone treatment

**Integration Considerations:**

*When to Consider Referral:*
- Acute or chronic low back pain
- Mechanical neck pain
- Patient preference for manual therapy
- Inadequate response to self-care

*When to Avoid:*
- Red flag conditions (cancer, infection, fracture)
- Inflammatory arthritis
- Neurological deficits
- Vascular risk factors (for cervical)

*Collaboration:*
- Communication between chiropractors and physicians
- Shared care models
- Appropriate referral patterns
- Recognition of scope limitations`,
