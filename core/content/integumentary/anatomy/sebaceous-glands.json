      "explanation": "Your skin has millions of tiny glands that make an oily substance called sebum. Think of sebum as nature's lotion! These glands are usually connected to hair follicles and release their oil through the hair opening.\n\nSebum has important jobs:\n- It keeps your skin soft and waterproof\n- It keeps your hair shiny and healthy\n- It helps protect your skin from germs\n\nYou have the most sebaceous glands on your face, scalp, and upper back. That's why these areas can get oily. During puberty, hormones tell these glands to make extra sebum, which is why teenagers often have oilier skin and sometimes get acne.\n\nThe glands make oil in a special way - the cells actually fill up with oil, then burst open to release it. New cells grow to replace them, so the glands are constantly making fresh oil.",

      "summary": "Sebaceous glands are holocrine exocrine glands that produce sebum, usually associated with hair follicles as part of the pilosebaceous unit, with high density on the face, scalp, and upper trunk.",
      "explanation": "**Structure**\nSebaceous glands are small, lobulated structures located in the dermis. Most are connected to hair follicles, emptying sebum into the follicular canal. Some exist independently (free sebaceous glands) on the lips, eyelids (meibomian glands), nipples, and genitalia.\n\nThe gland consists of:\n- Outer layer of undifferentiated basal cells (germinative layer)\n- Inner cells progressively accumulating lipid droplets\n- Central cells that rupture, releasing sebum (holocrine secretion)\n\n**Sebum Composition**\nSebum contains:\n- Triglycerides (40-60%)\n- Wax esters (20-25%)\n- Squalene (12-15%)\n- Free fatty acids (5-10%)\n- Cholesterol and cholesterol esters\n\n**Function**\n- Lubricates and waterproofs skin and hair\n- Provides antimicrobial protection (fatty acids inhibit bacterial growth)\n- Transports antioxidants (vitamin E) to skin surface\n- Helps maintain skin pH (acid mantle)\n\n**Regulation**\nSebum production is regulated primarily by androgens (testosterone, DHT). This explains increased sebum production during puberty and the development of acne. The glands are also influenced by retinoids, growth hormone, and thyroid hormones.",

      "explanation": "**Cellular Biology**\nSebaceous gland development begins in utero around 13-16 weeks gestation, arising from the follicular epithelium. Sebocyte differentiation involves:\n\n1. Basal cells (stem cells) at periphery expressing K5, K14\n2. Proliferation and movement inward\n3. PPAR-γ activation initiates lipogenesis\n4. Progressive lipid accumulation (visible as vacuoles)\n5. Loss of nucleus and organelles\n6. Cell rupture and sebum release (transit time: 2-3 weeks)\n\n**Sebum Biochemistry**\nSebocytes synthesize lipids de novo:\n- Wax esters: Unique to sebum, formed from long-chain alcohols and fatty acids\n- Squalene: Triterpene synthesized via MVA pathway\n- Triglycerides: Partially hydrolyzed by bacterial lipases in follicle\n- Free fatty acids: Particularly sapienic acid (C16:1Δ6), antimicrobial\n\nSebum lipids are atypical: odd-chain, branched-chain, and unsaturated forms uncommon elsewhere.\n\n**Hormonal Regulation**\nAndrogens are the primary regulators:\n- Testosterone converted to DHT by 5α-reductase types 1 and 2\n- Androgens bind AR, increase proliferation and lipogenesis\n- IGF-1 acts synergistically\n- Estrogens: Inhibitory at high doses, complex effects\n- Retinoids: Decrease sebocyte proliferation and differentiation\n\n**Regional Variations**\n- Face/scalp: 400-900 glands/cm², high sebum production\n- Trunk: Intermediate density\n- Palms/soles: No sebaceous glands (no hair follicles)\n- Modified glands: Meibomian (eyelid), Fordyce spots (oral mucosa), Tyson glands (genitalia)\n\n**Microbiome Interaction**\nCutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes) colonizes the pilosebaceous unit, hydrolyzing triglycerides and metabolizing sebum. Dysbiosis contributes to acne pathogenesis.",

Evidence suggests bidirectional flow with bulge stem cells contributing to sebaceous gland regeneration. Blimp1+ progenitors and Lrig1+ cells contribute to sebocyte lineage.\n\n**Lipogenic Pathways**\nSebocyte lipogenesis involves multiple pathways:\n- SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) activation\n- Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FAS)\n- Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) for unsaturated fatty acids\n- DGAT enzymes for triglyceride synthesis\n\nmTORC1 signaling integrates hormonal and nutritional signals. High glycemic diet activates mTORC1/SREBP-1, increasing sebum production - linking diet to acne.\n\n**Androgen Signaling Details**\n- Type 1 5α-reductase: Predominant in sebaceous glands\n- Androgen receptor: Nuclear translocation, target gene transcription\n- Sebocyte-specific AR targets: Genes for lipid synthesis and differentiation\n- Anti-androgens (spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide) reduce sebum\n\n**Innate Immunity**\nSebocytes are immunologically active:\n- TLR2/6 expression, activated by C. acnes lipoproteins\n- Produce cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8)\n- Secrete antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidins, β-defensins)\n- Express inflammasome components\n\n**Pathophysiology of Acne**\n1. Androgen-induced sebum hypersecretion\n2. Follicular hyperkeratinization (microcomedone formation)\n3. C. acnes proliferation and biofilm formation\n4. Inflammation (innate and adaptive immunity)\n\nGenetic factors: AR gene CAG repeats, CYP17 polymorphisms, IL-1α variants\n\n**Sebaceous Neoplasms**\n- Sebaceous adenoma: Benign, Muir-Torre marker\n- Sebaceous carcinoma: Aggressive, periocular predilection, high mortality\n- Molecular: Loss of mismatch repair (MSI), adipophilin expression for diagnosis",
