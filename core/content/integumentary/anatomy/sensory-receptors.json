      "explanation": "Your skin is like a giant sensory blanket covering your whole body! It contains millions of tiny sensors (receptors) that send messages to your brain about what's touching you.\n\nDifferent sensors feel different things:\n- **Touch sensors** tell you when something lightly touches your skin\n- **Pressure sensors** tell you when something pushes hard on you\n- **Temperature sensors** let you know if something is hot or cold\n- **Pain sensors** warn you when something might hurt you\n\nSome parts of your body have more sensors than others. Your fingertips, lips, and tongue have tons of sensors - that's why you can feel tiny details with your fingers and why a small cut on your lip hurts so much! Your back has fewer sensors, so it's less sensitive.\n\nWhen a sensor detects something, it sends an electrical message through nerves to your brain. Your brain figures out what's happening and tells you what you're feeling. This happens incredibly fast - in less than a second!",

      "explanation": "**Types of Cutaneous Receptors**\n\nThe skin contains several types of sensory receptors:\n\n**Mechanoreceptors** (respond to mechanical deformation):\n1. **Meissner corpuscles**: In dermal papillae (glabrous skin), detect light touch and texture. Rapidly adapting - good for detecting movement and flutter.\n\n2. **Merkel discs**: At base of epidermis, detect sustained pressure and texture details. Slowly adapting - provide continuous information.\n\n3. **Pacinian corpuscles**: Deep in dermis/hypodermis, detect vibration and deep pressure. Rapidly adapting - best for high-frequency vibration (200-300 Hz).\n\n4. **Ruffini endings**: In dermis, detect skin stretch. Slowly adapting - important for sensing finger position.\n\n**Thermoreceptors**:\n- **Cold receptors**: Respond to temperatures below skin temperature (~30°C)\n- **Warm receptors**: Respond to temperatures above skin temperature (~37°C)\n- Both are free nerve endings in the epidermis/dermis\n\n**Nociceptors** (pain receptors):\n- Free nerve endings that respond to tissue damage\n- Types: Mechanical (pressure), thermal (extreme temperature), chemical (inflammation)\n- C fibers (slow, burning pain) and Aδ fibers (fast, sharp pain)\n\n**Adaptation**\n- Rapidly adapting (RA): Respond to stimulus change, then stop (Meissner, Pacinian)\n- Slowly adapting (SA): Respond continuously while stimulus present (Merkel, Ruffini)",
