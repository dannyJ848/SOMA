      summary: 'LGBTQ+ people may face unique mental health challenges because of stress from discrimination, but with support and affirming care, they can thrive.',
      explanation: `Everyone can have mental health challenges. LGBTQ+ people sometimes face extra stress because of how others treat them. Understanding this helps us provide better support.

**What Does LGBTQ+ Mean?**

- **L** - Lesbian: Women who are attracted to women
- **G** - Gay: People attracted to the same gender
- **B** - Bisexual: People attracted to more than one gender
- **T** - Transgender: People whose gender is different from what was assigned at birth
- **Q** - Queer/Questioning: An umbrella term or people exploring their identity
- **+** - Includes many other identities

**Why LGBTQ+ Mental Health Matters:**

LGBTQ+ people may experience:
- Bullying or rejection
- Worry about being accepted
- Discrimination at school, work, or in healthcare
- Family conflict about identity

This extra stress can lead to:
- Feeling sad or anxious
- Low self-esteem
- Sometimes thinking about self-harm

**What Helps:**

- Accepting family and friends
- Supportive communities
- Doctors who understand and respect them
- Counselors who specialize in LGBTQ+ care

**Important Facts:**

- Being LGBTQ+ is not a mental illness
- The stress comes from how others treat LGBTQ+ people, not from being LGBTQ+
- With support, LGBTQ+ people can be just as healthy and happy as anyone

**How to Be Supportive:**

- Use names and pronouns people ask you to use
- Listen without judging
- Stand up against bullying
- Learn about LGBTQ+ experiences
- Find affirming healthcare providers

**Remember:** Everyone deserves to be accepted for who they are.`,
