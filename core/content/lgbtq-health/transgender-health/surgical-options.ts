      summary: 'Gender-affirming surgeries help transgender people\'s bodies match their gender identity. Not all transgender people want or need surgery.',
      explanation: `Gender-affirming surgeries are medical procedures that change the body to better match a person\'s gender identity. These surgeries are one part of gender-affirming care.

**Types of Surgeries:**

**Chest Surgery:**
- For transgender men: Removal of breast tissue to create a flat chest (top surgery)
- For transgender women: Breast implants to develop breasts
- Recovery usually takes several weeks

**Facial Surgery:**
- Changes to face shape, hairline, or jaw
- Makes face appear more masculine or feminine
- Multiple procedures may be done

**Genital Surgery (Bottom Surgery):**
- For transgender women: Creating a vagina (vaginoplasty)
- For transgender men: Creating a penis (phalloplasty or metoidioplasty)
- Major surgery requiring significant recovery time

**Other Procedures:**
- Voice surgery to change pitch (rarely done)
- Body contouring to reshape areas like hips or waist
- Hair transplantation

**Important Points:**
- Not all transgender people want surgery
- Surgery is a personal choice
- Some surgeries are permanent and irreversible
- Insurance sometimes covers these procedures
- Requires preparation and aftercare

**Who Can Have Surgery:**
- Adults who have been on hormones (usually 12+ months)
- People in good overall health
- Those who have mental health support
- Requirements vary by procedure and surgeon

**Recovery:**
- Time needed varies by procedure
- Follow-up care is important
- Some surgeries require multiple stages
- Emotional support helps during recovery

**Safety:**
- Performed by specialized surgeons
- Like any surgery, there are risks
- Most people are satisfied with results
- Complications can usually be treated

Remember: Being transgender does not require surgery. Each person makes their own decisions about what is right for them.`,

      summary: 'Gender-affirming surgeries include chest reconstruction, facial procedures, and genital reconstruction, each with specific indications, techniques, and recovery considerations.',
      explanation: `Gender-affirming surgeries represent medically necessary procedures for some transgender individuals experiencing gender dysphoria. These surgeries are part of a comprehensive approach to transgender healthcare.

**Chest and Breast Surgery:**

**Chest Masculinization (Top Surgery for Trans Men):**
- Double incision with nipple grafts: Most common, removes all breast tissue
- Periareolar technique: For smaller chests, less scarring
- Keyhole technique: Minimal scarring for very small chests
- Requires 4-6 weeks recovery
- Nipple sensation may be reduced

**Breast Augmentation (Trans Women):**
- Silicone or saline implants
- Typically requires 12+ months estrogen for tissue development
- Various incision and placement options
- Recovery 2-4 weeks

**Facial Procedures:**

**Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS):**
- Forehead contouring and brow lift
- Rhinoplasty (nose reshaping)
- Jaw and chin contouring
- Hairline advancement
- Tracheal shave (Adam\'s apple reduction)
- Multiple procedures often combined

**Facial Masculinization:**
- Less commonly sought
- Chin and jaw augmentation
- Rhinoplasty

**Genital Surgeries:**

**Vaginoplasty (MTF/Transfeminine):**
- Penile inversion technique: Most common
- Uses penile and scrotal tissue to create vagina and labia
- Requires hair removal pre-operatively
- Hospital stay 3-5 days
- Recovery 6-12 weeks
- Dilation required long-term

**Phalloplasty (FTM/Transmasculine):**
- Radial forearm free flap: Most common donor site
- Creates sensate, functional phallus
- Multiple stages required
- Hospital stay 5-7 days
- Recovery several months
- Urethral lengthening allows standing urination

**Metoidioplasty (FTM/Transmasculine):**
- Releases testosterone-enlarged clitoris
- Less complex than phalloplasty
- Shorter recovery (4-6 weeks)
- Sensation preserved
- Smaller phallus, limited penetration capability

**Other Procedures:**

**Body Contouring:**
- Liposuction or fat grafting
- Gluteal augmentation
- Creates more feminine or masculine body shape

**Voice Surgery:**
- Cricothyroid approximation (feminization)
- Rarely performed due to variable outcomes
- Voice therapy usually preferred

**Eligibility Criteria:**
- Persistent gender dysphoria
- 12+ months hormone therapy (for most procedures)
- Mental health evaluation letters (WPATH guidelines)
- Medical clearance for surgery
- Realistic expectations

**Risks and Complications:**
