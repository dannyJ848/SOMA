Birth control pills are medicines that women take every day to prevent pregnancy. They are one of
the most common and effective forms of birth control. When taken correctly, they are about 99%
effective at preventing pregnancy. In real life, with occasional missed pills, they are about 91%
effective.

**What Birth Control Pills Are For**
- Preventing pregnancy.
- Regulating your menstrual cycle (making periods more regular).
- Reducing period cramps and pain.
- Treating acne.
- Reducing heavy menstrual bleeding.
- Managing conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and endometriosis.

**How Birth Control Pills Work**
There are two main types of birth control pills:
1. **Combination pills**: Contain two hormones — estrogen and progestin. Most women take this type.
2. **Progestin-only pills (mini-pills)**: Contain only progestin. Better for women who cannot take
   estrogen (such as those who are breastfeeding or have certain health conditions).

These hormones prevent pregnancy in three ways:
- They stop your ovaries from releasing an egg each month (ovulation).
- They thicken the mucus at the opening of your cervix, making it harder for sperm to get through.
- They thin the lining of your uterus, making it harder for a fertilized egg to attach.

**How to Take Birth Control Pills**
- Take one pill every day at the same time.
- Most packs have 21 active pills and 7 inactive (placebo) pills, or 24 active and 4 inactive.
  You get your period during the inactive pill days.
- Some packs have 28 pills; others have 21. If you have a 21-pill pack, wait 7 days before
  starting the next pack.
- If you miss a pill, take it as soon as you remember. If you miss two or more, use a backup
  method (like condoms) for at least 7 days.
- Start your first pack as directed by your doctor. Some women start on the first day of their
  period; others start on a Sunday.

**Common Side Effects**
- Nausea — taking the pill with food or at bedtime can help.
- Breast tenderness or swelling.
- Headaches.
- Spotting or bleeding between periods (especially in the first few months).
- Mood changes.
- Bloating or weight changes.
Most side effects get better within the first 2-3 months. If they do not, talk to your doctor
about trying a different pill.

**Important Warnings**
- Birth control pills do NOT protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Use condoms
  for STI protection.
- Tell your doctor if you smoke, especially if you are over 35. Smoking while taking the pill
  greatly increases your risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke.
- Seek emergency medical help if you have: sudden severe headache, chest pain, leg pain or
  swelling, sudden vision changes, or severe abdominal pain. These could be signs of a blood clot.
- Some medicines can make the pill less effective, including some antibiotics, seizure medicines,
  and the herbal supplement St. John's Wort. Tell your doctor about everything you take.

**When to Call Your Doctor**
- Side effects that do not improve after 3 months.
- Severe headaches or migraines, especially with aura (visual disturbances).
- Chest pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath.
- Signs of depression or significant mood changes.
- You missed several pills and had unprotected sex.

**Tips for Success**
- Set a daily alarm on your phone to remember your pill.
- Keep an extra pack in your purse in case you forget to take one at home.
- If you vomit within 2 hours of taking the pill, take another one.
- If you want to stop the pill, talk to your doctor first about what to expect.

      title: 'Understanding Oral Contraceptives for Reproductive Health',
      titleEs: 'Entendiendo los Anticonceptivos Orales para la Salud Reproductiva',
      content: `
Oral contraceptives (OCs) are among the most widely studied and used medications in the world. Since
their introduction in 1960, they have been refined to minimize side effects while maintaining
excellent efficacy. Understanding the types, mechanisms, and health considerations of OCs empowers
women to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.

**Types of Oral Contraceptives**
1. **Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs)**: Contain both ethinyl estradiol (EE) or estetrol (E4)
   and a progestin. Available in monophasic (same dose throughout), biphasic, or triphasic
   (varying doses) formulations.
   - Low-dose: 20-35 mcg ethinyl estradiol.
   - Ultra-low-dose: 10-20 mcg ethinyl estradiol.
   - Extended-cycle: 84 active pills with 7 inactive (Seasonique) — only 4 periods per year.
   - Continuous use: Skip all placebo pills for no periods (medically safe).
2. **Progestin-Only Pills (POPs/Mini-Pills)**: Contain only a progestin (norethindrone 0.35 mg
   or drospirenone 4 mg). No estrogen-related risks. Must be taken within the same 3-hour window
   daily (norethindrone) or 24-hour window (drospirenone/Slynd).

**How COCs Prevent Pregnancy**
The primary mechanism is suppression of ovulation through inhibition of the hypothalamic-pituitary-
ovarian (HPO) axis:
- **Estrogen** suppresses follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), preventing follicular development.
- **Progestin** suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, preventing ovulation.
- Secondary mechanisms: cervical mucus thickening and endometrial atrophy.

**Choosing the Right Pill**
Different progestins have different properties, which can help match the pill to the patient:
- **Drospirenone (Yaz, Yasmin)**: Anti-androgenic and anti-mineralocorticoid. Good for acne,
  PCOS, bloating, and PMS/PMDD. Small risk of hyperkalemia.
- **Norgestimate (Ortho Tri-Cyclen)**: Low androgenicity. FDA-approved for acne treatment.
- **Levonorgestrel (Alesse, Aviane)**: Well-studied, reliable. Higher androgenicity — may worsen
  acne in some women.
- **Desogestrel (Desogen, Apri)**: Moderate anti-androgenic activity.

**Managing Missed Pills**
The CDC and WHO provide specific guidance based on how many pills are missed:
- **1 missed pill**: Take it as soon as you remember, even if that means two pills in one day.
  No backup method needed.
- **2 missed pills in week 1 or 2**: Take the most recent missed pill, discard the other. Use
  backup contraception for 7 days. Consider emergency contraception if unprotected sex occurred.
- **2 missed pills in week 3**: Finish active pills in the pack, skip the placebo pills, and
  start a new pack immediately. Use backup for 7 days.
- **3 or more missed pills**: Take the most recent pill, skip the rest. Use backup for 7 days.
  Consider emergency contraception.

**Health Benefits Beyond Contraception**
OCs have several established non-contraceptive benefits:
- 50% reduction in ovarian cancer risk (protective effect lasts up to 30 years after stopping).
- 50% reduction in endometrial cancer risk.
- Reduced risk of colorectal cancer.
- Treatment of dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and menstrual migraines.
- Improvement of acne and hirsutism.
- Management of endometriosis symptoms.
- Treatment of PMDD (drospirenone-containing pills are FDA-approved for this).

**Health Risks and Contraindications**
The primary serious risk of COCs is venous thromboembolism (VTE):
- Baseline VTE risk in reproductive-age women: 1-5 per 10,000 women-years.
- VTE risk on COCs: 3-9 per 10,000 women-years (higher with newer progestins).
- VTE risk in pregnancy: 5-20 per 10,000 women-years (higher than any OC).
- Risk factors that amplify VTE risk: smoking over 35, obesity (BMI >30), Factor V Leiden or
  other thrombophilias, history of VTE, prolonged immobilization.

**Absolute contraindications to COCs (CDC Medical Eligibility Criteria Category 4)**:
- Smokers over 35 (15+ cigarettes/day).
- History of VTE or known thrombophilia.
- Migraine with aura at any age.
- Current breast cancer.
- Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic >=160 or diastolic >=100).
- History of ischemic heart disease or stroke.
- Major surgery with prolonged immobilization.

      content: `
Oral contraceptives represent one of the most extensively studied drug classes in pharmacology.
Decades of epidemiological data, randomized trials, and pharmacokinetic studies have refined our
understanding of their mechanisms, metabolic effects, and risk-benefit profiles across diverse
patient populations.

**Pharmacology of Estrogen Components**
The estrogen component in COCs serves to suppress FSH-driven folliculogenesis and stabilize the
endometrium (preventing breakthrough bleeding):
- **Ethinyl estradiol (EE)**: The dominant synthetic estrogen since the 1960s. Potency exceeds
  endogenous estradiol due to resistance to first-pass hepatic metabolism (the C17-alpha-ethinyl
  group protects against deactivation). Hepatic effects include increased synthesis of clotting
  factors (II, VII, X, fibrinogen), SHBG, TBG, and angiotensinogen.
- **Estradiol valerate (E2V)**: A prodrug of natural estradiol used in Natazia (quadriphasic
  regimen with dienogest). More physiologic hepatic profile with potentially reduced VTE risk.
- **Estetrol (E4)**: A naturally occurring fetal estrogen used in Nextstellis (with drospirenone).
  Selective estrogen action — activates nuclear ER-alpha while antagonizing membrane ER-alpha,
  potentially reducing hepatic clotting factor induction and VTE risk.

**Pharmacology of Progestin Components**
Progestins vary significantly in their receptor-binding profiles, affecting androgenic, anti-
androgenic, anti-mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid activity:
- **First generation** (norethindrone, norethindrone acetate): Moderate androgenicity, some estrogenic
  activity (norethindrone is partially aromatized to EE).
- **Second generation** (levonorgestrel, norgestrel): Potent progestational and androgenic activity.
  Lowest VTE risk among COC progestins.
- **Third generation** (desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate): Reduced androgenicity but potentially
  higher VTE risk compared to second-generation progestins.
- **Fourth generation** (drospirenone, dienogest, nomegestrol acetate): Drospirenone is a
  spironolactone analog with anti-androgenic and anti-mineralocorticoid activity. Dienogest has
  potent anti-androgenic activity and is used for endometriosis (Visanne).

**Pharmacokinetics**
- EE undergoes significant first-pass metabolism (oral bioavailability approximately 40-50%) via
  CYP3A4 and sulfation/glucuronidation. Enterohepatic recirculation contributes to sustained
  levels; antibiotics that disrupt gut flora (historically rifampin, definitively) may reduce
  recirculation.
- Most progestins are well-absorbed with bioavailability ranging from 60-100%. Protein binding
  varies: levonorgestrel binds SHBG; desogestrel and drospirenone bind primarily to albumin.
- Drug interactions: CYP3A4 inducers (rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wort,
  certain antiretrovirals) significantly reduce EE and progestin levels. CYP3A4 inhibitors
  may increase levels. Rifampin is the only antibiotic with definitive evidence of reducing OC
  efficacy — routine antibiotics (amoxicillin, azithromycin) do not require backup contraception.

**Thrombotic Risk: Mechanism and Epidemiology**
The estrogen-mediated increase in hepatic clotting factor synthesis is the primary mechanism of
VTE risk:
- EE increases factors II, VII, X, and fibrinogen while decreasing antithrombin III, protein S,
  and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI).
- VTE risk is highest in the first year of use (especially first 3 months) and returns to baseline
  within 3 months of discontinuation.
- Third-generation progestins (desogestrel, gestodene) and drospirenone carry approximately 1.5-2x
  the VTE risk of levonorgestrel-containing COCs. The mechanism may involve differential effects on
  activated protein C (APC) resistance.
- The overall absolute risk increase is small: approximately 2-4 additional VTE events per 10,000
  women-years of use. This is substantially lower than the VTE risk of pregnancy.

**Non-Contraceptive Applications: Evidence Base**
- **Ovarian cancer protection**: 40-50% risk reduction with 5+ years of use. Mechanism: ovulation
  suppression reduces ovarian surface epithelial trauma and exposure to follicular fluid cytokines.
  Protective effect demonstrated even in BRCA1/2 carriers.
- **Endometrial cancer protection**: 50% reduction with 4+ years of use, lasting 15+ years after
  discontinuation.
- **Endometriosis**: Continuous COC use suppresses ectopic endometrial tissue growth.
  Dienogest-containing regimens have the strongest evidence base.
- **PCOS management**: COCs address hyperandrogenism (via SHBG increase and anti-androgenic
  progestins), regulate cycles, and protect the endometrium from unopposed estrogen.

      titleEs: 'Terapeutica Avanzada de Anticonceptivos Orales: Toma de Decisiones Clinicas',
      content: `
Advanced oral contraceptive prescribing requires nuanced risk-benefit assessment, application of
the CDC US Medical Eligibility Criteria (US-MEC), management of complex medical comorbidities,
and individualized selection based on patient-specific factors and non-contraceptive goals.

**Risk Stratification Using the US-MEC**
The US-MEC classifies contraceptive methods into four categories for each medical condition:
- **Category 1**: No restriction. Use freely.
- **Category 2**: Advantages generally outweigh risks. Can use, but closer follow-up may be needed.
- **Category 3**: Risks generally outweigh advantages. Usually not recommended unless no better
  alternative exists.
- **Category 4**: Unacceptable health risk. Do not use.

Key Category 4 conditions for COCs (absolute contraindications):
- Age >=35 and smoking >=15 cigarettes/day.
- Multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
- Hypertension (systolic >=160 or diastolic >=100).
- VTE history or known thrombogenic mutations.
- Ischemic heart disease or stroke history.
- Valvular heart disease with complications.
- Migraine with aura at any age.
- Current breast cancer.
- Diabetes with vascular complications.
- Cirrhosis with decompensation.
- Hepatocellular adenoma or malignant hepatoma.

**COC Selection for Complex Patients**
*Obesity (BMI >=30):*
COCs remain effective in obese women, though some pharmacokinetic data suggest slightly lower
EE levels due to increased volume of distribution. The US-MEC classifies obesity as Category 2.
Consider progestin-only methods or LARCs for women with additional VTE risk factors. Drospirenone-
containing pills may offer metabolic advantages (anti-mineralocorticoid effects) but carry
slightly higher VTE risk.

*Migraine management:*
- Migraine without aura: COCs are Category 2. Can be used with monitoring. Some women experience
  improvement in menstrual migraines with extended-cycle or continuous regimens.
- Migraine with aura: COCs are Category 4 (absolute contraindication) due to 2-4 fold increased
  ischemic stroke risk when combined with estrogen.
- All migraine patients on COCs should be counseled to report any aura symptoms immediately.

*Breastfeeding:*
- COCs within the first 30 days postpartum: Category 4 (high VTE risk, potential lactation effects).
- COCs 30 days to 42 days postpartum: Category 3.
- COCs after 42 days postpartum: Category 2.
- Progestin-only pills: Category 1 at any time postpartum. No effect on milk supply.

*Hypertension:*
- Adequately controlled hypertension: Category 3.
- Systolic 140-159 or diastolic 90-99: Category 3.
- Systolic >=160 or diastolic >=100: Category 4.
- Progestin-only pills are Category 1-2 for most hypertensive patients.

**Thrombophilia Screening**
Routine thrombophilia screening before COC initiation is NOT recommended by ACOG or WHO:
- Factor V Leiden prevalence is 3-8% in Caucasians, but the absolute VTE risk increase for
  carriers on COCs remains relatively low (approximately 30 per 10,000 women-years).
- Screening would generate excessive false positives, unnecessary test anxiety, and cost.
- Screen ONLY if: personal history of VTE, first-degree relative with VTE before age 50, or
  known family thrombophilia.

**Drug Interactions: Clinical Management**
- **CYP3A4 inducers** (rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, topiramate at doses
  >200 mg, certain antiretrovirals): COCs should not be relied upon. Recommend IUD, injection,
  or implant.
- **Lamotrigine**: Complex bidirectional interaction. EE increases lamotrigine glucuronidation,
  reducing levels by up to 50%. During the pill-free interval, lamotrigine levels rebound,
  risking toxicity. Continuous COC use with stable lamotrigine dosing is preferred if COCs are
  used. Non-hormonal methods are often preferred.
- **Warfarin**: COCs may increase or decrease warfarin sensitivity. Monitor INR closely during
  initiation and discontinuation.
- **Thyroid hormone**: COCs increase TBG, raising total T4. Free T4 and TSH are unaffected.
  Levothyroxine dose adjustment is generally not needed, but monitor TSH.

**Discontinuation and Return to Fertility**
- Fertility returns rapidly after COC discontinuation, typically within 1-3 months. There is no
  benefit to a "washout" period before attempting conception.
- Post-pill amenorrhea lasting >3 months warrants evaluation for underlying causes (not caused
  by the pill itself).
- No evidence of teratogenicity from inadvertent use during early pregnancy.

This expert-level review examines the molecular pharmacology, thrombotic pathophysiology,
pharmacogenomic considerations, and emerging therapeutic frontiers in oral contraception.

**Estrogen Receptor Pharmacology in Contraception**
The differential effects of synthetic estrogens on hepatic hemostatic parameters are mediated
through estrogen receptor subtype activation:
1. **Nuclear ER-alpha activation**: EE potently activates nuclear ER-alpha in hepatocytes, driving
   transcription of clotting factors (II, VII, X, fibrinogen), SHBG, angiotensinogen, and CRP.
   This accounts for both the contraceptive efficacy (FSH suppression) and thrombotic risk.
2. **Membrane ER-alpha activation**: EE also activates membrane ER-alpha, triggering non-genomic
   signaling (PI3K/Akt, MAPK) that amplifies hepatic protein synthesis responses.
3. **Estetrol selective pharmacology**: E4 activates nuclear ER-alpha (mediating contraceptive
   efficacy) while antagonizing membrane ER-alpha (potentially attenuating the amplified hepatic
   response). Phase 3 data for E4/drospirenone (Nextstellis) show reduced impact on hemostatic
   parameters compared to EE-containing COCs, though head-to-head VTE outcome data are pending.
4. **Estradiol valerate**: As a prodrug of natural estradiol, E2V undergoes first-pass metabolism
   producing estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate. The quadriphasic regimen in Natazia maintains
   contraceptive efficacy while producing a more physiologic hormonal profile.

**Thrombotic Pathophysiology: Molecular Mechanisms**
The VTE risk of COCs involves complex interactions between estrogen-mediated hemostatic changes and
progestin-specific modulation:
- **Prothrombotic changes**: Increased synthesis of factors II, VII, VIII, X, and fibrinogen;
  increased von Willebrand factor; decreased antithrombin III, protein S, and TFPI.
- **APC resistance**: All COCs induce some degree of acquired APC resistance, measured as the
  ETP-based APC sensitivity ratio. This normalized APC sensitivity ratio (nAPCsr) is a validated
  biomarker for VTE risk. Third-generation progestins and drospirenone induce greater APC
  resistance than levonorgestrel, correlating with their higher VTE risk.
- **Platelet activation**: EE enhances platelet aggregation through thromboxane A2 pathway
  potentiation.
- **Fibrinolytic changes**: Increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), partially
  offsetting increased tPA — net effect may be slightly prothrombotic.
- **Genetic amplification**: Factor V Leiden (heterozygous) increases VTE risk 5-7x; combined
  with COC use, the risk is 30-50x baseline. Prothrombin G20210A mutation similarly amplifies risk.

**Pharmacogenomics of Oral Contraceptive Response**
Genetic variation influences both efficacy and adverse effects:
- **CYP3A4/CYP3A5 polymorphisms**: CYP3A4*22 (reduced function) may increase EE exposure, while
  CYP3A5*1 (functional allele, more prevalent in Black populations) may increase clearance. Clinical
  significance for contraceptive failure is uncertain but under investigation.
- **CYP2C19**: Affects metabolism of certain progestins. Poor metabolizers may have higher progestin
  levels and potentially more side effects.
- **UGT1A1**: Affects EE glucuronidation. UGT1A1*28 (Gilbert syndrome allele) reduces clearance,
  potentially increasing EE exposure.
- **ESR1 (ER-alpha)**: Polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor alpha gene may influence individual
  response to estrogen-containing OCs, including breakthrough bleeding and mood effects.
- **F5 (Factor V Leiden) and F2 (Prothrombin G20210A)**: The most clinically relevant
  pharmacogenomic variants for OC safety. Despite their importance, routine screening is not
  recommended due to low positive predictive value in the general population.

**Male Hormonal Contraception: Emerging Frontier**
The development of male hormonal contraception has been a decades-long challenge:
- **Mechanism**: Exogenous testosterone (with or without progestin) suppresses gonadotropins
  (FSH, LH) via HPG axis feedback, reducing spermatogenesis to azoospermia or severe
  oligozoospermia (<1 million sperm/mL).
- **Regimens in clinical trials**: Nestorone (segesterone acetate)/testosterone gel combination
  (NES/T) has completed Phase 2b trials with >94% suppression of spermatogenesis and acceptable
  side effects.
- **DMAU (dimethandrolone undecanoate)**: An oral androgen/progestin combination (single molecule)
  that demonstrated gonadotropin suppression in Phase 1 trials.
- **Barriers**: Reversibility concerns, regulatory caution, industry investment, and sociocultural
  factors have slowed development.

**Emerging Contraceptive Technologies**
- **Non-hormonal oral contraceptives**: Research into soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) inhibitors
  targeting sperm motility and oocyte-sperm interaction offers potential for hormone-free oral
  contraception.
- **On-demand contraception**: Ulipristal-based and other approaches providing post-coital
  contraceptive efficacy without daily dosing are under investigation.
- **Microbiome interactions**: Emerging evidence that the vaginal and gut microbiome may influence
  OC metabolism and side effects, opening possibilities for personalized contraceptive prescribing.
