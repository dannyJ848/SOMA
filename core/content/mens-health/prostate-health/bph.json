      "summary": "As men get older, the prostate often grows larger, which can make it harder to urinate.",
      "explanation": "BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) is a very common condition where the prostate grows bigger as men age. 'Benign' means it's not cancer. Because the prostate wraps around the tube that carries urine, when it gets bigger, it can squeeze this tube and make urinating more difficult. You might notice you need to go more often, especially at night, or that your stream is weaker. This happens to most men eventually - about half of men in their 50s and most men in their 80s have some degree of prostate enlargement. The good news is there are many effective treatments.",

      "summary": "BPH is a non-malignant proliferation of prostatic tissue in the transition zone, causing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) through bladder outlet obstruction.",
      "explanation": "BPH occurs in the transition zone of the prostate, the area surrounding the urethra. As this tissue enlarges, it compresses the prostatic urethra, creating bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). Symptoms are divided into: 1) Voiding (obstructive) symptoms: hesitancy, weak stream, straining, intermittency, incomplete emptying, terminal dribbling; 2) Storage (irritative) symptoms: frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge incontinence. The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) quantifies severity (0-7 mild, 8-19 moderate, 20-35 severe). Natural history is progressive but variable - some men have minimal bother while others develop complications (acute urinary retention, recurrent UTIs, bladder stones, renal insufficiency). BPH has both static (tissue volume) and dynamic (smooth muscle tone) components, which is why combination therapy works well.",

      "summary": "BPH pathophysiology involves androgen-dependent stromal-epithelial proliferation with a significant smooth muscle component, explaining the efficacy of combined pharmacotherapy targeting both static and dynamic obstruction.",
      "explanation": "BPH develops exclusively in the transition zone through both stromal and glandular hyperplasia. The pathophysiology involves: 1) Androgen-dependent growth: DHT (via 5-alpha reductase type 2) promotes epithelial and stromal proliferation; 2) Stromal-epithelial interactions: paracrine growth factors (FGF, EGF, TGF-beta) drive proliferation; 3) Smooth muscle tone: alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (particularly alpha-1A subtype) in prostatic smooth muscle contribute to dynamic obstruction. This dual pathophysiology underlies combination therapy: 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride) reduce glandular volume over 6-12 months, while alpha-blockers (tamsulosin, alfuzosin, silodosin) relax smooth muscle for rapid symptom relief. The COMBAT and MTOPS trials demonstrated superiority of combination therapy for larger prostates (>30-40g) with moderate-severe symptoms. Secondary bladder changes (detrusor hypertrophy, then decompensation) contribute to storage symptoms. The AUA Symptom Index (identical to IPSS) plus bother score guides treatment decisions.",

Minimally invasive surgical therapies (MISTs): UroLift (prostatic urethral lift - mechanical separation of lateral lobes, preserves ejaculation), Rezum (water vapor thermal therapy), Aquablation (robotic waterjet ablation), and iTind (temporary implant). Traditional surgeries: TURP (transurethral resection - gold standard, highest efficacy, 65% retrograde ejaculation), HoLEP (holmium laser enucleation - equivalent to open prostatectomy, size-independent), PVP (photoselective vaporization), simple prostatectomy (for very large glands >80-100g).

      "summary": "Contemporary BPH management integrates phenotyping based on prostatic anatomy, bladder function, and patient-centered outcomes with novel therapeutic targets and emerging technologies.",
      "explanation": "Advanced BPH management concepts: 1) Phenotyping matters: prostatic configuration (lateral lobe, median lobe, bilobar) guides procedural selection - median lobe responds poorly to UroLift but well to Rezum; intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) on ultrasound predicts symptom severity and treatment response. 2) Bladder dysfunction assessment: pressure-flow urodynamics differentiates BOO from detrusor underactivity (contractility index) - detrusor underactivity predicts poor response to prostate surgery; overactive bladder (OAB) component may persist after deobstruction requiring anticholinergics/beta-3 agonists. 3) PSA density and multiparametric MRI role: in men with elevated PSA and BPH, PSA density <0.15 and negative mpMRI (PI-RADS 1-2) may obviate biopsy; transition zone volume on MRI predicts 5-ARI response. 4) Emerging therapies: prostatic artery embolization (PAE) offers non-surgical debulking with 30-40% volume reduction; convective radiofrequency water vapor (Rezum) targeting median lobe; aquablation with robotically controlled waterjet and real-time ultrasound guidance; combinations of MISTs may evolve. 5) Sexual function preservation has become paramount - ejaculatory dysfunction significantly impacts quality of life; ejaculation-preserving procedures (UroLift, Rezum, Aquablation) are preferred in sexually active men.
