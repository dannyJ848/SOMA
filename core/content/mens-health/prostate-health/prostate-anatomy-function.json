      "summary": "The prostate is a small gland that helps make the fluid that carries sperm.",
      "explanation": "The prostate is about the size of a walnut and sits just below your bladder. It wraps around the tube (urethra) that carries urine from your bladder out through your penis. The prostate makes a special fluid that mixes with sperm to create semen. This fluid helps protect and feed the sperm so they can survive and reach an egg. All men have a prostate, and it typically stays the same size until around age 40-50, when it often starts to grow larger.",

      "summary": "The prostate is an accessory reproductive gland that produces prostatic fluid, a key component of semen that aids sperm survival and motility.",
      "explanation": "The prostate is located in the male pelvis, positioned inferior to the bladder, anterior to the rectum, and surrounding the prostatic urethra. In a young adult male, it weighs approximately 20 grams and measures about 4cm wide, 3cm tall, and 2cm deep. The prostate produces approximately 30% of seminal fluid volume. Prostatic fluid is slightly acidic (pH ~6.5) but helps neutralize vaginal acidity to protect sperm. Key components include: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) which liquefies semen after ejaculation, citric acid which provides energy for sperm, and zinc which has antimicrobial properties. The gland is divided into zones: the peripheral zone (where most cancers arise), the central zone (around the ejaculatory ducts), and the transition zone (where benign enlargement occurs).",

      "summary": "The prostate is a tubuloalveolar exocrine gland with zonal anatomy that determines disease predilection, androgen-dependent function, and complex secretory products essential for fertility.",
      "explanation": "The prostate's McNeal zonal anatomy has important clinical implications: the peripheral zone (70% of glandular tissue) is the site of 70% of carcinomas and is easily palpable on digital rectal exam (DRE). The central zone (25% of tissue) surrounds the ejaculatory ducts and is relatively resistant to disease. The transition zone (5% of tissue) is the exclusive site of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and accounts for 25% of cancers. The anterior fibromuscular stroma contains no glandular tissue. Histologically, the prostate contains tubuloalveolar glands with secretory columnar epithelium (expressing PSA, PAP), basal cells (p63+, lost in carcinoma), and rare neuroendocrine cells. The gland is surrounded by a true capsule (important for cancer staging) and a fascial sheath. Prostatic secretions include PSA (kallikrein family serine protease), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), zinc (highest concentration of any organ), citric acid, polyamines (spermine, spermidine), and prostaglandins.",

      "summary": "Prostate biology centers on androgen-dependent epithelial-stromal interactions governing development, homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis through testosterone/DHT-AR signaling pathways.",
      "explanation": "Prostatic development and maintenance depend on androgen signaling through the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Circulating testosterone enters prostate cells and is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by 5-alpha reductase type 2 (SRD5A2). DHT binds the androgen receptor (AR) with 10-fold higher affinity than testosterone. The liganded AR translocates to the nucleus, binding androgen response elements (AREs) to regulate gene transcription. Key AR-regulated genes include PSA (KLK3), TMPRSS2, and NKX3.1. Epithelial-stromal interactions are critical: AR signaling in stromal cells produces paracrine factors (FGFs, IGF-1) that support epithelial survival and secretory function. The prostate epithelium contains a hierarchy: basal cells (CD44+, p63+, AR-low) include stem cells; transit-amplifying cells differentiate into luminal cells (AR+, PSA+, differentiated secretory cells) and rare neuroendocrine cells (chromogranin A+, synaptophysin+). This understanding underlies BPH/cancer therapeutics targeting the androgen axis.",

      "explanation": "Advanced prostate pathobiology relevant to clinical practice: 1) Molecular alterations in prostate cancer include TMPRSS2-ERG fusion (50% of cases - androgen-regulated fusion creating ERG overexpression), PTEN loss (40% - PI3K/AKT pathway activation), TP53 mutations (progression marker), RB1 loss (neuroendocrine differentiation), DNA repair gene alterations (BRCA1/2, ATM, PALB2 - 20-25% of mCRPC, PARP inhibitor eligible), and AR amplification/mutations (castration resistance). 2) Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) mechanisms: intratumoral androgen synthesis, AR amplification, AR mutations (broadening ligand specificity), AR splice variants (AR-V7 constitutively active, lacks ligand-binding domain - predicts resistance to AR-targeted therapies), and glucocorticoid receptor takeover. 3) Novel targets: PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen) for imaging (PSMA PET-CT) and radioligand therapy (Lu-177 PSMA); neuroendocrine markers for treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer. 4) Germline genetics: BRCA2 carriers have 8-fold increased prostate cancer risk with more aggressive disease; cascade testing indicated for metastatic cases and strong family history.",
