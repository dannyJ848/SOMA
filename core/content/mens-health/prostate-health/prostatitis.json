      "summary": "Prostatitis is when the prostate becomes inflamed or infected, causing pain and urinary symptoms.",
      "explanation": "Prostatitis means the prostate is inflamed (swollen and irritated). Unlike an enlarged prostate (BPH), which mainly affects older men, prostatitis can happen at any age, including young men. It's actually one of the most common reasons men under 50 see a urologist. Symptoms can include pain in the pelvis, groin, or lower back, difficulty or pain when urinating, and sometimes fever if there's an infection. There are different types - some are caused by bacteria and need antibiotics, while others are not caused by infection and may need different treatments. The good news is that most cases improve with proper treatment, though some men have recurring episodes.",

      "summary": "Prostatitis encompasses four syndromes: acute bacterial (serious infection), chronic bacterial (recurring infections), chronic pelvic pain syndrome (most common), and asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis.",
      "explanation": "The NIH classification divides prostatitis into four categories: Category I (acute bacterial prostatitis) is a serious infection with fever, chills, and severe urinary symptoms - it requires immediate antibiotic treatment and may require hospitalization. Category II (chronic bacterial prostatitis) involves recurring urinary tract infections with bacteria found in the prostate - treated with longer courses of antibiotics (4-12 weeks). Category III (chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome or CP/CPPS) is the most common type (90-95% of cases) - it causes pelvic pain and urinary symptoms but NO bacteria are found; it may have inflammatory (IIIA) or non-inflammatory (IIIB) subtypes. Category IV (asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis) is found incidentally on biopsy or semen analysis.

      "summary": "Prostatitis pathophysiology varies by type: bacterial categories involve uropathogenic infection while CP/CPPS likely reflects a complex interplay of inflammation, pelvic floor dysfunction, and central sensitization.",
      "explanation": "Acute bacterial prostatitis (Category I) typically results from ascending urethral infection with gram-negative organisms (E. coli 80%, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus) or hematogenous spread. Risk factors include UTI, urethral instrumentation, and unprotected anal intercourse. The acutely infected prostate is boggy and exquisitely tender - vigorous massage is contraindicated (bacteremia risk). Chronic bacterial prostatitis (Category II) involves bacterial persistence in prostatic acini, often with biofilm formation; the same organisms predominate. The blood-prostate barrier limits antibiotic penetration, hence prolonged fluoroquinolone therapy (good prostatic penetration). CP/CPPS (Category III) pathophysiology is multifactorial: initial insult (infection, trauma, autoimmune) triggers prostatic inflammation, which sensitizes pelvic floor muscles and pudendal nerve, leading to chronic pelvic floor myofascial dysfunction and eventually central sensitization with hyperalgesia. This explains why antibiotics often fail - the chronic pain persists after any initiating infection resolves. The UPOINT phenotyping system (Urinary, Psychosocial, Organ-specific, Infection, Neurologic/systemic, Tenderness) guides individualized multimodal treatment.",

      "summary": "Advanced prostatitis management requires precise phenotyping, understanding of microbiome contributions, recognition of related pain syndromes, and multimodal therapy targeting central and peripheral mechanisms.",
      "explanation": "Acute bacterial prostatitis: Requires fluoroquinolone (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) or TMP-SMX for 4-6 weeks minimum; severe cases require hospitalization with IV antibiotics; prostatic abscess (2-3% of cases) requires drainage. Monitor for urinary retention requiring catheterization. Chronic bacterial prostatitis: Biofilm-forming pathogens (E. coli, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas) require prolonged fluoroquinolone therapy (6-12 weeks) with 60-80% cure rates; alpha-blocker adjunct improves outcomes. Consider prostatic calcifications as bacterial reservoirs. CP/CPPS: The most challenging category. Key insights: 1) Microbiome alterations may play a role - prostatic and urinary microbiome studies show altered communities; 2) It exists on a spectrum with interstitial cystitis, vulvodynia, and irritable bowel syndrome (chronic pelvic pain syndrome complex); 3) Pudendal neuralgia should be considered in perineal-predominant pain; 4) Myofascial trigger points in levator ani, obturator internus, and piriformis muscles contribute significantly. Treatment: multimodal per UPOINT. Physical therapy (reverse Kegels, trigger point release, myofascial techniques) has Level 1 evidence. Phytotherapy (quercetin, pollen extracts) shows modest benefit. Neuromodulators (amitriptyline, duloxetine) for central sensitization. Avoid repeated prostatic biopsies and TURP in CP/CPPS.",

      "explanation": "Emerging perspectives in prostatitis: 1) Microbiome: Next-generation sequencing reveals complex prostatic and urinary microbiomes even in 'sterile' CP/CPPS; dysbiosis may perpetuate inflammation; therapeutic implications include targeted probiotics and phage therapy for chronic bacterial prostatitis. 2) Immunology: CP/CPPS shows Th1/Th17 skewing, elevated IL-6 and TNF-alpha in prostatic fluid; autoimmune mechanisms suspected with antibodies against prostatic antigens. Novel anti-inflammatory targets include mast cell stabilizers and lipoxygenase inhibitors. 3) Neurogenic inflammation: Substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) contribute to prostatic inflammation and pain sensitization; potential targets for therapy. 4) Pelvic pain neuroscience: Functional MRI shows altered brain connectivity patterns in CP/CPPS, similar to other chronic pain syndromes; suggests CNS-targeted therapies (neuromodulation, mindfulness-based stress reduction) are appropriate. 5) Biomarkers: Urinary chemokines (MCP-1, MIP-1alpha) may differentiate inflammatory from non-inflammatory CPPS; semen cytokine profiles correlate with symptom severity. 6) Neuromodulation: Transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation, sacral neuromodulation (for refractory cases), and electroacupuncture show promise.
