      "summary": "PSA is a blood test that can help find prostate cancer, but it's not perfect and the decision to get tested should be made carefully.",
      "explanation": "PSA (prostate-specific antigen) is a protein made by your prostate. A simple blood test can measure how much PSA is in your blood. Higher levels can sometimes indicate prostate cancer, but here's the tricky part: PSA can also be high for other reasons (like an enlarged prostate or infection) and some men with prostate cancer have normal PSA levels. That's why doctors say the PSA test is 'controversial' - it can find cancers, but it can also lead to unnecessary worry and treatments. The decision to get a PSA test is personal and should involve a conversation with your doctor about your individual risk and preferences.",

      "summary": "PSA screening can detect prostate cancer early but also leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment; current guidelines recommend shared decision-making rather than routine screening.",
      "explanation": "PSA screening involves measuring serum PSA levels, with traditional cutoffs of >4.0 ng/mL triggering further evaluation. Benefits: PSA screening can detect prostate cancer at earlier, potentially more treatable stages and has contributed to declining prostate cancer mortality. Limitations: 1) Low specificity - most elevated PSAs are NOT cancer (BPH, prostatitis, recent ejaculation); 2) Overdiagnosis - finding slow-growing cancers that would never cause harm (up to 50% of screen-detected cancers); 3) Overtreatment - treatment of indolent cancers with side effects (incontinence, erectile dysfunction). The controversy: The USPSTF gave PSA screening a 'D' rating in 2012 (don't screen) but revised to 'C' for ages 55-69 in 2018, emphasizing informed decision-making. The AUA recommends shared decision-making starting at age 55 (or 40-45 for high-risk men). High-risk groups include African American men and those with family history of prostate cancer.",

      "summary": "PSA as a biomarker has inherent limitations addressed by risk calculators, PSA derivatives (density, velocity, free PSA), and mpMRI, shifting the paradigm from reflex biopsy toward risk-stratified pathways.",
      "explanation": "PSA biology: PSA is a kallikrein-family serine protease that liquefies semen. It's prostate-specific but not cancer-specific - any prostatic disruption elevates PSA. Limitations of PSA thresholds: At PSA >4.0 ng/mL, sensitivity for cancer is ~70-80% but specificity is only ~25-30%; the positive predictive value for any cancer is ~25% (1 in 4 with elevated PSA has cancer) and for clinically significant cancer (Grade Group ≥2) even lower. Refining PSA utility: 1) PSA density (PSA/prostate volume): >0.15 suggests cancer; 2) PSA velocity: increase >0.75 ng/mL/year is concerning; 3) Free/total PSA ratio: <10% suggests cancer, >25% suggests BPH; 4) PHI (prostate health index): combines total, free, and -2proPSA - improves specificity. Risk calculators (PCPTRC, ERSPC) incorporate PSA with age, DRE, family history, race. The MRI revolution: Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) before biopsy (PI-RADS scoring) detects clinically significant cancer with ~90% negative predictive value - negative MRI (PI-RADS 1-2) can avoid biopsy. PROMIS and PRECISION trials validated MRI-targeted biopsy. Current risk-stratified approach: elevated PSA → mpMRI → if positive (PI-RADS 3-5), MRI-targeted biopsy; if negative, close monitoring or avoid biopsy.",

      "clinicalNotes": "5-alpha reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride) reduce PSA by ~50% - double measured PSA in treated patients. Ejaculation within 24-48 hours can mildly elevate PSA. DRE causes minimal PSA elevation and can be done before blood draw."

      "summary": "Contemporary PSA interpretation integrates genomic biomarkers, advanced imaging with PSMA-PET, and risk-based screening protocols to maximize detection of clinically significant cancer while minimizing overdiagnosis.",
      "explanation": "Biomarker landscape beyond PSA: 1) Blood-based: PHI, 4Kscore (combines 4 kallikreins with clinical variables) - both predict clinically significant cancer and reduce unnecessary biopsies by 30-50%; 2) Urine-based: PCA3 (prostate cancer gene 3), SelectMDx, ExoDx (exosome-based) - obtained after DRE massage; 3) Tissue-based (for biopsy interpretation): Confirm MDx (epigenetic), Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score, Decipher - guide active surveillance vs. treatment decisions. Imaging advances: mpMRI (T2, DWI, DCE) with PI-RADS v2.1 scoring; PSMA PET-CT (68Ga-PSMA-11, 18F-DCFPyL) for staging with superior sensitivity for nodal and metastatic disease - increasingly used for initial staging of high-risk disease and biochemical recurrence. Screening guideline synthesis: AUA/SUO recommends shared decision-making starting at 55-69 (or 40-45 for high-risk); stop screening when life expectancy <10-15 years. NCCN includes early baseline at 45-75 with risk stratification. European guidelines emphasize MRI before biopsy. Screening paradigm evolution: Moving from 'treat all detected cancers' to 'risk-adapted management' - Grade Group 1 cancers increasingly managed with active surveillance. Numbers needed to screen (NNS) to prevent one prostate cancer death: ~1000 at 10 years, improving with risk-stratification and avoidance of overdiagnosis.",
