Understanding that mental health conditions are medical conditions helps reduce stigma.', explanation: '**What Is Stigma?**\n\nStigma is negative attitudes and discrimination toward people with mental health conditions. It causes real harm.\n\n**Types of Stigma:**\n\n*Public Stigma:*\n- Society\'s negative attitudes\n- Discrimination in jobs, housing\n- Media stereotypes\n- Fear and avoidance\n\n*Self-Stigma:*\n- Internalizing negative beliefs\n- Shame about having a condition\n- "I should be able to handle this"\n- Avoiding help\n\n**How Stigma Hurts:**\n- Delays help-seeking\n- Causes shame and isolation\n- Leads to discrimination\n- Worsens outcomes\n- Reduces self-esteem\n- Affects relationships\n\n**The Truth:**\n- Mental health conditions are medical conditions\n- They affect the brain, not character\n- They are common (1 in 5 adults)\n- They are treatable\n- Recovery is possible\n- People with mental illness contribute fully to society\n\n**Fighting Stigma:**\n\n*In Yourself:*\n- Educate yourself\n- Challenge your own assumptions\n- Use person-first language\n- Share your story if comfortable\n\n*In Society:*\n- Speak up against discrimination\n- Support mental health causes\n- Share accurate information\n- Treat people with dignity\n\nEvery conversation that normalizes mental health helps reduce stigma.', keyTerms: [{ term: 'stigma', definition: 'Negative attitudes and discrimination toward a group' }, { term: 'self-stigma', definition: 'Internalizing negative beliefs about oneself' }, { term: 'discrimination', definition: 'Unfair treatment based on characteristics like mental illness' }], analogies: ['Stigma is like a second illness on top of the first - and this one is preventable.'], examples: [] },
    2: { level: 2, summary: 'Stigma operates at public, structural, and self levels. It reduces help-seeking and worsens outcomes. Effective interventions include contact, education, and advocacy. Person-first language and accurate portrayals help reduce stigma.', explanation: '**Stigma Domains:**\n\n*Public Stigma:*\n- Stereotypes: Beliefs about mental illness (dangerous, incompetent)\n- Prejudice: Emotional reactions (fear, pity)\n- Discrimination: Behavior (avoidance, exclusion)\n\n*Structural Stigma:*\n- Policy discrimination\n- Institutional practices\n- Funding disparities\n- Insurance parity issues\n\n*Self-Stigma:*\n- Awareness of stereotypes\n- Agreement with stereotypes\n- Application to self\n- Harm to self-esteem\n\n**Impact:**\n\n*Help-Seeking:*\n- Delays treatment\n- Reduces adherence\n- Avoids disclosure\n\n*Life Domains:*\n- Employment discrimination\n- Housing barriers\n- Relationship impacts\n- Healthcare disparities\n\n**Evidence-Based Interventions:**\n\n*Contact:*\n- Interpersonal contact with people with mental illness\n- Most effective intervention\n- In-person best, video also works\n\n*Education:*\n- Accurate information\n- Challenging myths\n- Medical model framing\n\n*Advocacy:*\n- Policy change\n- Protest against discrimination\n- Structural change\n\n**Language Matters:**\n\n*Person-First:*\n- "Person with schizophrenia" not "schizophrenic"\n- Emphasizes person, not condition\n\n*Avoiding Stigmatizing Terms:*\n- "Died by suicide" not "committed suicide"\n- Avoid casual use of diagnosis terms', keyTerms: [{ term: 'public stigma', definition: 'Society\'s negative attitudes toward mental illness' }, { term: 'structural stigma', definition: 'Policies and practices that disadvantage people with mental illness' }, { term: 'person-first language', definition: 'Language that puts the person before their condition' }], analogies: [] },

Contact-based interventions have strongest evidence. Structural and self-stigma require different approaches.', explanation: '**Theoretical Models:**\n\n*Modified Labeling Theory:*\n- Societal beliefs about mental illness exist\n- Labeling activates beliefs\n- Expectations of rejection\n- Coping responses (secrecy, withdrawal)\n- Negative outcomes\n\n*Social Cognitive Model:*\n- Stereotypes (cognitive)\n- Prejudice (emotional)\n- Discrimination (behavioral)\n- Operates at individual and structural levels\n\n**Intervention Evidence:**\n\n*Contact:*\n- Meta-analyses support effectiveness\n- In-person > video > imagination\n- Key elements: Moderate disconfirmation, equal status, common goals\n- Target-specific (condition, population)\n\n*Education:*\n- Modest effects\n- Better for knowledge than attitudes\n- May backfire (emphasizing difference)\n\n*Protest:*\n- Suppresses stigma expression\n- May not change attitudes\n- Useful for structural change\n\n**Self-Stigma Interventions:**\n\n*Cognitive Approaches:*\n- Challenging internalized beliefs\n- Self-esteem work\n- CBT-based\n\n*Peer Support:*\n- Positive identity\n- Role models\n- Community\n\n*Narrative Approaches:*\n- Changing self-story\n- Recovery narratives\n- Meaning-making\n\n**Structural Stigma:**\n\n*Policy Focus:*\n- Parity legislation\n- Anti-discrimination laws\n- Funding equity\n- Practice change\n\n**Media:**\n- Guidelines for portrayal\n- Training journalists\n- Entertainment influence\n- Social media considerations', keyTerms: [{ term: 'modified labeling theory', definition: 'Theory explaining how societal labels affect people with mental illness' }, { term: 'contact-based intervention', definition: 'Stigma reduction through contact with people with mental illness' }, { term: 'stereotype threat', definition: 'Fear of confirming negative stereotypes affecting performance' }], clinicalNotes: 'Contact is most effective stigma intervention.
