    1: { level: 1, summary: 'Stress is your body\'s response to challenges. While some stress is normal, chronic stress affects mental and physical health. Effective management includes lifestyle changes, relaxation techniques, and sometimes professional help.', explanation: '**Understanding Stress**\n\nStress is how your body responds to demands and challenges. Some stress is normal and can even help you perform better. But too much stress for too long can harm your health.\n\n**Signs of Too Much Stress:**\n- Feeling overwhelmed or anxious\n- Trouble sleeping\n- Headaches or muscle tension\n- Irritability\n- Difficulty concentrating\n- Changes in appetite\n\n**Healthy Ways to Manage Stress:**\n\n**Physical:**\n- Regular exercise\n- Adequate sleep\n- Healthy eating\n- Limiting caffeine and alcohol\n\n**Mental:**\n- Deep breathing exercises\n- Mindfulness and meditation\n- Positive self-talk\n- Setting realistic expectations\n\n**Social:**\n- Talking to friends and family\n- Asking for help when needed\n- Setting boundaries\n- Making time for fun\n\n**Practical:**\n- Breaking tasks into smaller steps\n- Making to-do lists\n- Learning to say no\n- Managing time effectively\n\n**When to Get Help:**\nIf stress is overwhelming or affecting your daily life, talk to a healthcare provider.', keyTerms: [{ term: 'stress', definition: 'Your body\'s response to demands or challenges' }, { term: 'coping', definition: 'Ways of dealing with difficult situations' }], analogies: ['Stress is like a rubber band - some stretch helps, but too much causes it to snap.'], examples: ['Taking a 10-minute walk when feeling overwhelmed can help clear your mind and reduce stress hormones.'] },
    2: { level: 2, summary: 'Stress involves the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system activation. Chronic stress contributes to mental and physical health problems. Evidence-based management includes cognitive strategies, relaxation techniques, lifestyle modifications, and social support.', explanation: '**Stress Response:**\n\nWhen you perceive a threat, your body activates:\n- Sympathetic nervous system (fight-or-flight)\n- HPA axis (cortisol release)\n\nThis is adaptive for short-term challenges but harmful when chronic.\n\n**Effects of Chronic Stress:**\n- Mental: Anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment\n- Physical: Cardiovascular, immune, digestive effects\n- Behavioral: Sleep problems, substance use\n\n**Evidence-Based Strategies:**\n\n**Cognitive:**\n- Cognitive restructuring\n- Problem-solving training\n- Acceptance-based approaches\n\n**Relaxation:**\n- Progressive muscle relaxation\n- Diaphragmatic breathing\n- Mindfulness meditation\n- Guided imagery\n\n**Lifestyle:**\n- Aerobic exercise\n- Sleep hygiene\n- Nutrition\n- Time management\n\n**Social:**\n- Social support utilization\n- Communication skills\n- Boundary setting', keyTerms: [{ term: 'HPA axis', definition: 'Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis - stress hormone system' }, { term: 'progressive muscle relaxation', definition: 'Systematically tensing and releasing muscle groups' }], analogies: [] },

    4: { level: 4, summary: 'Stress pathophysiology involves glucocorticoid effects on neural plasticity, inflammatory pathways, and allostatic load. Interventions target multiple systems.
