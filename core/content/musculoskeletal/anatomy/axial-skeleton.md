# Axial Skeleton

## Overview
The axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body, consisting of 80 bones that provide support and protection for the brain, spinal cord, and thoracic organs. It includes the skull (22 bones), vertebral column (26 bones), and thoracic cage (25 bones including sternum and ribs).

## Skull

### Level 1: Foundation
The skull is the bony structure of the head, divided into two main parts:
- **Cranium**: Protects the brain (8 bones)
- **Facial bones**: Form the face (14 bones)

The skull has openings (foramina) for blood vessels and nerves.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Cranial Bones (8):**
- Frontal bone (1): Forms forehead
- Parietal bones (2): Form top and sides
- Temporal bones (2): Contain ear structures
- Occipital bone (1): Forms back of skull
- Sphenoid bone (1): "Keystone" of cranium
- Ethmoid bone (1): Part of nasal cavity roof

**Facial Bones (14):**
- Maxillae (2): Upper jaw
- Mandible (1): Lower jaw (only movable skull bone)
- Zygomatic bones (2): Cheekbones
- Nasal bones (2): Bridge of nose
- Lacrimal bones (2): Medial orbit wall
- Palatine bones (2): Hard palate and nasal cavity

## Thoracic Cage

### Level 1: Foundation
The thoracic cage (rib cage) protects the heart and lungs. It consists of:
- 12 pairs of ribs
- Sternum (breastbone)
- Thoracic vertebrae

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Ribs (12 pairs):**
- **True ribs (1-7)**: Attach directly to sternum via costal cartilage
- **False ribs (8-10)**: Attach to sternum indirectly via cartilage above
- **Floating ribs (11-12)**: No anterior attachment

**Rib Anatomy:**
- Head: Articulates with vertebral bodies
- Neck: Connects head to body
- Tubercle: Articulates with transverse process
- Body (shaft): Curved portion
- Costal groove: Inferior surface (VAN - vein, artery, nerve)

**Sternum:**
- Manubrium: Superior, articulates with clavicles
- Body: Middle portion
- Xiphoid process: Inferior, cartilaginous until ~40 years

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Sternal Landmarks:**
- Suprasternal (jugular) notch: T2 level
- Sternal angle (of Louis): T4-T5, 2nd rib attachment
- Xiphisternal junction: T9

**Clinical Significance of Sternal Angle:**
- Tracheal bifurcation
- Aortic arch begins/ends
- Superior mediastinum boundary
- Azygos vein enters SVC

**Intercostal Spaces:**
- Between adjacent ribs
- Contain intercostal muscles, vessels, nerves
- VAN arrangement (superior to inferior) in costal groove
- Thoracentesis/chest tube: Above rib to avoid NV bundle

**Rib Fractures:**
- Most common: Ribs 5-9
- First rib fracture: High-energy trauma, check for vascular injury
- Lower rib fractures: Check for liver/spleen injury
- Flail chest: ≥3 consecutive ribs fractured in ≥2 places

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Costovertebral Joints:**
1. **Head of rib with vertebral body:**
   - Typically articulates with 2 vertebrae and disc
   - Ribs 1, 10, 11, 12 articulate with single vertebra

2. **Tubercle with transverse process:**
   - Present in ribs 1-10
   - Absent in ribs 11-12

**Movements of Ribs:**
- **Pump-handle movement**: Upper ribs, increases AP diameter
- **Bucket-handle movement**: Lower ribs, increases transverse diameter

**Sternocostal Joints:**
- First rib: Synchondrosis (cartilaginous, immovable)
- Ribs 2-7: Synovial joints (slight movement)

**Intercostal Muscles:**
- External intercostals: Inspiration (elevate ribs)
- Internal intercostals: Expiration (depress ribs)
- Innermost intercostals: Expiration

### Level 5: Expert Integration

- Closed by diaphragm

**Congenital Anomalies:**
- Cervical rib: May cause thoracic outlet syndrome
- Bifid rib: Usually incidental
- Pectus excavatum: Sunken chest
- Pectus carinatum: Pigeon chest

**Surface Anatomy for Procedures:**

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Skull base fracture signs**: Raccoon eyes, Battle's sign, CSF rhinorrhea/otorrhea
2. **C-spine injury**: Assume with any significant trauma; immobilize
3. **Lumbar puncture level**: L3-L4 or L4-L5 (below cord termination)
4. **Chest tube placement**: Above rib to avoid intercostal NV bundle
5. **Rib fractures in elderly**: High morbidity, aggressive pain control essential

## Summary

The axial skeleton provides the central framework for the body, protecting vital organs while allowing controlled movement. Understanding the detailed anatomy of the skull, spine, and thoracic cage is essential for clinical practice, particularly in trauma, neurology, and procedural medicine.
