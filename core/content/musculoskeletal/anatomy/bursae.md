# Bursae

## Overview
Bursae (singular: bursa) are small, fluid-filled sacs that reduce friction between musculoskeletal structures. They contain synovial-like fluid and are located where tendons, muscles, or skin glide over bony prominences. Understanding bursae is essential for diagnosing and treating common inflammatory conditions affecting these structures.

## Structure and Function

### Level 1: Foundation
A **bursa** is a thin sac filled with slippery fluid that acts as a cushion between structures that would otherwise rub against each other.

**Main Functions:**
- Reduce friction
- Protect tendons and muscles from bone
- Allow smooth gliding movements

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Bursal Anatomy:**
- **Wall**: Thin synovial membrane (similar to joint lining)
- **Cavity**: Potential space with minimal fluid (1-3 mL)
- **Fluid**: Viscous, similar to synovial fluid
- **Nerve supply**: Rich in pain fibers

**Types of Bursae:**

| Type | Description | Examples |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Subcutaneous | Between skin and bone | Prepatellar, olecranon |
| Subfascial | Between fascia and bone | Subacromial |
| Subtendinous | Between tendon and bone | Retrocalcaneal |
| Submuscular | Between muscle and bone | Subscapular |

**Development:**
- Some bursae present at birth (anatomical)
- Others develop in response to friction (adventitious)
- Number varies between individuals

### Level 3: Clinical Application

**Major Clinically Significant Bursae:**

**Shoulder Region:**
| Bursa | Location | Clinical Significance |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Subacromial | Below acromion, above rotator cuff | Impingement syndrome |
| Subdeltoid | Below deltoid | Often continuous with subacromial |
| Subscapular | Between subscapularis and scapula | Rare inflammation |

**Elbow Region:**
| Bursa | Location | Clinical Significance |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Olecranon | Over olecranon process | "Student's elbow" |
| Radiobicipital | At biceps insertion | Rare |

**Hip Region:**
| Bursa | Location | Clinical Significance |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Trochanteric | Over greater trochanter | "Greater trochanteric pain syndrome" |
| Iliopsoas | Between iliopsoas and hip joint | May communicate with hip joint |
| Ischial | Over ischial tuberosity | "Weaver's bottom" |

**Knee Region:**
| Bursa | Location | Clinical Significance |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Prepatellar | Over patella | "Housemaid's knee" |
| Infrapatellar (superficial) | Over patellar tendon | "Clergyman's knee" |
| Infrapatellar (deep) | Between patellar tendon and tibia | Osgood-Schlatter related |
| Pes anserine | Medial tibia, below joint line | Common in OA, runners |
| Suprapatellar | Above patella, deep to quadriceps | Communicates with knee joint |
| Semimembranosus | Behind knee | Baker's cyst (popliteal cyst) |

**Ankle/Foot Region:**
| Bursa | Location | Clinical Significance |
|-------|----------|----------------------|
| Retrocalcaneal | Between Achilles and calcaneus | Haglund's deformity |
| Subcutaneous calcaneal | Over Achilles insertion | "Pump bump" |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms

**Bursitis - Pathophysiology:**

**Causes:**
1. **Mechanical/Overuse**: Repetitive friction
2. **Traumatic**: Direct blow
3. **Infectious**: Usually Staphylococcus aureus
4. **Inflammatory**: RA, gout, pseudogout
5. **Hemorrhagic**: Anticoagulation, trauma

**Pathological Progression:**
1. Initial irritation → increased fluid production
2. Synovial membrane thickening
3. Fibrous changes (chronic)
4. Possible calcification
5. Adhesions and limited mobility

**Clinical Features of Bursitis:**

| Finding | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Pain | Localized over bursa |
| Swelling | May be visible in superficial bursae |
| Warmth | Suggests infection or acute inflammation |
| Tenderness | Point tenderness over bursa |
| ROM | Usually preserved unless adjacent to joint |

**Septic vs. Aseptic Bursitis:**

| Feature | Septic | Aseptic |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Onset | Rapid | Gradual |
| Erythema | Marked | Mild or absent |
| Warmth | Significant | Variable |
| Fever | Often present | Usually absent |
| WBC count (aspirate) | >50,000 | <2,000 |
| Gram stain | May be positive | Negative |

### Level 5: Expert Integration

**Communication with Joints:**
Some bursae normally communicate with adjacent joints:
- Suprapatellar bursa ↔ Knee joint (nearly always)
- Iliopsoas bursa ↔ Hip joint (15-20%)
- Subscapular bursa ↔ Shoulder joint (variable)
- Gastrocnemio-semimembranosus bursa ↔ Knee joint (variable)

**Clinical Implications:**
- Joint effusion may extend into communicating bursa
- Infection can spread between structures
- Baker's cyst represents distension of gastrocnemio-semimembranosus bursa

**Specific Bursitis Syndromes:**

**Subacromial Bursitis:**
- Part of shoulder impingement syndrome
- Painful arc: 60-120° abduction
- Often coexists with rotator cuff pathology
- Treatment: Activity modification, PT, injection, surgery if refractory

**Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome:**
- Previously called "trochanteric bursitis"
- Often involves gluteal tendinopathy
- More common in women, ages 40-60
- Lateral hip pain, worse with lying on side
- Treatment: PT, weight management, injection

**Prepatellar Bursitis:**
- Direct trauma or repetitive kneeling
- Visible swelling over patella
- High risk for infection (skin flora)
- Treatment: Rest, aspiration if large, antibiotics if infected

**Olecranon Bursitis:**
- Trauma, gout, RA, or infection
- Easily visible and palpable swelling
- Must rule out septic bursitis
- Treatment: Compression, aspiration, antibiotics if septic

**Retrocalcaneal Bursitis:**
- Associated with Achilles tendinopathy
- Haglund's deformity: Prominent posterosuperior calcaneus
- Pain with dorsiflexion
- Treatment: Heel lifts, PT, surgery for Haglund's

**Baker's Cyst (Popliteal Cyst):**
- Not a true bursa; gastrocnemio-semimembranosus bursa distension
- Secondary to intra-articular knee pathology (OA, meniscus tear, RA)
- May rupture → mimics DVT
- Treatment: Address underlying knee pathology

## Diagnostic Approach

### Level 3: Clinical Application

**Physical Examination:**
1. Inspect for swelling, erythema
2. Palpate for tenderness, warmth, fluctuance
3. Assess joint ROM (usually preserved with isolated bursitis)
4. Special tests for underlying pathology

**Imaging:**
- **X-ray**: Rule out fracture, calcification
- **Ultrasound**: Best for superficial bursae; can guide aspiration
- **MRI**: Deep bursae, assess for communication with joint

**Aspiration:**
- Indicated if infection suspected
- Analyze for cell count, crystals, Gram stain, culture
- Therapeutic in large effusions

**Fluid Analysis:**

| Parameter | Normal | Inflammatory | Septic |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Color | Clear | Yellow | Purulent |
| Viscosity | High | Low | Low |
| WBC (/μL) | <200 | 2,000-50,000 | >50,000 |
| PMNs | <25% | 50-70% | >90% |
| Glucose | Near serum | Reduced | Very low |

## Treatment Principles

### Level 3: Clinical Application

**Conservative Management:**
1. Rest and activity modification
2. Ice (acute phase)
3. Compression (if appropriate)
4. NSAIDs
5. Padding (e.g., knee pads, elbow pads)
6. Physical therapy (address biomechanical factors)

**Aspiration/Injection:**
- Aspiration: Diagnostic and therapeutic
- Corticosteroid injection: Effective for non-infectious bursitis
- Must exclude infection before steroid injection

**Surgical Intervention:**
- Indicated for chronic, refractory cases
- Bursectomy (open or arthroscopic)
- Address underlying structural abnormality

**Septic Bursitis Treatment:**
- Aspiration (often serial)
- Antibiotics (cover Staphylococcus)
- Surgical drainage if no improvement

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Always rule out septic bursitis** in superficial bursae with warmth and erythema
2. **Prepatellar and olecranon** bursae are most prone to infection
3. **Greater trochanteric pain syndrome** often involves tendinopathy, not just bursitis
4. **Baker's cyst rupture** mimics DVT; check for knee pathology
5. **Communicating bursae** can spread infection to adjacent joints

## Summary

Bursae are friction-reducing structures found throughout the musculoskeletal system. While often overlooked, they become clinically significant when inflamed (bursitis). Understanding their locations, clinical presentations, and the distinction between septic and aseptic bursitis is essential for proper diagnosis and management. Most cases respond to conservative treatment, but septic bursitis requires prompt recognition and treatment to prevent serious complications.
