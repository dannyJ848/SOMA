# Calcium Metabolism

## Overview
Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body, with 99% stored in bones and teeth. It is essential for bone structure, muscle contraction, nerve transmission, blood clotting, and cellular signaling. Calcium homeostasis is tightly regulated by hormones that control intestinal absorption, renal excretion, and bone resorption/formation.

## Calcium Distribution and Functions

### Level 1: Foundation
**Total body calcium**: ~1000g in adults (99% in bones)

**Blood calcium**: ~8.5-10.5 mg/dL (2.1-2.6 mmol/L)
- **Ionized (free)**: 50% - physiologically active
- **Protein-bound**: 40% - mainly albumin
- **Complexed**: 10% - with citrate, phosphate

**Key Functions:**
- Bone and teeth structure
- Muscle contraction
- Nerve impulse transmission
- Blood clotting
- Cell signaling

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Calcium Balance:**

| Process | Daily Amount |
|---------|--------------|
| Dietary intake | ~1000 mg |
| Intestinal absorption | ~300-400 mg |
| Fecal excretion | ~600-700 mg |
| Urinary excretion | ~150-200 mg |
| Bone exchange | ~500 mg (bidirectional) |

**Ionized Calcium:**
- Only ionized calcium is biologically active
- pH affects protein binding:
  - Acidosis → ↑ ionized Ca²⁺ (less protein binding)
  - Alkalosis → ↓ ionized Ca²⁺ (more protein binding)
- Albumin correction: Corrected Ca = measured Ca + 0.8 × (4 - albumin)

### Level 3: Clinical Application

**Hormonal Regulation:**

| Hormone | Source | Effect on Calcium |
|---------|--------|-------------------|
| PTH | Parathyroid | ↑ Serum Ca²⁺ |
| Vitamin D | Skin, diet | ↑ Serum Ca²⁺ |
| Calcitonin | Thyroid C-cells | ↓ Serum Ca²⁺ |

**PTH Actions:**
1. **Bone**: Stimulates resorption → releases Ca²⁺
2. **Kidney**:
   - ↑ Ca²⁺ reabsorption (distal tubule)
   - ↓ Phosphate reabsorption (proximal tubule)
   - Stimulates 1α-hydroxylase → active vitamin D
3. **Indirect**: Increases intestinal absorption via vitamin D

**Vitamin D Actions:**
1. **Intestine**: ↑ Ca²⁺ and phosphate absorption
2. **Bone**: Promotes mineralization (adequate levels)
3. **Kidney**: ↑ Ca²⁺ reabsorption (minor effect)

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms

**Vitamin D Metabolism:**

```
Skin (UV-B) → 7-dehydrocholesterol → Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)
                                          ↓
Diet → Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) ───────┘
                                          ↓
                              Liver (25-hydroxylase)
                                          ↓
                              25(OH)D (calcidiol) - Storage form
                                          ↓
                              Kidney (1α-hydroxylase) ← PTH stimulates
                                          ↓
                              1,25(OH)₂D (calcitriol) - Active form
```

**1α-Hydroxylase Regulation:**
- Stimulated by: PTH, low phosphate, low calcium
- Inhibited by: FGF-23, high phosphate, high calcium, 1,25(OH)₂D

**Calcium Sensing Receptor (CaSR):**
- G-protein coupled receptor
- Located on parathyroid cells, kidney
- Senses extracellular Ca²⁺ levels
- High Ca²⁺ → ↓ PTH secretion
- Low Ca²⁺ → ↑ PTH secretion
- Mutations cause familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia or hypoparathyroidism

### Level 5: Expert Integration

**Integrated Calcium Homeostasis:**

**Response to Hypocalcemia:**
1. ↓ Ca²⁺ sensed by CaSR on parathyroid
2. ↑ PTH secretion
3. PTH effects:
   - ↑ Bone resorption → Ca²⁺ release
   - ↑ Renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption
   - ↑ 1α-hydroxylase → ↑ 1,25(OH)₂D
4. 1,25(OH)₂D effects:
   - ↑ Intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption
5. Net result: Serum Ca²⁺ normalized

**Response to Hypercalcemia:**
1. ↑ Ca²⁺ sensed by CaSR
2. ↓ PTH secretion
3. ↓ Bone resorption
4. ↓ Renal Ca²⁺ reabsorption (more excreted)
5. ↓ 1,25(OH)₂D synthesis
6. ↓ Intestinal absorption
7. Net result: Serum Ca²⁺ normalized

**FGF-23/Klotho Axis:**
- FGF-23: Secreted by osteocytes
- Requires Klotho co-receptor
- Actions:
  - ↓ Phosphate reabsorption (kidney)
  - ↓ 1α-hydroxylase activity
  - ↓ 1,25(OH)₂D levels
- Elevated in CKD → contributes to bone disease

## Calcium Disorders

### Level 3: Clinical Application

**Hypercalcemia (>10.5 mg/dL):**

**Causes (90% primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy):**
- Primary hyperparathyroidism (outpatients)
- Malignancy (inpatients)
  - PTHrP secretion (solid tumors)
  - Osteolytic metastases
  - 1,25(OH)₂D production (lymphoma)
- Vitamin D toxicity
- Granulomatous diseases (sarcoidosis, TB)
- Thiazides, lithium
- Milk-alkali syndrome
- Immobilization

**Symptoms ("Stones, Bones, Moans, Groans, Psychiatric Overtones"):**
- Kidney stones
- Bone pain, fractures
- Abdominal pain, constipation, nausea
- Muscle weakness, fatigue
- Confusion, depression, psychosis

**Treatment:**
1. IV fluids (saline diuresis)
2. Bisphosphonates (inhibit resorption)
3. Calcitonin (rapid but transient effect)
4. Denosumab (if bisphosphonates contraindicated)
5. Treat underlying cause

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms

**Hypocalcemia (<8.5 mg/dL):**

**Causes:**
- Hypoparathyroidism (post-surgical, autoimmune)
- Vitamin D deficiency
- Chronic kidney disease
- Hypomagnesemia (impairs PTH secretion)
- Acute pancreatitis
- Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PTH resistance)
- Hungry bone syndrome (post-parathyroidectomy)

**Symptoms:**
- Neuromuscular: Tetany, cramps, paresthesias
- Chvostek sign: Facial twitch with tap
- Trousseau sign: Carpopedal spasm with BP cuff
- Cardiac: Prolonged QT, arrhythmias
- Seizures (severe)

**Treatment:**
- Acute: IV calcium gluconate
- Chronic: Oral calcium + vitamin D
- Correct hypomagnesemia if present
- Monitor for rebound hypercalcemia

### Level 5: Expert Integration

**Primary Hyperparathyroidism:**
- Usually single adenoma (85%)
- Labs: ↑ Ca²⁺, ↑ PTH (or inappropriately normal)
- Urinary Ca²⁺: Usually elevated
- Complications: Osteoporosis, nephrolithiasis
- Treatment: Parathyroidectomy (symptomatic cases)

**Secondary Hyperparathyroidism:**
- Response to chronic hypocalcemia
- Common in CKD, vitamin D deficiency
- Labs: Low/normal Ca²⁺, ↑ PTH
- Treatment: Address underlying cause

**Tertiary Hyperparathyroidism:**
- Autonomous PTH secretion after prolonged secondary
- Usually in renal failure patients
- Labs: ↑ Ca²⁺, ↑ PTH
- Treatment: Parathyroidectomy if severe

**Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia (FHH):**
- CaSR mutation (inactivating)
- Mild hypercalcemia, low urinary Ca²⁺
- Ca/Cr clearance ratio <0.01
- Benign; no treatment needed
- Must distinguish from hyperparathyroidism

## Bone as Calcium Reservoir

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms

**Rapid Exchange:**
- Surface Ca²⁺ (exchangeable pool)
- Rapid equilibrium with ECF
- Does not require osteoclast activity

**Slow Exchange:**
- Requires bone remodeling
- Osteoclast resorption releases Ca²⁺
- PTH stimulates this process
- Chronic regulation mechanism

**Bone Mineralization:**
- Calcium + phosphate → hydroxyapatite [Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂]
- Requires adequate Ca²⁺, phosphate, vitamin D
- Alkaline phosphatase: Marker of osteoblast activity

**Disorders of Mineralization:**
- **Rickets** (children): Vitamin D deficiency → soft bones
- **Osteomalacia** (adults): Unmineralized osteoid accumulates
- **Hypophosphatemic rickets**: Phosphate wasting disorders

---

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Correct calcium for albumin** in hypoalbuminemia: Add 0.8 mg/dL per 1 g/dL albumin below 4
2. **Primary hyperparathyroidism**: Most common cause of hypercalcemia in outpatients
3. **Malignancy**: Most common cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients
4. **Vitamin D deficiency**: Measure 25(OH)D, not 1,25(OH)₂D (storage form vs. active)
5. **Hypocalcemia symptoms**: Check for Chvostek and Trousseau signs

---

## Summary

Calcium metabolism is a tightly regulated system involving PTH, vitamin D, and calcitonin working on bone, kidney, and intestine to maintain serum calcium levels. The calcium-sensing receptor detects changes and triggers appropriate hormonal responses. Understanding this system is essential for diagnosing and treating hypercalcemia, hypocalcemia, and metabolic bone diseases. The skeleton serves as both a structural support and the body's largest calcium reservoir.
