# Measuring Kidney Function: GFR and Creatinine

## Overview
Measuring kidney function is essential for detecting kidney disease, monitoring its progression, and adjusting medications that are cleared by the kidneys. The most important measure is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which tells us how well your kidneys filter blood. Since we cannot measure GFR directly in routine practice, we estimate it using blood tests, primarily creatinine. Understanding these tests helps you interpret your lab results, track your kidney health over time, and understand why your healthcare team monitors these values.

## Creatinine - The Key Blood Test

### Level 1: Foundation
**What is creatinine?**
- A waste product from normal muscle metabolism
- Produced at a relatively constant rate by your body
- Filtered out by healthy kidneys
- When kidneys don't filter well, creatinine builds up in blood

**Normal creatinine levels:**
- Men: 0.7-1.3 mg/dL
- Women: 0.6-1.1 mg/dL
- Higher levels suggest reduced kidney function
- Values vary by age, muscle mass, and lab

**Key point:** A higher creatinine generally means lower kidney function, but the number alone doesn't tell the whole story.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Why creatinine varies between people:**

Creatinine production depends on muscle mass:
- Muscular individuals naturally have higher creatinine
- Elderly with less muscle have lower creatinine
- Women typically have lower creatinine than men
- A "normal" creatinine in an elderly woman might actually represent poor kidney function
- A "high" creatinine in a bodybuilder might be normal for them

**How creatinine changes with kidney disease:**

| Kidney function | Typical creatinine change |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Normal (100%) | Baseline value |
| Mild reduction (60-89%) | Slight increase |
| Moderate reduction (30-59%) | 1.5-3 mg/dL |
| Severe reduction (15-29%) | 3-6 mg/dL |
| Kidney failure (<15%) | >6 mg/dL (variable) |

**Important limitation:**
- Creatinine doesn't rise significantly until you've lost about 50% of kidney function
- Early kidney disease can exist with "normal" creatinine
- This is why GFR estimation is more useful than creatinine alone

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Factors affecting creatinine beyond kidney function:**

**Increased creatinine (not kidney disease):**
- High protein meal (especially cooked meat)
- Creatine supplements
- Intense exercise
- Certain medications (trimethoprim, cimetidine)
- Increased muscle mass

**Decreased creatinine (may mask kidney disease):**
- Low muscle mass (elderly, malnourished)
- Liver disease (less creatine production)
- Pregnancy (increased kidney blood flow)
- Amputation or muscle-wasting diseases

**When creatinine changes matter:**
- Any increase from YOUR baseline is significant
- A change of 0.3 mg/dL or 50% increase suggests acute kidney injury
- Steady, gradual increases suggest progressive CKD
- Rapid increases need urgent evaluation

**Creatinine trends are more valuable than single values:**
Track your creatinine over time to understand your trajectory

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**The creatinine-GFR relationship:**

Creatinine and GFR have an inverse, non-linear relationship:
- When GFR drops from 120 to 60 (losing half), creatinine roughly doubles
- When GFR drops from 60 to 30 (losing another half), creatinine doubles again
- Small creatinine changes at low GFR represent large function losses
- Large creatinine changes at high GFR may represent smaller function losses

**Creatinine clearance:**
An older method to estimate kidney function:
- Requires 24-hour urine collection
- Measures actual creatinine removed
- More accurate in extreme body sizes
- Overestimates GFR slightly (some creatinine is secreted)
- Used for precise medication dosing in some situations

**Cystatin C - An alternative marker:**
- Protein produced by all cells at constant rate
- Not affected by muscle mass
- May be more accurate in elderly, very muscular, or malnourished
- More expensive test
- Used when creatinine-based estimates may be inaccurate

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Advanced creatinine considerations:**

**Creatinine kinetics in acute kidney injury:**
- Creatinine takes time to accumulate
- In rapid kidney failure, creatinine rises about 1-2 mg/dL per day
- Initial creatinine may underestimate injury severity
- Need serial measurements to see true trajectory

**Steady-state assumptions:**
Creatinine-based estimates assume:
- Creatinine production is constant
- Creatinine is only eliminated by kidneys
- Patient is in steady state (not acutely changing)
These assumptions fail in:
- Acute illness
- Rapidly changing kidney function
- Extreme dietary changes
- Muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis)

**Medication effects on creatinine:**
Some medications block creatinine secretion without affecting GFR:
- Trimethoprim (antibiotic)
- Cimetidine (acid reducer)
- Dolutegravir (HIV medication)
- Creatinine rises but kidney function unchanged
- Important not to misinterpret as kidney damage

## Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)

### Level 1: Foundation
**What is GFR?**
- The rate at which your kidneys filter blood
- Measured in milliliters per minute (mL/min) or adjusted for body size (mL/min/1.73m2)
- Higher GFR = better kidney function
- Normal GFR: approximately 90-120 mL/min/1.73m2
- GFR naturally declines slightly with age

**Why GFR is important:**
- Most accurate measure of overall kidney function
- Used to stage chronic kidney disease
- Guides medication dosing
- Helps predict progression and need for dialysis

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Estimated GFR (eGFR):**

In routine practice, GFR is estimated using equations that include:
- Serum creatinine level
- Age
- Sex
- Sometimes race (though this is changing)

**Common equations:**
- **CKD-EPI (2021)**: Most widely used, most accurate
- **MDRD**: Older equation, still reported by some labs
- **Cockcroft-Gault**: Uses creatinine clearance, for medication dosing

**Understanding your eGFR number:**

| eGFR | Kidney function | What it means |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| >90 | Normal or high | Kidneys working well |
| 60-89 | Mildly decreased | May be normal for age; watch closely |
| 45-59 | Mildly to moderately decreased | Increased monitoring needed |
| 30-44 | Moderately to severely decreased | Complications more common |
| 15-29 | Severely decreased | Preparation for kidney replacement |
| <15 | Kidney failure | Dialysis or transplant may be needed |

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**How to interpret your eGFR:**

**Context matters:**
- A 25-year-old with eGFR 75 needs investigation
- An 80-year-old with eGFR 75 may be normal for age
- Compare to YOUR previous values when possible
- Consider factors that might affect accuracy

**When eGFR may be inaccurate:**
- Very muscular or very thin individuals
- Amputees
- Acute kidney injury (rapidly changing)
- Extreme ages
- Pregnancy
- Certain diets (vegetarian, high protein)

**What to do with your eGFR:**

| eGFR | Recommended actions |
|------|---------------------|
| >60 | Annual monitoring if risk factors |
| 45-59 | Check every 6 months, watch for complications |
| 30-44 | Check every 3-4 months, nephrology referral |
| <30 | Nephrology care, prepare for kidney replacement |

**Using eGFR for medications:**
Many medications need dose adjustment based on eGFR:
- Metformin: Often held if eGFR <30
- NSAIDs: Avoid if eGFR <30
- Certain antibiotics: Dose reduction needed
- Some diabetes medications: Adjustments required
- Always check with pharmacist if concerned

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**GFR estimation equations in detail:**

**CKD-EPI 2021 (creatinine):**
- Most accurate equation for most patients
- Does not include race coefficient
- Accounts for age and sex
- Slightly underestimates GFR at higher levels

**Why the race coefficient was removed:**
- Originally included to account for average differences in muscle mass
- Created systematic issues in clinical care
- Kidney community moved to race-free equations
- Individual variation better captured by cystatin C if needed

**Combined creatinine-cystatin C equation:**
- Uses both markers
- More accurate than either alone
- Recommended when creatinine-based estimate uncertain
- Especially useful in:
  - Elderly patients
  - Extreme body composition
  - Vegetarians
  - When precision critical for decisions

**Measured GFR:**
Gold standard but rarely done clinically:
- Requires injecting a marker (iothalamate, iohexol)
- Measuring clearance over time
- Time-consuming and expensive
- Reserved for:
  - Living kidney donor evaluation
  - Research studies
  - When estimates unreliable and precision critical

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**GFR trajectories and progression:**

Understanding your GFR over time is more important than any single value:

**Calculating GFR slope:**
- Collect eGFR values over time
- Calculate rate of decline per year
- Normal aging: 0.5-1 mL/min/year decline
- Concerning: >3-5 mL/min/year decline
- Rapid progressors need aggressive intervention

**Acute vs. chronic GFR changes:**
- Acute: Days to weeks, potentially reversible
- Chronic: Months to years, often progressive
- Can coexist (acute-on-chronic)
- Distinguish by:
  - History of previous values
  - Kidney size on ultrasound (small = chronic)
  - Presence of anemia (suggests chronic)

**GFR variability:**
- Day-to-day variation of 5-10% is normal
- Dehydration temporarily lowers GFR
- After meals, GFR may increase slightly
- Don't overreact to single values
- Track trends over multiple measurements

**Predicting progression:**
Factors associated with faster GFR decline:
- Proteinuria (strongest predictor)
- Uncontrolled blood pressure
- Uncontrolled diabetes
- Continued smoking
- Recurrent acute kidney injury
- Certain underlying diseases

## Other Tests of Kidney Function

### Level 1: Foundation
**Beyond creatinine and GFR:**

- **Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)**: Another waste product; rises with kidney disease but also affected by protein intake and dehydration
- **Urinalysis**: Checks for blood, protein, and other abnormalities in urine
- **Urine protein**: Measures protein leaking into urine (sign of kidney damage)

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen):**
- Waste from protein breakdown
- Normal: 7-20 mg/dL
- Rises with kidney disease
- Also increases with: dehydration, high protein diet, GI bleeding, certain medications

**BUN/Creatinine ratio:**
- Normal ratio: 10:1 to 20:1
- High ratio (>20:1): Suggests dehydration or GI bleeding
- Low ratio (<10:1): Suggests liver disease or low protein intake

**Urinalysis - what it shows:**
| Finding | What it may indicate |
|---------|---------------------|
| Protein | Kidney damage (glomerular) |
| Blood | Kidney disease, stones, infection, cancer |
| White cells | Infection |
| Glucose | Diabetes (or very high blood sugar) |
| Casts | Kidney inflammation or damage |

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Proteinuria - a critical marker:**

**Types of protein tests:**
- **Dipstick**: Quick screen, semi-quantitative
- **Spot urine protein/creatinine ratio**: Convenient estimate
- **24-hour urine**: Most accurate but cumbersome
- **Albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR)**: Best for early detection

**Interpreting albumin/creatinine ratio:**

| UACR (mg/g) | Category | Significance |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| <30 | Normal to mildly increased | Reassuring |
| 30-300 | Moderately increased (microalbuminuria) | Early warning |
| >300 | Severely increased (macroalbuminuria) | Significant damage |

**Why proteinuria matters:**
- Early sign of kidney damage (before GFR drops)
- Predicts faster progression
- Increases cardiovascular risk
- Treatment target (ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria)
- Used with GFR to stage CKD

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Specialized kidney function tests:**

**Cystatin C:**
- Small protein filtered by glomerulus
- Not affected by muscle mass
- Can be used alone or with creatinine for eGFR
- More accurate in elderly, amputees, extreme body sizes
- Higher cost limits routine use

**Beta-2 microglobulin:**
- Another marker filtered by kidneys
- Used in some specific situations
- Can accumulate in dialysis patients
- Associated with dialysis-related amyloidosis

**Kidney imaging:**
- **Ultrasound**: Size, obstruction, cysts
- **CT scan**: Stones, masses, detailed anatomy
- **MRI**: Blood flow, detailed soft tissue
- **Nuclear medicine scans**: Function of each kidney separately

**Kidney biopsy:**
- Gold standard for diagnosis when cause unclear
- Shows specific disease affecting kidneys
- Guides treatment decisions
- Provides prognostic information
- Not needed in all cases

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Interpreting kidney function comprehensively:**

**The full kidney assessment includes:**
1. eGFR (and trajectory over time)
2. Albuminuria/proteinuria
3. Urinalysis findings
4. Blood pressure
5. Imaging (if indicated)
6. Underlying cause/diagnosis

**CKD staging uses both GFR and albuminuria:**

GFR stages:
- G1: eGFR >90
- G2: eGFR 60-89
- G3a: eGFR 45-59
- G3b: eGFR 30-44
- G4: eGFR 15-29
- G5: eGFR <15

Albuminuria stages:
- A1: UACR <30
- A2: UACR 30-300
- A3: UACR >300

**Risk grid:**
Combining these stages creates a risk grid:
- G1A1 (top-left): Low risk
- G5A3 (bottom-right): Very high risk
- Higher stage in either = more frequent monitoring and intervention

**Novel biomarkers (emerging):**
- NGAL: Early AKI marker
- KIM-1: Tubular injury marker
- TIMP-2 x IGFBP7: Predicts AKI risk
- Kidney injury molecule-1: Research use
- May improve early detection in future

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **eGFR is more useful than creatinine alone** - it accounts for age, sex, and provides standardized measure
2. **Track your numbers over time** - trends are more important than single values
3. **Normal creatinine doesn't guarantee normal kidneys** - especially in elderly or those with low muscle mass
4. **Proteinuria is a powerful predictor** - even with normal GFR, protein in urine signals risk
5. **Report all medications to your doctor** - many affect kidney function or creatinine levels

## Summary

Measuring kidney function relies primarily on blood creatinine and calculated eGFR. While creatinine is easy to measure, it has limitations based on muscle mass and may not rise until significant kidney function is lost. eGFR equations estimate actual filtering capacity and are used to stage kidney disease and guide treatment. Tracking your values over time provides the most useful information about your kidney health trajectory. Proteinuria testing complements GFR to give a complete picture of kidney damage and progression risk. Understanding these tests empowers you to participate in monitoring your kidney health and making informed decisions about your care.
