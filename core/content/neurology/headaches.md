## Migraine

### Understanding Migraine

**Complexity Level 1: Basic Understanding**

Migraine is not "just a headache." It's a neurological condition causing intense, often one-sided head pain along with other symptoms like nausea and sensitivity to light.

**Complexity Level 3: Detailed Explanation**

Migraine is a complex neurological disorder involving:
- Moderate to severe headache, often throbbing
- Typically affects one side of head (can affect both)
- Worsens with physical activity
- Lasts 4-72 hours if untreated
- Associated with nausea, vomiting, light sensitivity (photophobia), sound sensitivity (phonophobia)

**Migraine Phases:**

1. **Prodrome (hours to days before):**
   - Mood changes
   - Food cravings
   - Neck stiffness
   - Increased urination
   - Yawning

2. **Aura (20-60 minutes before or during headache):**
   - Visual disturbances (flashing lights, zigzag lines, blind spots)
   - Sensory symptoms (tingling, numbness)
   - Speech difficulties
   - Affects about 25% of migraine sufferers

3. **Headache:**
   - The main attack phase
   - Variable intensity and duration

4. **Postdrome (after headache resolves):**
   - "Migraine hangover"
   - Fatigue, difficulty concentrating
   - Mood changes

**Complexity Level 5: Pathophysiology**

Current understanding of migraine involves:

**Trigeminovascular System Activation:**
- Cortical spreading depression may trigger aura and activate trigeminal nerve
- Release of CGRP, substance P, and other neuropeptides
- Neurogenic inflammation and sensitization

**Brain Changes:**
- Altered cortical excitability
- Dysfunction in brainstem nuclei
- Hypothalamic involvement in prodrome symptoms

**Genetic Factors:**
- 50% heritability
- Multiple susceptibility genes identified
- Hemiplegic migraine: channelopathies

### Migraine Triggers

**Complexity Level 2: Common Triggers**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Hormonal | Menstruation, oral contraceptives, menopause |
| Dietary | Alcohol, caffeine, aged cheese, MSG, artificial sweeteners |
| Environmental | Bright lights, strong smells, weather changes |
| Sleep | Too much or too little, jet lag |
| Stress | During or after stressful periods |
| Physical | Intense exercise, skipped meals, dehydration |

**Trigger Management Tips:**
- Keep a headache diary
- Identify your personal triggers
