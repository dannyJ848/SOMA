# Movement Disorders: Understanding Conditions That Affect Motion

## Overview

Movement disorders are neurological conditions that cause abnormal movements - either too much movement (hyperkinetic) or too little movement (hypokinetic). These conditions affect how the body moves, though thinking and memory are usually preserved, at least initially.

**Types of Abnormal Movements:**
- **Tremor:** Rhythmic shaking
- **Bradykinesia:** Slowness of movement
- **Rigidity:** Stiffness
- **Dystonia:** Sustained muscle contractions causing abnormal postures
- **Chorea:** Flowing, dance-like movements
- **Myoclonus:** Sudden, brief jerks
- **Tics:** Repetitive movements or sounds

## Parkinson's Disease

### Understanding Parkinson's Disease

**Complexity Level 1: Basic Understanding**

Parkinson's disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects movement. It develops when brain cells that produce dopamine (a chemical messenger) stop working or die.

**Key Symptoms (The "Cardinal Features"):**
- Tremor (shaking), usually starting in one hand
- Slowness of movement (bradykinesia)
- Stiffness (rigidity)
- Balance and walking problems

**Complexity Level 3: Detailed Explanation**

**Motor Symptoms:**

*Tremor:*
- "Pill-rolling" tremor at rest
- Typically starts on one side
- Decreases with intentional movement
- Increases with stress, fatigue
- Present in 70-80% of patients

*Bradykinesia:*
- Most disabling feature
- Slowness starting and executing movements
- Decreased arm swing when walking
- Smaller handwriting (micrographia)
- Softer voice (hypophonia)
- Reduced facial expression (masked face)

*Rigidity:*
- Stiffness felt throughout movement range
- "Cogwheel" quality when combined with tremor
- Affects limbs, neck, trunk

*Postural Instability (develops later):*
- Impaired balance reflexes
- Increased fall risk
- Stooped posture
- Shuffling gait with small steps

**Non-Motor Symptoms (Often Overlooked):**

| Category | Symptoms |
|----------|----------|
| Cognitive | Slowed thinking, difficulty multitasking, later dementia in some |
| Psychiatric | Depression, anxiety, apathy, hallucinations |
| Sleep | Insomnia, REM sleep behavior disorder, daytime sleepiness |
| Autonomic | Constipation, urinary problems, low blood pressure, sweating |
| Sensory | Loss of smell (often early), pain, fatigue |

**Complexity Level 5: Pathophysiology**

**Dopamine System:**
- Loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta
- Dopamine depletion in striatum
- Disruption of basal ganglia circuitry
- Motor symptoms appear when ~50-60% of dopamine neurons lost

**Lewy Body Pathology:**
- Alpha-synuclein protein aggregates
- Spread through nervous system (Braak staging)
- May begin in gut or olfactory system
- Explains pre-motor symptoms

**Neuroinflammation:**
- Microglial activation
- Contributes to ongoing neurodegeneration

**Genetic Factors:**
- LRRK2, SNCA, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 mutations
- Most cases sporadic but genetic factors contribute

### Parkinson's Disease Treatment

**Complexity Level 2: Medication Overview**

**Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet, Rytary, others):**
- Most effective medication
- Levodopa converts to dopamine in brain
- Carbidopa prevents breakdown outside brain
- Taken multiple times daily
- Works best for bradykinesia and rigidity

**Other Medications:**
- Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine patch)
- MAO-B inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline, safinamide)
- COMT inhibitors (entacapone, opicapone)
- Anticholinergics (for tremor, younger patients)
- Amantadine (for dyskinesias)

**Complexity Level 4: Advanced Treatment Concepts**

**Motor Complications (After Years of Treatment):**

*Wearing Off:*
- Medication effect doesn't last until next dose
- Motor symptoms return before next dose due
- Managed by adjusting dose timing, adding medications

*Dyskinesias:*
- Involuntary movements at peak medication effect
- Flowing, dance-like movements
- Managed by adjusting doses, adding amantadine

*On-Off Fluctuations:*
- Unpredictable switching between good ("on") and poor ("off") states
- Complex management required

**Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS):**
- Surgical implantation of electrodes in specific brain areas
- Targets: subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus interna
- Reduces motor fluctuations and dyskinesias
- Reduces medication requirements
- Not a cure; doesn't slow progression
- Best for those with good levodopa response and motor complications

**Newer Therapies:**
- Continuous dopamine delivery (infusions)
- Focused ultrasound for tremor-dominant PD
- Gene therapy clinical trials
- Stem cell research ongoing

### Living with Parkinson's Disease

**Complexity Level 2: Daily Management**

**Medication Tips:**
- Take medications on schedule
- Protein can interfere with levodopa absorption
  - Some take levodopa 30-60 minutes before meals
  - Others distribute protein throughout day
- Keep medication diary
- Don't stop suddenly (can cause severe worsening)

**Exercise is Essential:**
- Improves mobility, balance, and mood
- May have neuroprotective effects
- Recommended activities:
  - Walking, cycling, swimming
  - Dance (tango, ballroom shown beneficial)
  - Boxing training (non-contact)
  - Tai Chi
  - Physical therapy exercises

**Complexity Level 3: Comprehensive Care**

**Care Team:**
- Movement disorder neurologist
- Physical therapist
- Occupational therapist
- Speech therapist
- Social worker
- Psychiatrist/psychologist (as needed)

**Managing Non-Motor Symptoms:**
- Depression: Often responds to antidepressants
- Constipation: Fiber, fluids, stool softeners
- Sleep problems: Sleep hygiene, medications as needed
- Low blood pressure: Increase salt, fluids; compression stockings; medication
- Cognitive issues: Cognitive therapy, specific medications

**Safety:**
- Fall prevention (remove rugs, improve lighting)
- Home modifications as needed
- Driving evaluation
- Advance care planning discussions

**Complexity Level 3: Progression and Prognosis**

**Typical Course:**
- Progresses over years to decades
- Rate varies significantly between individuals
- Early medication response typically excellent ("honeymoon period")
- Motor complications develop after 5-10 years in many patients
- Non-motor symptoms increasingly important over time

**Factors Associated with Faster Progression:**
- Older age at onset
- Rigidity/bradykinesia-dominant (vs. tremor-dominant)
- Associated cognitive impairment
- Minimal tremor
- Postural instability early

- May also affect head, voice
- Tends to run in families
- Often responds to alcohol (temporarily)

**Complexity Level 2: Detailed Characteristics**

**Tremor Features:**
- Action tremor (occurs during voluntary movement)
- Postural component (hands extended)
- Kinetic component (during movement)
- Frequency: 4-12 Hz
- Usually bilateral, may be asymmetric

**Commonly Affected Areas:**
- Hands (most common, 95%)
- Head (34%)
- Voice (12%)

**Complexity Level 3: Diagnosis**

**Essential Tremor vs. Parkinson's Disease:**

| Feature | Essential Tremor | Parkinson's Disease |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| When tremor occurs | During action | At rest |
| Body parts | Hands, head, voice | Hands, legs, chin |
| Symmetry | Usually bilateral | Starts one-sided |
| Other symptoms | Usually none | Bradykinesia, rigidity |
| Alcohol effect | Often improves | Little effect |
| Family history | Common | Less common |

**Testing:**
