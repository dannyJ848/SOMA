# Seizures and Epilepsy: Understanding, Managing, and Living Well

## Overview

Seizures are episodes of abnormal electrical activity in the brain that cause changes in behavior, movement, feelings, or consciousness. Epilepsy is a condition characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures.

**Key Distinctions:**
- **Seizure:** A single event of abnormal brain electrical activity
- **Epilepsy:** A condition with tendency for recurrent unprovoked seizures
- **Provoked seizure:** Seizure caused by temporary factor (fever, medication, etc.)

**Key Statistics:**
- 1 in 26 people will develop epilepsy in their lifetime
- 3.4 million people in the US have epilepsy
- 65 million people worldwide
- 70% of people with epilepsy can become seizure-free with treatment

## Types of Seizures

### Classification Overview

**Complexity Level 2: Basic Classification**

**Focal (Partial) Seizures:**
- Start in one area of the brain
- May spread to become generalized
- Symptoms depend on brain region affected

**Generalized Seizures:**
- Involve entire brain from the start
- Loss of consciousness typical
- Affect both sides of body

### Focal Seizures

**Complexity Level 3: Detailed Explanation**

**Focal Aware Seizures (formerly Simple Partial):**
- Person remains conscious and aware
- May experience:
  - Unusual sensations (tingling, visual disturbances, strange smells)
  - Emotional changes (fear, deja vu, joy)
  - Jerking of one body part
- Often called "aura" when preceding other seizure types
- Last seconds to 2 minutes

**Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures (formerly Complex Partial):**
- Consciousness affected - person appears confused or "out of it"
- May stare blankly
- Automatic behaviors (automatisms):
  - Lip smacking
  - Chewing
  - Hand fumbling
  - Walking aimlessly
- Person typically doesn't remember the seizure
- Last 1-3 minutes usually

**Focal to Bilateral Tonic-Clonic:**
- Starts focal, then spreads to involve whole brain
- May have warning (aura) before convulsions
- Previously called "secondary generalized"

### Generalized Seizures

**Complexity Level 3: Types of Generalized Seizures**

**Tonic-Clonic (Grand Mal) Seizures:**
- Most recognized seizure type
- **Tonic phase:** Muscles stiffen, person falls
- **Clonic phase:** Rhythmic jerking of limbs
- May have cry at onset, loss of bladder control
- Typically lasts 1-3 minutes
- Confusion afterward (postictal state)

**Absence Seizures (Petit Mal):**
- Brief staring episodes (5-20 seconds)
- May have subtle eye blinking or lip smacking
- Abrupt start and stop
- Person unaware, resumes activity immediately
- Common in children
- May occur dozens of times daily

**Myoclonic Seizures:**
- Brief, shock-like muscle jerks
- Usually affect neck, shoulders, upper arms
- Often occur shortly after waking
- Consciousness preserved
- May occur in clusters

**Atonic Seizures (Drop Attacks):**
- Sudden loss of muscle tone
- Person collapses without warning
- Brief (seconds)
- High injury risk
- Helmet often recommended

**Tonic Seizures:**
- Muscle stiffening without jerking
- Brief (seconds to 30 seconds)
- May cause falls if standing

**Clonic Seizures:**
- Rhythmic jerking without tonic stiffening
- Relatively uncommon in isolation

### Seizures in Special Situations

**Complexity Level 4: Context-Specific Seizures**

**Febrile Seizures:**
- Occur with fever in children (6 months to 5 years)
- Usually generalized tonic-clonic
- Typically brief and benign
- Most children do not develop epilepsy
- Simple vs. complex (duration, focal features)

**Status Epilepticus:**
- Seizure lasting >5 minutes, or
- Repeated seizures without recovery between
- **MEDICAL EMERGENCY**
- Requires immediate treatment
- Risk of brain damage

**Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES):**
- Not caused by abnormal electrical activity
- Related to psychological factors
- Look like seizures but different mechanism
- Need specialized evaluation
- Treatment involves therapy, not antiseizure medications

## First Aid for Seizures

### What to Do During a Seizure

**Complexity Level 1: Everyone Should Know**

**For Tonic-Clonic (Convulsive) Seizures:**

**DO:**
1. Stay calm
2. Time the seizure
3. Clear area of dangerous objects
4. Cushion the head
5. Loosen tight clothing around neck
6. Turn person on their side once jerking stops
7. Stay with them until fully recovered
8. Speak calmly and reassuringly

**DO NOT:**
- **DON'T** put anything in their mouth
- **DON'T** try to hold them down
- **DON'T** give food or water until fully alert
- **DON'T** try to stop the movements

**For Non-Convulsive Seizures (Staring, Confusion):**
- Stay with the person
- Gently guide away from danger
- Speak calmly
- Don't restrain unless dangerous
- Stay until fully aware

### When to Call 911

**Complexity Level 1: Emergency Situations**

**Call 911 if:**
- Seizure lasts more than 5 minutes
- Person doesn't wake up after seizure
- Another seizure starts before recovery
- Person is injured during seizure
- Person is pregnant
- Person has diabetes
- This is their first seizure
- Seizure happens in water
- Person has difficulty breathing afterward
- Person is not known to have epilepsy

**Complexity Level 2: After the Seizure**

**Recovery Period (Postictal State):**
- Confusion is normal
- May last minutes to hours
- Person may be tired, have headache
- May not remember the seizure
- Stay with them until recovered
- Help orient them gently

## Epilepsy Diagnosis

### Evaluation Process

**Complexity Level 3: What to Expect**

**History (Most Important):**
- Detailed description of events (witnesses essential)
- Triggers
- Warning signs (aura)
- What happened during episode
- Recovery period
- Past seizures
- Family history
- Risk factors (head injury, stroke, infection)

**Physical and Neurological Examination:**
- General health assessment
- Detailed neurological exam
- May be normal between seizures

**Testing:**

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| EEG | Detect abnormal electrical activity |
| MRI Brain | Identify structural causes |
| Blood Tests | Rule out metabolic causes |
| Sleep-Deprived EEG | Increase chance of capturing abnormalities |
| Video EEG Monitoring | Record seizures with simultaneous EEG |
| PET Scan | Locate seizure focus |

**Complexity Level 4: EEG Details**

**What EEG Shows:**

- Epileptiform discharges (spikes, sharp waves)
- Background activity
- Location of abnormal activity

**Limitations:**
- Single routine EEG is normal in 50% of people with epilepsy
- Abnormality doesn't always mean epilepsy
- May need repeated or prolonged monitoring

- Maintain quality of life
- Usually single medication (monotherapy)

**How They Work:**
- Stabilize electrical activity in brain
- Different mechanisms for different drugs
- Choice depends on seizure type, age, other factors

**General Principles:**
- Start low, increase slowly
- Give medication time to work
- Take consistently at same times
- Never stop suddenly (can trigger seizures)
- Report side effects

**Complexity Level 3: Common Medications**

| Medication | Common Uses | Notable Side Effects |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Levetiracetam (Keppra) | Broad spectrum | Irritability, fatigue |
| Lamotrigine (Lamictal) | Broad spectrum | Rash (serious potential), slow titration |
| Valproate (Depakote) | Broad spectrum, especially generalized | Weight gain, tremor, avoid in pregnancy |
| Carbamazepine (Tegretol) | Focal seizures | Rash, blood/liver effects, drug interactions |
| Oxcarbazepine (Trileptal) | Focal seizures | Low sodium, less interactions than carbamazepine |
| Lacosamide (Vimpat) | Focal seizures | Dizziness, cardiac effects |
| Topiramate (Topamax) | Broad spectrum | Cognitive effects, weight loss, kidney stones |
| Zonisamide (Zonegran) | Broad spectrum | Weight loss, kidney stones |
| Brivaracetam (Briviact) | Focal seizures | Less irritability than levetiracetam |
| Clobazam (Onfi) | Adjunctive, Lennox-Gastaut | Sedation |
