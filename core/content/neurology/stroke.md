# Stroke: Understanding Brain Attacks

## Overview

A stroke occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. Stroke is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment to minimize brain damage and potential complications.

**Key Statistics:**
- 5th leading cause of death in the United States
- Leading cause of serious long-term disability
- Someone has a stroke every 40 seconds
- 80% of strokes are preventable

## Types of Stroke

### Ischemic Stroke (87% of all strokes)

**Complexity Level 1: Basic Understanding**

An ischemic stroke happens when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the brain, similar to how a clogged pipe stops water flow.

**Complexity Level 3: Detailed Explanation**

Ischemic strokes occur when arteries supplying blood to the brain become narrowed or blocked. Two main mechanisms:

**Thrombotic Stroke:**
- Blood clot (thrombus) forms in arteries directly supplying the brain
- Often occurs in arteries damaged by atherosclerosis (fatty buildup)
- Can affect large or small blood vessels

**Embolic Stroke:**
- Blood clot or debris forms elsewhere in the body (usually heart or large arteries)
- Travels through bloodstream and lodges in smaller brain arteries
- Often related to atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat)

**Complexity Level 5: Advanced Understanding**

Ischemic stroke pathophysiology involves:

**Acute Phase:**
- Core infarct: Irreversible neuronal death within minutes of complete ischemia
- Ischemic penumbra: Surrounding tissue at risk but potentially salvageable
- Cerebral blood flow thresholds:
  - Normal: 50-55 mL/100g/min
  - Electrical failure: <20 mL/100g/min
  - Membrane failure/cell death: <10 mL/100g/min

**Molecular Cascade:**
- ATP depletion leading to ionic pump failure
- Glutamate excitotoxicity
- Calcium influx triggering cell death pathways
- Free radical formation and oxidative stress
- Inflammation and blood-brain barrier breakdown

### Hemorrhagic Stroke (13% of all strokes)

**Complexity Level 1: Basic Understanding**

A hemorrhagic stroke happens when a blood vessel in the brain bursts and bleeds, damaging brain tissue.

**Complexity Level 3: Detailed Explanation**

**Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH):**
- Bleeding directly into brain tissue
- Most commonly caused by high blood pressure
- Damages brain both from blood accumulation and increased pressure

**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH):**
- Bleeding in the space between brain and surrounding membrane
- Often caused by ruptured aneurysm (weakened blood vessel wall)
- Characterized by sudden, severe "thunderclap" headache

**Complexity Level 5: Advanced Understanding**

**Intracerebral Hemorrhage Mechanisms:**
- Hypertensive vasculopathy: Chronic hypertension causes lipohyalinosis and microaneurysms in small penetrating arteries
- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: Amyloid protein deposits weaken vessel walls (common in elderly)
- Vascular malformations: AVMs, cavernomas, dural fistulas
- Coagulopathy: Anticoagulant use, bleeding disorders

**Secondary Injury:**
- Mass effect and herniation risk
- Hematoma expansion (common in first 24 hours)
- Perihematomal edema
- Intraventricular extension and hydrocephalus
- Vasospasm (particularly in SAH)

## FAST Recognition: Saving Lives Through Early Detection

### The FAST Method

**Complexity Level 1: Everyone Must Know This**

**F - FACE:** Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?

**A - ARMS:** Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward?

**S - SPEECH:** Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is speech slurred or strange?

**T - TIME:** If you observe any of these signs, call 911 immediately!

**Remember: Time = Brain. Every minute matters.**

### Extended BE-FAST Recognition

**Complexity Level 2: Additional Warning Signs**

**B - BALANCE:** Sudden loss of balance or coordination

**E - EYES:** Sudden vision changes, double vision, or vision loss

**F - FACE:** Facial drooping

**A - ARMS:** Arm weakness

**S - SPEECH:** Speech difficulty

**T - TIME:** Time to call 911

### Other Stroke Warning Signs

**Complexity Level 3: Complete Symptom Recognition**

- Sudden severe headache with no known cause
- Sudden confusion or trouble understanding
- Sudden numbness or weakness (especially on one side)
- Sudden trouble walking or dizziness
- Sudden vision problems in one or both eyes

**Important Notes:**
- Symptoms typically occur suddenly
- May occur during sleep (wake-up stroke)
- Symptoms may fluctuate or briefly resolve (don't ignore!)
- Women may have additional symptoms: general weakness, fatigue, nausea

### What NOT to Do

- Don't wait to see if symptoms improve
- Don't drive yourself to the hospital
- Don't take aspirin unless instructed by 911 dispatcher
- Don't give food or water (swallowing may be impaired)
- Don't let embarrassment delay calling for help

## Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) - "Mini-Stroke"

### Understanding TIA

**Complexity Level 2: The Warning Stroke**

A TIA produces stroke-like symptoms that resolve completely, usually within minutes to hours. It's a critical warning sign.

**Key Points:**
- Symptoms identical to stroke but temporary
- Medical emergency requiring immediate evaluation
- 10-15% of TIA patients have stroke within 90 days
- Highest risk in first 48 hours

**Complexity Level 3: Why TIA Matters**

**TIA vs. Stroke:**
- TIA: No permanent brain damage on imaging
- Stroke: Lasting brain damage
- Clinically indistinguishable initially - treat as stroke until proven otherwise

**Risk Assessment (ABCD2 Score):**
| Factor | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Age ≥60 | 1 |
| BP ≥140/90 | 1 |
| Clinical Features | Weakness: 2, Speech only: 1 |
| Duration | ≥60 min: 2, 10-59 min: 1 |
| Diabetes | 1 |

Higher scores indicate higher stroke risk.

### TIA Management

**Immediate Workup:**
- Brain imaging (CT or MRI)
- Vessel imaging (CT angiography, MR angiography, or ultrasound)
- Heart rhythm monitoring
- Blood tests (glucose, lipids, complete blood count)
- Echocardiogram

**Treatment:**
- Start antiplatelet therapy immediately
- Address underlying risk factors
- Carotid intervention if significant stenosis
- May require hospitalization for high-risk features

**After TIA:**
- All secondary prevention measures apply
- Close follow-up initially
- Lifestyle modifications essential
- Know warning signs and when to seek help

**Intravenous Thrombolysis (tPA/Alteplase or Tenecteplase):**
- Clot-dissolving medication
- Must be given within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
- Careful patient selection (exclusion criteria)
- Restores blood flow in many patients
- Benefits decrease with time delay

**Mechanical Thrombectomy:**
- Catheter-based clot removal
- For large vessel occlusions
- Can be performed up to 24 hours in select patients
- Combined with tPA when appropriate
- Dramatic outcomes possible

**Treatment Timeline:**
- "Door-to-needle" target: 60 minutes for tPA
- "Door-to-puncture" target: 90 minutes for thrombectomy
- Every 15-minute delay in treatment reduces good outcomes

### Stroke Center Certification

**Complexity Level 3: Where to Go**

**Levels of Stroke Care:**
- **Primary Stroke Center:** Can give tPA, stabilize, transfer
- **Comprehensive Stroke Center:** Full range of treatments including thrombectomy
- **Thrombectomy-Capable Center:** Intermediate level

**Know Your Local Resources:**
