      "explanation": "When a doctor takes a sample of cancer (a biopsy), a specialist called a pathologist looks at it under a microscope. They want to see how different the cancer cells look compared to normal, healthy cells.\n\nThink of it like comparing handwriting:\n- Grade 1 (low grade): The writing is neat and readable - the cancer cells still look somewhat like normal cells. These cancers usually grow slowly.\n- Grade 2 (intermediate grade): The writing is getting messier - the cells look more abnormal.\n- Grade 3 (high grade): The writing is very messy - the cells look very different from normal. These cancers usually grow faster.\n\nGrade is different from stage:\n- Stage tells you WHERE the cancer is and if it has spread\n- Grade tells you HOW abnormal the cells look\n\nBoth pieces of information help your doctors plan the best treatment. Low-grade cancers might need less aggressive treatment, while high-grade cancers might need stronger treatment to control them.",

      "explanation": "**What Pathologists Look For**\n\nWhen grading cancer, pathologists examine several features:\n\n1. **Differentiation**: How much do cancer cells resemble their normal counterparts?\n   - Well-differentiated: Cells look fairly normal, maintain tissue architecture\n   - Moderately differentiated: Cells show some abnormality\n   - Poorly differentiated: Cells look very abnormal, chaotic arrangement\n   - Undifferentiated: Cells are so abnormal the tissue of origin may be hard to identify\n\n2. **Mitotic rate**: How fast are cells dividing?\n   - More dividing cells (mitoses) = more aggressive tumor\n\n3. **Necrosis**: Areas of dead cells within the tumor\n   - More necrosis often indicates faster growth outpacing blood supply\n\n**Common Grading Systems**\n\n*General grading (GX, G1-G4):*\n- GX: Grade cannot be assessed\n- G1: Well-differentiated (low grade)\n- G2: Moderately differentiated (intermediate grade)\n- G3: Poorly differentiated (high grade)\n- G4: Undifferentiated (high grade)\n\n*Breast cancer (Nottingham/Bloom-Richardson grade):*\n- Scores tubule formation, nuclear features, and mitotic count\n- Combined score: Grade 1 (3-5), Grade 2 (6-7), Grade 3 (8-9)\n\n*Prostate cancer (Gleason score):*\n- Two most common patterns (1-5) are added\n- Gleason 6 = low risk, Gleason 7 = intermediate, Gleason 8-10 = high risk\n- Now reported as Grade Groups 1-5\n\n**Grade vs. Stage**\n| Feature | Grade | Stage |\n|---------|-------|-------|\n| What it measures | How abnormal cells look | Where cancer is located |\n| Based on | Microscope examination | Imaging and surgery |\n| Indicates | How fast cancer might grow | How far cancer has spread |",
