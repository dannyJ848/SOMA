      "explanation": "When doctors find cancer, one of the first things they want to know is: how far has it spread? This is called staging.\n\nThink of staging like describing how far a fire has spread:\n- Stage 1: A small fire in one room\n- Stage 2: A larger fire, but still in one area\n- Stage 3: Fire has spread to nearby rooms\n- Stage 4: Fire has spread to other parts of the house\n\nDoctors use tests like CT scans, MRIs, and sometimes surgery to figure out the stage. This information helps them:\n- Understand how serious the cancer is\n- Choose the best treatment\n- Give you an idea of what to expect\n\nGenerally, cancers caught at earlier stages have better outcomes because they're smaller and haven't spread yet. This is why cancer screening is so important - it can find cancer before it grows and spreads.\n\nRemember: Your stage is just one piece of information. Many people with advanced stage cancer do well with treatment, and doctors consider many factors when planning your care.",

      "explanation": "**AJCC 8th Edition Framework**\n\nThe current AJCC staging (8th edition, 2018) incorporates:\n\n1. **Anatomic staging (TNM)**: Traditional extent-based criteria\n2. **Prognostic staging**: Adds biologic factors for selected cancers\n3. **Biomarkers**: ER/PR/HER2 for breast, CEA for colorectal, etc.\n4. **Grade**: Histologic differentiation assessment\n\n**T Category Specifics by Cancer Type**\n\nT definitions vary by tumor type:\n- *Breast*: T1 (≤2cm), T2 (>2-5cm), T3 (>5cm), T4 (chest wall/skin involvement)\n- *Colon*: Based on depth of invasion (mucosa → submucosa → muscularis → serosa)\n- *Lung*: T1 (≤3cm), T2 (>3-5cm), T3 (>5-7cm), T4 (>7cm or invasion)\n- *Melanoma*: Based on thickness (Breslow depth) and ulceration\n\n**Nodal Assessment**\n\n- Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB): Identifies first draining nodes\n- Regional lymphadenectomy: Removal and examination of node basin\n- N staging often requires minimum node count for accuracy\n- Micrometastases (0.2-2mm) vs. isolated tumor cells (<0.2mm)\n- Extranodal extension (ENE) worsens prognosis in some cancers\n\n**Staging Modalities**\n\n- CT chest/abdomen/pelvis: Standard for solid tumors\n- PET-CT: Functional imaging detecting metabolically active disease\n- MRI: Superior for brain, liver, soft tissue\n- Bone scan: Skeletal metastases\n- Endoscopic ultrasound: T staging for GI tumors\n- Laparoscopy: Peritoneal staging for gastric, pancreatic cancers\n\n**Stage Migration (Will Rogers Phenomenon)**\n\nImproved imaging detects previously unrecognized metastatic disease, 'upgrading' patients. This artificially improves survival statistics for all stages without changing actual outcomes.\n\n**Stage-Specific Survival**\n\nSurvival statistics are reported as 5-year survival rates by stage, but individual prognosis depends on many factors beyond stage.",
