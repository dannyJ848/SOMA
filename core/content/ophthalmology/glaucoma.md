# Glaucoma: The Silent Thief of Sight

Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, typically associated with elevated eye pressure. It is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, but with early detection and treatment, vision loss can be prevented or slowed.

## Understanding Glaucoma

### The Optic Nerve

The optic nerve is a cable of over one million nerve fibers connecting your eye to your brain. It carries visual information from the retina to be processed into images. Once optic nerve fibers are damaged, they cannot regenerate.

### How Glaucoma Damages Vision

In glaucoma:
1. Eye pressure (or other factors) damages optic nerve fibers
2. Peripheral vision is typically lost first
3. Damage progresses slowly and silently
4. Central vision is affected in advanced stages
5. Complete blindness can occur without treatment

**Why It's Called "The Silent Thief of Sight":**
- Early glaucoma has no symptoms
- You don't feel elevated eye pressure
- Vision loss occurs so gradually it's often unnoticed
- Each eye compensates for the other's blind spots
- By the time people notice vision loss, significant damage has occurred

## Eye Pressure and Fluid Dynamics

### Aqueous Humor

The front of your eye contains a clear fluid called aqueous humor that:
- Nourishes the cornea and lens
- Maintains eye shape and pressure
- Is constantly produced and drained

**The Balance:**
- Produced by the ciliary body (behind the iris)
- Flows through the pupil into the front chamber
- Drains through the trabecular meshwork and canal of Schlemm
- When drainage is impaired, pressure builds

### Intraocular Pressure (IOP)

**Normal Range:**
- Generally 10-21 mmHg
- Varies throughout the day
- Affected by position, activities, medications

**Important Points:**
- Elevated IOP is a risk factor, not a definition of glaucoma
- Some people with high pressure never develop glaucoma
- Some people develop glaucoma with normal pressure
- The relationship is individual

## Types of Glaucoma

### Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG)

**Most Common Type (90% of cases)**

The drainage angle appears open, but fluid drains too slowly.

**Characteristics:**
- Develops gradually over years
- Usually no symptoms until advanced
- Affects both eyes, though often unevenly
- Typically associated with elevated IOP
- Responds well to treatment if caught early

### Normal-Tension Glaucoma (NTG)

**Glaucoma with Normal Eye Pressure**

Optic nerve damage occurs despite pressure in normal range.

**Characteristics:**
- May involve factors beyond pressure (blood flow, nerve sensitivity)
- More common in people of Japanese descent
- Associated with certain systemic conditions
- May require lower target pressure than standard

### Angle-Closure Glaucoma

**Two Forms:**

*Acute Angle-Closure:*
- **Medical Emergency**
- Drainage angle suddenly and completely blocks
- Pressure rises rapidly and severely
- Causes severe symptoms (see Emergency Signs section)
- Requires immediate treatment to prevent vision loss

*Chronic Angle-Closure:*
- Angle closes gradually
- May be symptom-free like open-angle
- More common in certain populations (Asian, hyperopic)

### Secondary Glaucomas

**Caused by Other Conditions:**

*Pseudoexfoliative Glaucoma:*
- Flaky material clogs drainage
- Higher pressures, can be difficult to control
- More common with age and certain ancestry

*Pigmentary Glaucoma:*
- Pigment from iris clogs drainage
- Often affects young, myopic men
- Can fluctuate with exercise

*Neovascular Glaucoma:*
- Abnormal blood vessels block drainage
- Associated with diabetic retinopathy, vein occlusions
- Difficult to treat; requires managing underlying cause

*Steroid-Induced Glaucoma:*
- Caused by steroid use (eye drops, systemic)
- Usually reversible if caught early
- Requires monitoring if on long-term steroids

*Traumatic Glaucoma:*
- Results from eye injury
- May develop years after trauma
- Requires lifelong monitoring after eye injuries

### Congenital/Developmental Glaucoma

**Present at Birth or Early Childhood:**
- Abnormal drainage system development
- Signs: large eyes, light sensitivity, tearing
- Requires surgical treatment
- Early intervention critical for vision

## Risk Factors

### Major Risk Factors

- **Age**: Risk increases significantly after 40; highest after 60
- **Elevated eye pressure**: Most important modifiable risk factor
- **Family history**: 4-9 times higher risk if parent/sibling affected
- **Race/ethnicity**:
  - African Americans: Earlier onset, more severe, 6-8x higher blindness risk
  - Hispanics: Higher risk, especially with age
  - Asians: Higher angle-closure risk

### Other Risk Factors

- **Thin central cornea**: May underestimate true pressure
- **High myopia**: Associated with open-angle glaucoma
- **High hyperopia**: Associated with angle-closure
- **Diabetes**: Increases risk
- **Previous eye injuries**
- **Steroid use**
- **Sleep apnea**: May affect optic nerve blood flow

## Symptoms and Warning Signs

### Open-Angle Glaucoma

**Early Disease:**
- No symptoms (this is the problem)
- No pain
- No awareness of elevated pressure
- Vision seems normal

**Progressive Disease:**
- Gradual peripheral vision loss (may not notice)
- Bumping into objects
- Difficulty with side vision while driving
- "Tunnel vision" in advanced disease
- Central vision loss only in end stage

### Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma

## EMERGENCY - Seek Immediate Care

**Symptoms:**
- Severe eye pain
- Headache (often severe)
- Nausea and vomiting
- Blurred vision
- Halos around lights (rainbow-colored rings)
- Red eye
- Mid-dilated, fixed pupil

**This is a medical emergency.** Permanent vision loss can occur within hours without treatment.

## Diagnosis

### Comprehensive Eye Examination

**Tonometry**
- Measures intraocular pressure
- Multiple methods (air puff, applanation, rebound)
- Single reading is just a snapshot; may need multiple measurements

**Gonioscopy**
- Views the drainage angle using a special lens
- Determines if angle is open or narrow
- Critical for classifying glaucoma type

**Ophthalmoscopy/Fundoscopy**
- Direct viewing of optic nerve
- Looks for characteristic glaucomatous changes:
  - Enlarged cup-to-disc ratio
  - Notching or thinning of neural rim
  - Disc hemorrhages
  - Nerve fiber layer loss

**Pachymetry**
- Measures corneal thickness
- Thin corneas may underestimate pressure
- Thick corneas may overestimate pressure
- Helps interpret IOP readings

### Visual Field Testing

- Maps peripheral and central vision
- Detects characteristic patterns of loss
- Monitors progression over time
- Usually done every 6-12 months

**Typical Glaucomatous Patterns:**
- Arcuate (arc-shaped) defects
- Nasal step
- Paracentral scotomas
- Progression to tunnel vision

### Imaging

**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)**
- Measures retinal nerve fiber layer thickness
- Detects damage before vision loss occurs
- Tracks changes over time
- Can show structural damage before functional loss

**Optic Nerve Photography**
- Baseline documentation
- Comparison over time
- Detects subtle changes

**Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT)**
- 3D imaging of optic nerve head
- Quantitative analysis of changes

## Treatment

### Treatment Goals

**Primary Goal:** Prevent vision loss by lowering eye pressure

Glaucoma damage cannot be reversed, but progression can be slowed or stopped with treatment.

**Target Pressure:**
- Determined individually
- Based on current damage, risk factors, baseline pressure
- Typically 20-30% below baseline
- Adjusted based on progression

### Eye Drop Medications

**Prostaglandin Analogs**
- First-line treatment for most patients
- Examples: latanoprost, travoprost, bimatoprost
- Usually once daily (evening)
- Increase fluid drainage through alternate pathway
- Side effects: may darken iris/lashes, eye redness

**Beta-Blockers**
- Examples: timolol, betaxolol
- Usually twice daily
- Decrease fluid production
- Side effects: may affect heart rate, breathing; fatigue

**Alpha Agonists**
- Examples: brimonidine, apraclonidine
- Decrease production and increase drainage
- Usually twice or three times daily
- Side effects: dry mouth, fatigue, allergic reactions

**Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors**
- Examples: dorzolamide, brinzolamide
- Decrease fluid production
- Usually twice or three times daily
- Side effects: bitter taste, stinging

**Rho Kinase Inhibitors**
- Example: netarsudil
- Newer class; increases conventional outflow
- Once daily
- Side effects: eye redness, deposits on cornea

**Combination Drops**
- Combine two medications in one bottle
- Improve compliance
- Reduce preservative exposure

### Laser Treatments

**Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (SLT)**
- Laser applied to drainage system
- Improves fluid outflow
- Can be first-line treatment or add-on to drops
- Can be repeated
- Effect may wear off over years

**Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI)**
- Treatment/prevention for angle-closure
- Creates hole in iris for fluid to bypass blocked angle
- Outpatient procedure
- May prevent acute attacks

**Laser Iridoplasty**
- Reshapes iris to open angle
- Used when iridotomy alone insufficient

### Surgical Treatments

**Microinvasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS)**
- Newer, less invasive procedures
- Often combined with cataract surgery
- Examples: iStent, Hydrus, goniotomy
- Lower risk profile than traditional surgery
- Moderate pressure reduction

**Trabeculectomy**
- Traditional glaucoma surgery
- Creates new drainage pathway under the conjunctiva
- More significant pressure lowering
- Requires close post-operative monitoring
- Risks: infection, low pressure, failure over time

**Glaucoma Drainage Devices (Tubes)**
- Tube diverts fluid to reservoir under the conjunctiva
- Examples: Ahmed, Baerveldt valves
- Used for more advanced or refractory glaucoma
- Long-term pressure control

**Cyclodestructive Procedures**
- Reduce fluid production by treating ciliary body
- Used when other options exhausted
- Examples: cyclophotocoagulation
