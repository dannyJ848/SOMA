# Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)

Age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 50 in developed countries. It affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for detailed, central vision.

## Understanding the Macula

### What Is the Macula?

The macula is a small, specialized area at the center of the retina:
- About 5-6 mm in diameter
- Contains the highest concentration of cone photoreceptors
- Responsible for central vision used for:
  - Reading
  - Recognizing faces
  - Driving
  - Seeing fine detail
  - Distinguishing colors

### The Fovea

The very center of the macula:
- Provides the sharpest vision (20/20 or better)
- Contains only cones (no rods)
- What you use when looking directly at something

### Why the Macula Is Vulnerable

The macula has extremely high metabolic demands:
- Processes most detailed visual information
- Generates significant waste products
- Requires robust blood supply
- Accumulates damage over decades

## Types of AMD

### Dry AMD (Atrophic AMD)

**Most Common Form (85-90% of cases)**

**Characteristics:**
- Gradual breakdown of light-sensitive cells
- Accumulation of drusen (yellow deposits) under the retina
- Progressive thinning of the macula
- Usually progresses slowly over years

**Stages:**

*Early AMD:*
- Medium-sized drusen (63-124 micrometers)
- Usually no symptoms
- Detected during eye exam

*Intermediate AMD:*
- Large drusen (>125 micrometers)
- Pigment changes in the macula
- May have mild vision changes
- Higher risk of progression

*Advanced Dry AMD (Geographic Atrophy):*
- Large areas of macula degenerate
- Significant central vision loss
- Blind spots in central vision
- Currently no approved treatments (emerging therapies)

### Wet AMD (Neovascular AMD)

**Less Common but More Severe (10-15% of cases)**

**Characteristics:**
- Abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina
- Vessels leak fluid and blood
- Can cause rapid, severe vision loss
- Requires prompt treatment

**How It Develops:**
1. In response to cellular stress, the eye produces growth factors
2. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulates new vessel growth
3. New vessels are fragile and abnormal
4. Leakage causes swelling and bleeding
5. Scar tissue forms, destroying photoreceptors

**Important:** Any stage of dry AMD can convert to wet AMD at any time.

## Symptoms

### Early/Intermediate Dry AMD

**Often No Symptoms:**
- May be detected only during eye exam
- Vision may seem normal

**Possible Early Symptoms:**
- Slightly blurry central vision
- Need for more light when reading
- Difficulty adapting from bright to dim light
- Colors appearing less vivid
- Mild difficulty recognizing faces

### Advanced Dry AMD (Geographic Atrophy)

- Blurred or blind spot in central vision
- Difficulty reading even with glasses
- Straight lines appearing wavy or distorted
- Faces appearing distorted or hard to recognize
- Colors appearing washed out

### Wet AMD

**Symptoms Often Rapid:**
- Sudden distortion of straight lines (metamorphopsia)
- Rapid development of blurry central vision
- Dark or empty area in central vision
- Colors appearing washed out

## Warning Sign: Use an Amsler Grid

The Amsler grid is a simple test you can do at home:
- Grid of straight lines with a central dot
- Hold at reading distance, one eye at a time
- Look at center dot
- Note if any lines appear wavy, distorted, or missing

**If lines appear wavy or distorted, especially if new or changing, contact your eye doctor promptly.**

## Diagnosis

### Comprehensive Eye Examination

**Visual Acuity Test:**
- Measures how well you see at distance
- Charts letters or symbols

**Dilated Fundus Exam:**
- Eye drops widen the pupil
- Doctor views macula and retina directly
- Can see drusen, pigment changes, bleeding

**Amsler Grid:**
- Detects central vision distortion
- Useful for monitoring at home

### Imaging Tests

**Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):**
- Cross-sectional images of the retina
- Detects fluid, swelling, and atrophy
- Measures retinal thickness
- Critical for monitoring wet AMD treatment
- Non-invasive, takes seconds

**Fluorescein Angiography:**
- Dye injected into arm
- Photographs taken as dye passes through retinal vessels
- Detects leaking abnormal vessels
- Shows pattern and extent of wet AMD

**OCT Angiography (OCTA):**
- Newer technique
- Visualizes blood vessels without dye injection
- Can detect abnormal vessel growth

**Fundus Photography:**
- High-resolution photos of the macula
- Documents drusen, pigment changes, atrophy
- Baseline for monitoring progression

## Treatment

### Dry AMD

**Currently No Treatment to Reverse Damage**

**Nutritional Supplements (AREDS2 Formula):**
Based on large clinical trials, these supplements may slow progression in intermediate or advanced dry AMD:
- Vitamin C: 500 mg
- Vitamin E: 400 IU
- Zinc: 80 mg (with copper 2 mg)
- Lutein: 10 mg
- Zeaxanthin: 2 mg

**Important Notes:**
- Not recommended for early AMD or no AMD
- Talk to your doctor before starting
- Not a cure; may slow progression by 25%
- Smokers should not take beta-carotene (original AREDS)

**Emerging Treatments for Geographic Atrophy:**
- Complement inhibitors (pegcetacoplan, avacincaptad pegol)
- Recently FDA approved
- Given as eye injections
- Slow but don't stop progression

### Wet AMD

**Anti-VEGF Injections**

The primary treatment for wet AMD:
- Block vascular endothelial growth factor
- Stop abnormal vessel growth and leakage
- Can stabilize or improve vision

**Medications:**
- Ranibizumab (Lucentis)
- Aflibercept (Eylea)
- Bevacizumab (Avastin - off-label)
- Brolucizumab (Beovu)
- Faricimab (Vabysmo - also targets Ang-2)

**How Treatment Works:**
1. Eye is numbed with drops
2. Antiseptic applied
3. Tiny needle injects medication into vitreous
4. Takes seconds; usually minimal discomfort
5. Repeated at regular intervals

**Treatment Schedule:**
- Initial loading doses (monthly for several months)
- Ongoing treatment based on response
- May be monthly, every 2 months, or "treat and extend"
- Often needed indefinitely

**Outcomes:**
- About 95% maintain vision with treatment
- About 30-40% experience vision improvement
- Without treatment, most lose significant vision

**Other Treatments:**

*Photodynamic Therapy (PDT):*
- Less commonly used now
- Light-activated medication destroys abnormal vessels
- May be combined with anti-VEGF

*Thermal Laser:*
- Rarely used
- Only for specific cases away from fovea
- Causes permanent scar

- Dry AMD progresses slowly; wet AMD can cause rapid vision loss
- Wet AMD is treated with eye injections that are very effective
- Smoking is the biggest risk factor you can control

### Level 2: Types and Symptoms
- Dry AMD: drusen accumulation, gradual atrophy, 85-90% of cases
- Wet AMD: abnormal leaky blood vessels, 10-15% of cases but more severe
- Watch for wavy lines (metamorphopsia) - sign of possible wet AMD
- Use an Amsler grid at home to monitor vision

### Level 3: Diagnosis and Treatment Details
- OCT imaging is critical for diagnosis and monitoring
- AREDS2 supplements may slow progression in intermediate dry AMD
- Anti-VEGF injections block vessel growth in wet AMD
- Treatment is ongoing, often indefinitely

### Level 4: Management and Prognosis
- Wet AMD: 95% maintain vision with treatment; 30-40% improve
- Geographic atrophy: new complement inhibitors can slow progression
- Low vision rehabilitation helps maximize remaining function
- Dry can convert to wet at any time - report changes immediately

### Level 5: Complexities and Special Considerations
- Genetic factors (CFH, ARMS2) influence risk and may affect treatment response
