      summary: 'Home exercises are an essential part of your recovery. The exercises your physical therapist gives you to do at home are just as important as the treatment you receive in the clinic.',
      explanation: `Your physical therapist sees you a few times a week, but healing happens 24/7. Home exercises fill the gaps between visits and are key to your success.

**Why Home Exercises Matter:**
- You heal between PT visits, not just during them
- Consistency builds strength and flexibility
- Maintains progress between sessions
- Prevents stiffness and weakness
- Gets you better faster

**Making Time for Exercises:**
- Most programs take 15-30 minutes
- Pick a consistent time each day
- Morning, lunch break, or evening - whatever works for you
- Can break into shorter sessions if needed

**Tips for Success:**

*Getting started:*
- Set up a specific spot for exercises
- Keep equipment ready (if needed)
- Set a daily reminder
- Start with a few exercises, add more gradually

*During exercises:*
- Follow instructions carefully
- Focus on quality, not just quantity
- Some discomfort is okay; sharp pain is not
- Breathe normally throughout

*Staying motivated:*
- Track your completion (simple checklist works)
- Notice small improvements
- Tell someone about your goals
- Reward yourself for consistency

**Common Questions:**

*"How do I know if I'm doing them right?"*
- Ask your PT to watch you at your next visit
- Take notes or photos of correct positions
- If something causes sharp pain, stop and ask

*"What if I miss a day?"*
- Don't double up the next day
- Just get back on track
- Occasional misses are okay; pattern of misses is a problem

*"Should I do more if I feel good?"*
- Stick to the prescribed program
- More is not always better
- Talk to your PT before adding exercises

**When to Contact Your Therapist:**
- Exercises cause significant pain
- Symptoms getting worse
- Confused about instructions
- Want to progress faster`,
