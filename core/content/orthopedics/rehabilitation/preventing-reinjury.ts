      summary: 'After recovering from an injury, taking steps to prevent it from happening again is just as important as the initial recovery. Simple habits can significantly reduce your risk.',
      explanation: `Once you have had an injury, you are at higher risk of getting hurt again. But the good news is that there is a lot you can do to protect yourself.

**Why Reinjury Happens:**
- Returning to activity too soon
- Not fully completing rehabilitation
- Weak muscles that were not fully rebuilt
- Fear that changes how you move
- Not continuing maintenance exercises

**Keys to Prevention:**

*Complete Your Rehabilitation:*
- Finish all your physical therapy
- Don't stop when you "feel better"
- Meet all return-to-activity criteria
- Build strength back to normal

*Continue Exercises After Discharge:*
- Keep doing a maintenance program
- Usually 15-20 minutes, 2-3 times per week
- Focus on strength and flexibility
- Include balance exercises

*Warm Up Before Activity:*
- Never skip the warm-up
- At least 10 minutes before sports
- Include dynamic movements
- Practice sport-specific motions

*Listen to Your Body:*
- Don't push through pain
- Rest when tired
- Fatigue increases injury risk
- Take breaks during long activities

*Use Proper Technique:*
- Get coaching if needed
- Focus on form over speed or weight
- Correct bad habits
- Video yourself if helpful

**Sport-Specific Tips:**

*Running:*
- Gradual mileage increases (10% rule)
- Replace shoes regularly
- Cross-train
- Strength train

*Court Sports (basketball, tennis):*
- Ankle support or taping if needed
- Warm up before playing
- Balance and agility exercises

*Weightlifting:*
