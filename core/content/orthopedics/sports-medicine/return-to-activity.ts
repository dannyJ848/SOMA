      summary: 'Returning to sports or exercise after an injury takes patience. Going back too soon can lead to re-injury, but with proper steps, you can get back safely.',
      explanation: `After an injury, it is natural to want to get back to your activities quickly. But rushing can make things worse. Here is how to return safely.

**Signs You Are Ready:**
- Pain is gone or minimal
- Swelling has resolved
- You have full range of motion
- Strength is back to normal
- You can do basic movements without problems

**The Gradual Return:**

*Step 1: Basic Movement*
- Walking without pain
- Light stretching
- Simple exercises

*Step 2: Light Activity*
- Easy jogging or cycling
- Basic sport movements at low intensity
- Building up endurance

*Step 3: Sport-Specific Training*
- Practice drills
- Sport movements at moderate intensity
- No contact or competition yet

*Step 4: Full Return*
- Practice with team
- Gradual return to games/competition
- Start with limited playing time

**Warning Signs to Stop:**
- Return of pain or swelling
- Joint feels unstable or gives way
- Significant soreness after activity
- Favoring or protecting the injured area

**Tips for Success:**
- Follow your doctor or physical therapist's advice
- Don't skip steps even if you feel good
- Communicate with coaches about your status
- Be patient - proper healing takes time
- Warm up thoroughly before activity

**Mental Readiness:**
- Feeling confident in the injured area
- Not afraid of movements that caused injury
- Focused and not distracted by worry
- Ready to give full effort

**When in Doubt:**
- Ask your healthcare provider
- Better to wait an extra week than re-injure
- Listen to your body`,
