      summary: 'A care planning conference is a special meeting where you, your family, and your healthcare team talk together about your care and make plans.',
      explanation: `**What Is a Care Planning Conference?**

A care planning conference is a meeting where:
- You (the patient)
- Your family members
- Your doctors, nurses, and other healthcare team members

All come together to talk about your care and make plans together.

**Why Have These Meetings?**

- Everyone hears the same information at the same time
- Family can ask questions directly
- You can make decisions together
- Everyone agrees on the plan
- Less confusion about care

**What Happens During the Meeting?**

1. **Introduction**: Everyone meets each other
2. **Update**: Your doctor shares how you are doing
3. **Discussion**: You talk about what matters most to you
4. **Planning**: Together, you make a care plan
5. **Summary**: The plan is written down and shared

**Who Should Come?**

- You (the patient) - most important!
- Family members who help with decisions
- Your main doctor
- Nurses who know you well
- Others who help with your care (social worker, chaplain, therapist)

**How Long Do They Last?**

Most meetings last 30-60 minutes, but they can be shorter or longer depending on what needs to be discussed.

**Can We Have More Than One Meeting?**

Yes! You can have care planning conferences:
- When your health changes
- When big decisions need to be made
- When family members disagree
- Whenever you or your team thinks it would help`,
