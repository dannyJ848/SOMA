# Symptom Management in Palliative Care

## Overview
Symptom management is a cornerstone of palliative care. Serious illness often brings multiple symptoms that affect quality of life, including pain, nausea, shortness of breath, fatigue, anxiety, depression, constipation, and loss of appetite. Effective symptom management requires careful assessment, understanding of underlying causes, and individualized treatment approaches that consider the whole person.

## Pain Management

### Level 1: Foundation
Pain is one of the most feared symptoms in serious illness. The good news is that most pain can be controlled.

**Key points about pain:**
- Tell your healthcare team about your pain - they cannot help if they do not know
- Pain medications work best when taken regularly, not just when pain is severe
- There are many types of pain medications for different types of pain
- Becoming addicted is rare when pain medications are used properly for real pain

**Pain rating scale:**
0 = No pain
1-3 = Mild (annoying but manageable)
4-6 = Moderate (interferes with activities)
7-10 = Severe (hard to think or do anything)

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Types of pain in serious illness:**

| Type | Characteristics | Common Causes | Typical Treatment |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Nociceptive - Somatic | Aching, throbbing, localized | Bone metastases, surgery | NSAIDs, opioids |
| Nociceptive - Visceral | Deep, squeezing, cramping | Organ involvement | Opioids, antispasmodics |
| Neuropathic | Burning, shooting, tingling | Nerve damage, chemo | Gabapentin, duloxetine |
| Mixed | Combination features | Advanced cancer | Combination therapy |

**Pain assessment:**
- Location: Where does it hurt?
- Quality: What does it feel like?
- Intensity: How bad (0-10)?
- Timing: Constant or intermittent?
- Aggravating/relieving factors: What makes it better or worse?
- Impact: How does it affect your life?

**WHO Pain Ladder (modified for palliative care):**
1. Mild pain: Non-opioids (acetaminophen, NSAIDs)
2. Moderate pain: Low-dose strong opioids or weak opioids
3. Severe pain: Strong opioids (morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl)
4. Adjuvants: Added at any step for specific pain types

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Opioid basics:**

**Starting opioids:**
- Begin with short-acting formulation
- Use lowest effective dose
- Assess and adjust every 24-48 hours
- Convert to long-acting once stable dose identified
- Always provide breakthrough medication

**Common opioids in palliative care:**

| Opioid | Route | Starting Dose | Notes |
|--------|-------|---------------|-------|
| Morphine | PO | 5-15 mg q4h | First-line, avoid in renal failure |
| Oxycodone | PO | 5-10 mg q4-6h | Alternative to morphine |
| Hydromorphone | PO/IV | 2-4 mg PO q4h | Preferred in renal impairment |
| Fentanyl | Patch | 12-25 mcg/hr | For stable, chronic pain only |
| Methadone | PO | Specialist consultation | Complex pharmacology |

**Opioid side effects management:**
- Constipation: Always prescribe laxatives prophylactically
- Nausea: Usually temporary, treat with antiemetics
- Sedation: Usually improves after few days
- Confusion: May need dose adjustment or opioid rotation
- Respiratory depression: Rare with appropriate dosing

**Breakthrough pain:**
- Give 10-15% of total daily opioid dose
- Short-acting formulation
- Available every 1-2 hours as needed
- Document frequency of use to guide dose adjustments

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Adjuvant analgesics:**

**For neuropathic pain:**
- Gabapentin: Start 100-300 mg at bedtime, titrate to 900-3600 mg/day
- Pregabalin: Start 25-75 mg BID, titrate to 150-600 mg/day
- Duloxetine: Start 30 mg daily, increase to 60 mg
- Tricyclic antidepressants: Nortriptyline/amitriptyline 10-75 mg at bedtime

**For bone pain:**
- NSAIDs if not contraindicated
- Corticosteroids for acute flares
- Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid)
- Radiation therapy (often very effective)
- Radiopharmaceuticals for diffuse bone metastases

**For bowel obstruction pain:**
- Octreotide (reduces secretions)
- Hyoscine butylbromide (antispasmodic)
- Steroids (reduce edema)

**Opioid rotation:**
When to consider:
- Inadequate pain relief despite dose escalation
- Intolerable side effects
- Renal impairment
- Route change needed

Conversion principles:
- Calculate equianalgesic dose
- Reduce by 25-50% for incomplete cross-tolerance
- Adjust based on clinical situation

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Complex pain syndromes:**

**Cancer-induced bone pain:**
- Unique pathophysiology
- Responds to NSAIDs + opioids
- Radiation highly effective
- Bisphosphonates reduce skeletal events
- May need interventional procedures

**Malignant bowel obstruction:**
- Medical management often preferable to surgery
- Opioids for pain
- Antiemetics and antisecretory agents
- Consider venting gastrostomy

**Refractory pain:**
Options when standard approaches fail:
- Intrathecal drug delivery
- Nerve blocks
- Neurolytic procedures
- Palliative sedation (in extreme cases)

**Total pain concept (Cicely Saunders):**
Pain is not just physical - includes emotional, social, and spiritual components:
- Addressing anxiety and depression
- Social support and meaning
- Spiritual care and existential concerns
- Holistic approach essential

## Nausea and Vomiting

### Level 1: Foundation
Nausea (feeling sick to your stomach) and vomiting are common and very distressing. Many effective treatments are available.

**What helps:**
- Take anti-nausea medication regularly, not just when you feel sick
- Small, frequent meals
- Avoid strong smells
- Cool, clear fluids
- Rest after eating (but stay upright)

**Tell your healthcare team:**
- How often you feel nauseated
- How often you vomit
- What seems to trigger it
- What you have tried

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Causes of nausea in serious illness:**

| Cause | Mechanism | Examples |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Medications | Direct effect on brain or stomach | Opioids, chemotherapy |
| Gut problems | Slowed emptying, obstruction | Constipation, tumor |
| Chemical | Blood chemistry changes | Kidney failure, high calcium |
| Brain | Increased pressure, anxiety | Brain tumors, anxiety |

**First-line antiemetics:**

| Medication | When to Use | Dose |
|------------|-------------|------|
| Ondansetron | Chemotherapy, general | 4-8 mg PO/IV q8h |
| Metoclopramide | Slow stomach emptying | 10 mg PO/IV before meals |
| Prochlorperazine | General nausea | 10 mg PO/IV q6h |
| Haloperidol | Opioid-induced, metabolic | 0.5-2 mg PO/IV q6h |

**Non-medication approaches:**
- Ginger (tea, candies, supplements)
- Acupressure wristbands
- Deep breathing
- Cool environment
- Avoiding triggers

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Cause-directed treatment:**

**Opioid-induced nausea:**
- Usually improves after 3-5 days
- Haloperidol 0.5-1 mg BID
- Metoclopramide if gastroparesis suspected
- Consider opioid rotation if persistent

**Chemotherapy-induced:**
- Follow established antiemetic protocols
- Prevention is key
- Combination regimens most effective
- Anticipatory nausea responds to benzodiazepines

**Bowel obstruction:**
- Octreotide to reduce secretions
- Haloperidol for nausea
- Consider NG tube if vomiting large volumes
- Corticosteroids may reduce edema

**Increased intracranial pressure:**
- Dexamethasone 8-16 mg daily
- Often dramatic response
- Antiemetics may help symptoms

**Metabolic (high calcium, uremia):**
- Treat underlying cause when possible
- Haloperidol effective
- Ondansetron may help

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Pathophysiology of nausea:**

Four main pathways:
1. **Chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ)**: Responds to blood-borne toxins
   - Opioids, chemotherapy, uremia
   - Treated with: Haloperidol, ondansetron
2. **Vestibular**: Motion, ear problems
   - Treated with: Meclizine, scopolamine
3. **GI tract**: Distension, obstruction, irritation
   - Treated with: Metoclopramide (prokinetic)
4. **Cortical**: Anxiety, anticipation, increased ICP
   - Treated with: Benzodiazepines, steroids

**Receptor-based treatment:**

| Receptor | Antiemetic |
|----------|------------|
| Dopamine D2 | Haloperidol, metoclopramide, prochlorperazine |
| Serotonin 5-HT3 | Ondansetron, granisetron |
| Histamine H1 | Diphenhydramine, meclizine |
| Muscarinic | Scopolamine |
| NK-1 | Aprepitant |

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Refractory nausea:**

When standard approaches fail:
- Re-assess for correctable causes
- Try different receptor class
- Combination antiemetics
- Olanzapine (broad receptor profile) 2.5-5 mg daily
- Dexamethasone 4-8 mg as adjunct
- Consider cannabinoids (dronabinol, nabilone)
- Subcutaneous antiemetic infusions

**Malignant bowel obstruction management:**
- Often multifactorial
- Goals: Minimize vomiting, control pain, maintain oral intake if possible
- Medical: Octreotide + haloperidol + dexamethasone
- Venting gastrostomy if medical management fails
- Surgery rarely indicated in advanced disease

## Shortness of Breath (Dyspnea)

### Level 1: Foundation
Shortness of breath, also called dyspnea, is feeling like you cannot get enough air. This is very common and very distressing in serious illness.

**What may help:**
- A fan blowing cool air on your face
- Sitting upright or leaning forward
- Staying calm and using slow breaths
- Medications prescribed by your doctor
- Oxygen (if your oxygen levels are low)

**Tell your healthcare team:**
- How often you feel short of breath
- What makes it worse or better
- How it affects your activities
- Whether it is getting worse

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Causes of dyspnea in serious illness:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Lung disease | COPD, cancer, fibrosis, effusion |
| Heart disease | Heart failure, pericardial effusion |
| Anemia | Cancer-related, bleeding |
| Weak muscles | Debility, neuromuscular disease |
| Anxiety | Panic, fear |
| Other | Ascites, obesity |

**Treatment approaches:**

**Non-medication:**
- Fan or cool air on face (stimulates trigeminal nerve)
- Positioning (upright, leaning forward)
- Energy conservation techniques
- Relaxation and breathing techniques
- Reduce anxiety triggers

**Medications:**
| Medication | How It Helps | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Opioids | Reduce sensation of breathlessness | Most effective treatment |
| Oxygen | Helpful if oxygen levels low | May not help if levels normal |
| Benzodiazepines | Reduce anxiety component | Use cautiously |
| Bronchodilators | Open airways | For bronchospasm |
| Steroids | Reduce inflammation | For COPD, lymphangitis |

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Opioids for dyspnea:**
Evidence-based and effective:
- Start low: Morphine 2.5-5 mg PO q4h or as needed
- Nebulized morphine not more effective than oral
- Regular dosing may be better than as-needed
- Does not hasten death when used appropriately
- Titrate to comfort

**Oxygen therapy:**
- Indicated if hypoxic (SpO2 <90%)
- If not hypoxic, fan may work as well
- Palliative oxygen for comfort even if not hypoxic is controversial
- Weigh burden of equipment against benefit
- N-of-1 trial: Try oxygen vs. medical air

**Dyspnea crisis:**
Acute severe breathlessness:
- Stay calm, reassure patient
- Position upright
- Fan on face
- Opioid (IV/SC if severe)
- Benzodiazepine if significant anxiety
- Rule out treatable causes (PE, pneumothorax)

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Pathophysiology:**
Dyspnea results from mismatch between respiratory drive and capacity:
- Increased work of breathing
- Hypoxia or hypercapnia
- Increased respiratory drive
- Respiratory muscle weakness
- Psychological factors

**Why opioids work:**
- Reduce ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia
- Decrease central perception of breathlessness
- Reduce anxiety
- Relax respiratory muscles
- Safe in appropriate doses

**Disease-specific approaches:**

| Disease | Treatment Focus |
|---------|-----------------|
| COPD | Bronchodilators, steroids, opioids |
| Lung cancer | Opioids, pleural drainage if effusion |
| Heart failure | Diuretics, opioids |
| Pulmonary fibrosis | Opioids, oxygen |
| Lymphangitic carcinomatosis | Steroids, opioids |

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Refractory dyspnea:**

When standard measures insufficient:
- Re-evaluate for treatable causes
- Optimize underlying disease treatment
- Increase opioid dose
- Add benzodiazepine for anxiety component
- Consider nebulized furosemide (experimental)
- Palliative sedation in terminal phase if refractory

**End-of-life dyspnea:**
- Very common symptom in final hours/days
- Opioids remain cornerstone
- May need continuous infusion
- Glycopyrrolate or hyoscine for secretions (death rattle)
- Family education about normal respiratory changes

**Non-invasive ventilation (NIV):**
- Can provide comfort in selected patients
- Useful bridge in potentially reversible situations
- Ethical considerations about when to discontinue
- Not for comfort in actively dying patients

## Fatigue

### Level 1: Foundation
Fatigue in serious illness is much more than just being tired. It is an overwhelming sense of exhaustion that does not improve with rest.

**What may help:**
- Pace yourself - rest before you are exhausted
- Save energy for what matters most to you
- Short naps (not too long or too late in day)
- Light exercise if you are able
- Treat other symptoms (pain, nausea) that worsen fatigue

**Important:** Fatigue is real and common. You are not being lazy.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Causes of fatigue in serious illness:**

| Cause | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| The illness itself | Cancer, heart failure, kidney disease |
| Treatment | Chemotherapy, radiation, surgery |
| Anemia | Low red blood cells |
| Infection | Underlying or active infections |
| Nutrition | Poor appetite, weight loss |
| Sleep problems | Insomnia, apnea |
| Medications | Opioids, sedatives |
| Emotional | Depression, anxiety |

**Assessment questions:**
- How severe is your fatigue (0-10)?
- How does it affect your daily activities?
- Is it constant or does it vary?
- What makes it better or worse?
- How well are you sleeping?
- How is your mood?

**Management strategies:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Energy conservation | Prioritize activities, pace yourself, plan rest |
| Physical activity | Light exercise, maintain mobility |
| Treat treatable causes | Anemia, infection, depression |
| Medications | Stimulants in selected cases |
| Psychological support | Address emotional contributors |

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Treatable causes to identify:**

**Anemia:**
- Check hemoglobin
- Consider transfusion if symptomatic and goals consistent
- Erythropoietin-stimulating agents in limited situations

**Depression:**
- Screen for depression
- Treat if present - can dramatically improve fatigue
- Consider activating antidepressants (bupropion, methylphenidate)

**Hypothyroidism:**
- Check thyroid function
- Easy to treat if present

**Medication review:**
- Reduce sedating medications if possible
- Simplify medication regimens
- Review timing of medications

**Infection:**
- Chronic or occult infections can cause fatigue
- Consider evaluation based on clinical picture

**Pharmacological options:**
| Medication | Evidence | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Methylphenidate | Moderate | Start 5 mg AM and noon, max 40 mg/day |
| Modafinil | Limited | 100-200 mg AM |
| Dexamethasone | Short-term benefit | 4 mg daily, limited duration |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Cancer-related fatigue:**
The most common symptom in cancer patients:
- Affects 60-90% of cancer patients
- Multifactorial etiology
- Often undertreated
- Correlates with inflammation markers

**Pathophysiology theories:**
- Cytokine dysregulation (IL-1, IL-6, TNF)
- Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis disruption
- Circadian rhythm disruption
- Muscle metabolism changes
- Anemia and cachexia

**Evidence-based interventions:**
- Exercise: Best evidence overall
- Psychosocial interventions: Cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness
- Pharmacological: Limited but some benefit from stimulants
- Complementary: Acupuncture, yoga (some evidence)

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Cachexia-anorexia syndrome:**
Overlaps significantly with fatigue:
- Weight loss, muscle wasting, weakness
- Metabolic changes driven by inflammation
- Limited response to nutrition alone
- Multimodal management needed

**Refractory fatigue:**
When fatigue does not improve:
- Accept limitations
- Focus on what patient can do
- Address meaning and quality of life
- Support adaptation
- Optimize other symptoms
- Consider occupational therapy for energy conservation

**Research directions:**
- Anti-inflammatory approaches
- Targeted cytokine therapies
- Exercise interventions
- Better understanding of mechanisms
- Fatigue biomarkers

## Anxiety and Depression

### Level 1: Foundation
Feeling anxious or sad when you have a serious illness is normal. But sometimes these feelings become so strong that they need treatment.

**Signs that may need attention:**
- Feeling hopeless or worthless
- No interest in things you used to enjoy
- Unable to stop worrying
- Physical symptoms from anxiety (racing heart, sweating)
- Thoughts of suicide or self-harm (seek help immediately)

**What helps:**
- Talk to someone about how you are feeling
- Counseling or therapy
- Medications can help
- Support groups
- Staying connected with people you care about

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Distinguishing normal distress from disorders:**

| Normal Response | May Need Treatment |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Periodic sadness | Persistent hopelessness |
| Worry about future | Constant, uncontrollable anxiety |
| Some days better than others | No good days |
| Can still enjoy some things | No pleasure in anything |
| Keeps appointments and treatments | Withdrawing from care |

**Screening tools:**
- PHQ-2/PHQ-9: Depression screening
- GAD-7: Anxiety screening
- Distress Thermometer: Overall distress

**Depression symptoms in serious illness:**
- Anhedonia (loss of pleasure) - more reliable than sadness
- Hopelessness
- Worthlessness or excessive guilt
- Thoughts of death (beyond acceptance)
- Difficulty concentrating
- Sleep disturbance
- Appetite changes

**Note:** Physical symptoms like fatigue and appetite loss may be from illness, not depression. Focus on psychological symptoms.

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Treatment of depression:**

**Psychotherapy:**
- Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
- Supportive counseling
- Meaning-centered psychotherapy
- Dignity therapy

**Medications:**

| Medication | Starting Dose | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| Sertraline | 25-50 mg daily | First-line SSRI |
| Citalopram | 10-20 mg daily | Fewer interactions |
| Mirtazapine | 7.5-15 mg at bedtime | Helps sleep and appetite |
| Methylphenidate | 5 mg BID | Rapid onset, useful if prognosis limited |

**Treatment of anxiety:**

**Non-pharmacological:**
- Relaxation training
- Breathing exercises
- Mindfulness
- Counseling

**Medications:**

| Medication | Use | Dose |
|------------|-----|------|
| Lorazepam | Acute anxiety | 0.5-1 mg q6-8h PRN |
| Buspirone | Chronic anxiety | 5-10 mg TID |
| SSRI/SNRI | Generalized anxiety | Standard antidepressant doses |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Depression in advanced illness:**

**Challenges:**
- Symptom overlap with illness
- Limited time for antidepressants to work (4-6 weeks)
- Drug interactions
- Prognosis considerations

**Rapid-acting options for limited prognosis:**
- Psychostimulants (methylphenidate, modafinil)
- Ketamine (emerging evidence)
- Psychotherapy can help quickly
- Mirtazapine may have faster onset

**Desire for hastened death:**
- May indicate depression or poorly controlled symptoms
- Requires careful assessment
- Often improves with treatment of depression and symptoms
- Does not always indicate depression

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Existential distress:**

Different from clinical depression:
- Loss of meaning and purpose
- Disconnection from others
- Feeling of being a burden
- Loss of dignity
- Spiritual distress

**Approaches:**
- Meaning-centered psychotherapy
- Dignity therapy (life review creating legacy document)
- Chaplaincy and spiritual care
- Addressing specific concerns (burden, isolation)
- Existential suffering may not respond to antidepressants

**Demoralization syndrome:**
- Distinct from depression
- Loss of meaning, not necessarily pleasure
- Hopelessness about future
- May respond to meaning-focused interventions

**Complicated grief (in caregivers):**
- Intense grief lasting beyond typical duration
- Difficulty accepting death
- Impaired functioning
- May need specialized treatment

---

## Constipation

### Level 1: Foundation
Constipation (difficulty having bowel movements) is very common in serious illness. It can cause significant discomfort, but it is treatable.

**Common causes:**
- Pain medications (especially opioids)
- Other medications
- Less activity
- Less food and fluid intake
- The illness itself

**What helps:**
- Take laxatives as prescribed (especially if on opioids)
- Drink fluids if you can
- Move around if possible
- Do not wait too long to treat constipation

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Causes in palliative care:**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Medications | Opioids, anticholinergics, iron, ondansetron |
| Reduced intake | Less food, fiber, fluids |
| Reduced mobility | Weakness, bedbound |
| Disease-related | Bowel obstruction, spinal cord compression |
| Metabolic | Low potassium, high calcium |

**Laxative types:**

| Type | How It Works | Examples |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Stimulant | Makes bowel contract | Senna, bisacodyl |
| Osmotic | Draws water into bowel | Polyethylene glycol, lactulose |
| Softener | Softens stool | Docusate (alone not very effective) |
| Prokinetic | Speeds bowel movement | Prucalopride |

**Basic principles:**
- Prevent rather than treat
- Start laxatives when starting opioids
- Combination often needed (stimulant + osmotic)
- Titrate to bowel movements every 1-2 days

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Opioid-induced constipation:**
- Nearly universal with opioid use
- Tolerance does NOT develop (unlike other side effects)
- Requires prevention from day one

**Bowel regimen for opioid users:**
1. Start with senna 2 tablets at bedtime
2. Add polyethylene glycol 17g daily if needed
3. Titrate up as needed
4. Goal: Comfortable bowel movement every 1-2 days

**Assessment:**
- When was last bowel movement?
- What is normal for you?
- Any abdominal pain or bloating?
- Nausea or vomiting?
- Feel like you need to go but cannot?

**Red flags:**
- No BM in >3 days plus nausea/vomiting
- Severe abdominal pain
- Abdominal distension
- Fecal vomiting
- May indicate obstruction - needs evaluation

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Refractory constipation:**

If standard laxatives not working:
- Rule out impaction (may need manual disimpaction)
- Rule out obstruction
- Consider methylnaltrexone (PAMORA) for opioid-induced
- May need enemas or suppositories

**PAMORAs (Peripherally Acting Mu-Opioid Receptor Antagonists):**
- Methylnaltrexone (Relistor): SC injection
- Naldemedine (Symproic): Oral
- Naloxegol (Movantik): Oral
- Block opioid receptors in gut only
- Do not reverse pain relief
- Effective for opioid-induced constipation

**Fecal impaction:**
- Hard stool in rectum that cannot pass
- May need enema, suppository, or manual removal
- Consider after 3+ days without BM
- Assess with rectal exam

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Complex scenarios:**

**Malignant bowel obstruction:**
- Constipation may be presenting symptom
- Medical vs. surgical management decisions
- May need NG decompression
- Consider venting gastrostomy
- Medical: Octreotide, steroids, antiemetics

**Neurogenic bowel:**
- Spinal cord compression or disease
- Scheduled stimulant laxatives essential
- May need regular suppositories or enemas
- Digital stimulation for some patients

**End-of-life constipation:**
- Continue bowel care until death approaches
- May need to scale back as intake decreases
- Impaction can cause significant distress
- Balance interventions with comfort

---

## Loss of Appetite and Weight Loss

### Level 1: Foundation
Loss of appetite is very common with serious illness. It can be distressing for you and your family.

**Understanding:**
- Loss of appetite is part of the illness, not your fault
- Forcing yourself to eat often makes you feel worse
- Small amounts of favorite foods are fine
- Pleasure in food matters more than nutrition in advanced illness

**What may help:**
- Small, frequent meals
- Eat your favorite foods
- Cool or room temperature foods may be easier
- Do not force yourself
- Accept that appetite may not return to normal

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Causes of poor appetite:**

| Cause | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| The illness itself | Cancer, heart failure, COPD |
| Symptoms | Nausea, pain, constipation, mouth sores |
| Treatment effects | Chemotherapy, radiation |
| Emotional | Depression, anxiety |
| Medications | Opioids, chemotherapy |
| Metabolic changes | Cachexia syndrome |

**Cachexia vs. simple starvation:**
| Feature | Starvation | Cachexia |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Cause | Lack of food | Disease-related |
| Response to nutrition | Improves | Limited improvement |
| What is lost | Fat first | Muscle and fat |
| Inflammation | No | Yes |
| Reversible | Yes | Partially at best |

**Practical approaches:**
- Address treatable symptoms (nausea, constipation, pain)
- Treat depression if present
- Optimize meal timing with medications
- Small, calorie-dense portions
- Favorite foods and comfort foods
- Social aspects of eating when possible

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Medical evaluation:**
- Rule out treatable causes
- Assess for constipation, nausea, thrush, depression
- Review medications
- Assess for early satiety (gastroparesis)

**Pharmacological options:**

| Medication | How It Helps | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-------|
| Megestrol (Megace) | Increases appetite | Risk of blood clots |
| Dexamethasone | Short-term appetite boost | 2-4 mg daily, time-limited use |
| Mirtazapine | Helps appetite and sleep | Also antidepressant |
| Dronabinol | Stimulates appetite | Cannabinoid |

**Artificial nutrition decisions:**

When to consider tube feeding or IV nutrition:
- Will it meet patient's goals?
- Is the underlying cause reversible?
- What are burdens vs. benefits?
- Does patient want it?

In advanced illness:
- Often does not improve quality of life or survival
- Can cause complications
- May not align with comfort-focused goals
- Family education essential

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Cancer cachexia syndrome:**
A complex metabolic syndrome:
- Driven by tumor-host interaction
- Inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha)
- Muscle wasting (skeletal and cardiac)
- Altered metabolism
- Poor prognosis indicator

**Multimodal treatment:**
- Nutrition support (limited impact alone)
- Exercise when possible
- Anti-inflammatory approaches (omega-3)
- Pharmacotherapy
- Treatment of underlying disease

**Evidence for appetite stimulants:**
- Megestrol: Increases appetite and weight (mostly fluid)
- Corticosteroids: Short-term benefit only
- Cannabinoids: Modest benefit
- None shown to improve survival or function

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Family dynamics around eating:**

Feeding has profound emotional meaning:
- Families feel helpless watching loved ones not eat
- Food = caring in many cultures
- Conflicts can arise around eating
- Education and support essential
- "Allowing not to eat" can feel like giving up

**Counseling families:**
- Loss of appetite is the illness, not a choice
- Forcing food causes discomfort
- Body cannot use nutrition in same way
- Small amounts of enjoyed foods are fine
- Being together matters more than eating

**Approaching the end of life:**
- Natural decrease in appetite as death nears
- Dehydration in dying can be comfortable
- IV fluids can increase secretions, edema, discomfort
- Family education about natural dying process
- Focus on oral care and comfort

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Pain is controllable** - Most pain can be well managed with proper assessment and treatment
2. **Opioids are safe** - When used appropriately, they are effective and do not hasten death
3. **Treat nausea by cause** - Identify the mechanism to choose the right antiemetic
4. **Opioids help breathlessness** - They are the most effective treatment for dyspnea
5. **Fatigue is real** - Energy conservation and treating underlying causes help most
6. **Screen for depression** - It is common, treatable, and affects quality of life
7. **Prevent constipation** - Start laxatives when starting opioids
8. **Respect appetite loss** - Forcing nutrition in advanced illness often causes more harm than good

---

## Summary

Symptom management is essential in palliative care. Pain can be effectively controlled using the WHO ladder approach, with opioids safe and effective when used appropriately. Nausea should be treated based on the underlying cause and mechanism. Dyspnea responds well to opioids, which reduce the sensation of breathlessness. Fatigue requires addressing treatable causes and energy conservation. Anxiety and depression need recognition and treatment, with rapid-acting options available for those with limited prognosis. Constipation requires prevention, especially with opioid use. Loss of appetite is common and often reflects the disease process; forcing nutrition rarely helps and can cause distress. Throughout, the focus should be on quality of life and what matters most to the patient.
