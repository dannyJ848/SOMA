## Writing Down Your Symptoms

### Complexity Level 1 (Ages 5-8)
When something hurts or feels weird in your body, it's important to tell the doctor. Before you go, you can draw a picture of where it hurts! Use a big picture of a body and color the spot that doesn't feel good. You can also draw faces to show how much it hurts - a tiny frown for a little pain, or a big frown for a lot of pain.

Think about these questions:
- Where does it hurt?
- When did it start hurting?
- Does it hurt all the time or just sometimes?
- Does anything make it feel better?

**Parent Tip**: Help your child describe their symptoms using words they know. "Does it feel like an owie? Like something is poking you? Like it's too hot?"

---

### Complexity Level 2 (Ages 9-12)
Keeping track of how you feel before a doctor's visit is like being a detective about your own body. Get a notebook or use a notes app on a phone to write down:

**The Basics**:
- What feels wrong? (pain, tiredness, upset stomach, etc.)
- Where in your body do you feel it?
- When did it start? (try to remember the exact day)
- How often does it happen?

**Be Specific**:
- Rate your pain from 1-10 (1 is barely noticeable, 10 is the worst pain ever)
- Describe what it feels like: sharp, dull, burning, aching, throbbing
- What makes it worse? What makes it better?
- Does it affect your activities? (Can't play sports, trouble sleeping, etc.)

**Symptom Diary Example**:
| Date | Symptom | How Bad (1-10) | What I Was Doing | How Long It Lasted |
|------|---------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Monday | Headache | 6 | After soccer practice | 2 hours |
| Wednesday | Headache | 4 | After school | 1 hour |

---

### Complexity Level 3 (Ages 13-17)
Effective symptom documentation requires systematic observation and honest reporting. Your healthcare provider relies on accurate information to diagnose and treat you properly.

**Creating a Comprehensive Symptom Log**:

1. **Primary Symptoms**
   - Describe the main problem in your own words
   - Note when symptoms first appeared
   - Track frequency (constant, intermittent, daily, weekly)
   - Record duration of each episode

2. **Symptom Characteristics**
   - Quality: sharp, dull, burning, aching, pressure, cramping
   - Intensity: use a 0-10 scale consistently
   - Location: be as specific as possible (upper right abdomen, behind left eye)
   - Radiation: does the symptom spread or move?

3. **Modifying Factors**
   - What triggers or worsens symptoms?
   - What provides relief?
   - Time of day patterns
   - Relationship to eating, sleeping, activity, stress

4. **Associated Symptoms**
   - Other things happening at the same time
   - Symptoms that come before or after the main problem

5. **Functional Impact**
   - Effects on school performance
   - Impact on sports, hobbies, social activities
   - Sleep disruption
   - Mood changes

**Sample Symptom Journal Format**:
```
Date/Time: [When it happened]
Symptom: [What you felt]
Severity: [1-10 scale]
Duration: [How long]
What I was doing: [Activity at the time]
What helped/hurt: [Modifying factors]
Other symptoms: [Anything else I noticed]
```

### Complexity Level 4 (Ages 18+ General Adult)
Thorough symptom documentation significantly improves diagnostic accuracy and helps you communicate efficiently during time-limited appointments.

**Systematic Symptom Documentation Framework**:

**1. Chief Complaint Preparation**
Identify and prioritize your main concerns. If you have multiple issues, rank them by importance or severity. Be prepared to lead with your most pressing concern.

**2. Symptom Characterization (OLDCARTS Method)**
- **O**nset: When did it start? Sudden or gradual?
- **L**ocation: Precisely where? Does it radiate?
- **D**uration: How long does each episode last? Total duration of the problem?
- **C**haracterization: What does it feel like? (Use descriptive terms)
- **A**ggravating factors: What makes it worse?
- **R**elieving factors: What helps?
- **T**iming: Constant or intermittent? Pattern throughout the day?
- **S**everity: Consistent 0-10 scale rating

**3. Timeline Construction**
Create a clear chronological narrative:
- First occurrence of symptoms
- Progression or changes over time
- Previous episodes of similar problems
- Treatments tried and their effects

**4. Context Documentation**
- Life changes around symptom onset (new job, stress, travel, diet changes)
- Environmental factors
- Recent illnesses or exposures
- Family members with similar symptoms

**5. Functional Assessment**
Quantify how symptoms affect daily life:

---

### Complexity Level 5 (Advanced/Medical Professional)
Effective patient preparation for clinical encounters requires structured documentation that facilitates efficient history-taking and supports clinical decision-making.

**Clinical Documentation Standards**:

**Chief Complaint Formulation**
Prepare a concise statement of the primary concern in patient-centered language while noting duration. This should be communicable in one sentence while capturing the essence of the presenting problem.

**History of Present Illness (HPI) Preparation**
Structure symptom reporting to align with standard medical documentation:

1. **Temporal Characteristics**
   - Onset: acute, subacute, or chronic; sudden vs. gradual
   - Duration: episodic vs. continuous; total illness duration
   - Frequency: paroxysmal patterns, circadian variations
   - Progression: stable, worsening, improving, waxing/waning

2. **Qualitative Descriptors**
   - Character: utilize standard clinical descriptors (pleuritic, colicky, lancinating, etc.)
   - Severity: validated pain scales when applicable (VAS, NRS, faces scale)
   - Location: anatomical precision with radiation patterns

3. **Modifying Factors**
   - Provocative: activities, positions, exposures, foods, medications
   - Palliative: rest, medications, positions, therapies tried
   - Include dosages and duration of any self-treatment

4. **Associated Manifestations**
   - System-specific review targeting likely differential diagnoses
   - Red flag symptoms requiring urgent evaluation
   - Constitutional symptoms (fever, weight change, fatigue, night sweats)

**Review of Systems Preparation**
Complete a systematic self-review before the appointment:
- General: weight changes, fatigue, fever, appetite
- HEENT: visual changes, hearing, sinus, dental
- Cardiovascular: chest pain, palpitations, edema, dyspnea
- Respiratory: cough, sputum, dyspnea, wheezing
- Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, bleeding
- Genitourinary: frequency, urgency, dysuria, discharge
- Musculoskeletal: joint pain, swelling, stiffness, weakness
- Neurological: headache, dizziness, numbness, weakness, memory
- Psychiatric: mood, anxiety, sleep, concentration
- Skin: rashes, lesions, changes in moles, pruritus

**Data Integration**
Compile relevant objective data:
- Home monitoring values (blood pressure, glucose, weight logs)
- Previous laboratory or imaging results
- Wearable device downloads with relevant timestamps
- Photographic documentation of visible findings with measurement references

## Medication List Preparation

### Complexity Level 1 (Ages 5-8)
Medicine helps make you feel better when you're sick! Before going to the doctor, a grown-up will help you make a list of any medicine you take. This includes:

- Medicine you take every day
- Vitamins or gummy vitamins
- Medicine you use only when you feel sick

Your parent or caregiver will write down the names and put the list in their bag. Some people bring all their medicine bottles in a bag to show the doctor - that works too!

**Helpful Hint**: If you know what your medicine looks like (maybe it's a pink liquid or little white pills), you can help by remembering that!

---

### Complexity Level 2 (Ages 9-12)
A medication list is super important because:
- Doctors need to know what you already take
