# Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME)

## What Your Body Does to Medications

---

## Level 1: Basic Understanding

### The Journey of Medicine Through Your Body

When you take medicine, your body handles it in four main steps:

**1. Getting In (Absorption)**
- Medicine goes from where you took it into your blood
- Pills dissolve in stomach, then enter blood through intestines

**2. Moving Around (Distribution)**
- Blood carries medicine throughout your body
- Medicine reaches the places where it works

**3. Breaking Down (Metabolism)**
- Your liver changes medicine into different forms
- This often makes medicine easier to remove

**4. Getting Out (Excretion)**
- Your body removes the medicine
- Mostly through kidneys (urine) or liver (stool)

### Why This Matters to You

- Explains why you take medicine at certain times
- Explains why some medicines work faster than others
- Helps you understand food and drug interactions

## Level 2: Fundamental Concepts

### Absorption: Getting the Drug In

**Oral Medications (By Mouth)**
- Must survive stomach acid
- Absorbed mainly in small intestine
- Goes to liver first before reaching body (first-pass effect)

**Factors Affecting Absorption:**
- **Empty vs full stomach**: Some drugs absorb better with food, others without
- **Drug form**: Liquids absorb faster than tablets
- **Stomach acid**: Some drugs need acid, others are damaged by it

**Other Routes:**
| Route | Speed | Examples |
|-------|-------|----------|
| IV injection | Immediate | Emergency drugs |
| Under tongue | Fast (minutes) | Nitroglycerin |
| Skin patch | Slow, steady | Nicotine patch |
| Inhaled | Very fast | Asthma inhalers |

### Distribution: Where the Drug Goes

**Carried by Blood**
- Some drugs float freely in blood
- Others attach to blood proteins (albumin)
- Only free drug can work

**Reaching Tissues**
- Drugs leave blood to enter tissues
- Some tissues easy to reach (muscle)
- Some tissues hard to reach (brain has barrier)

**Fat-Soluble vs Water-Soluble**
- Fat-soluble drugs: Store in body fat, stay longer
- Water-soluble drugs: Stay in blood, leave faster

### Metabolism: Changing the Drug

**The Liver Is the Main Processor**
- Enzymes change drugs into different forms
- Usually makes drugs less active
- Sometimes makes drugs more active (prodrugs)

**Why Metabolism Matters**
- Determines how long drug works
- Affects drug interactions
- Varies between people

### Excretion: Removing the Drug

**Main Exit Routes:**
- **Kidneys**: Most drugs leave in urine
- **Liver/Bile**: Some drugs leave in stool
- **Lungs**: Anesthesia gases breathed out
- **Sweat/Saliva**: Minor route for some drugs

---

## Level 3: Intermediate Knowledge

### Detailed Absorption Concepts

**Bioavailability**
- Percentage of drug that reaches bloodstream
- IV drugs: 100% bioavailability (directly in blood)
- Oral drugs: Often 10-90% bioavailability

**First-Pass Metabolism**
- Oral drugs go to liver before body
- Liver may break down large portion
- Some drugs avoid this (sublingual, rectal)

**Factors Affecting Oral Absorption:**
| Factor | Effect | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Stomach pH | Changes drug dissolution | Antacids reduce ketoconazole absorption |
| Food | Can help or hurt | Take metformin with food |
| Gut motility | Faster transit = less absorption | Diarrhea reduces absorption |
| Drug interactions | Other drugs compete | Calcium blocks tetracycline |

**Enteric Coating**
- Protects drug from stomach acid
- Drug releases in intestine instead
- Don't crush these medications!

### Distribution Principles

**Volume of Distribution (Vd)**
- Measures how widely drug spreads
- Low Vd: Drug stays in blood
- High Vd: Drug spreads into tissues

**Protein Binding**
- Many drugs bind to blood proteins
- Only unbound drug is active
- Drug interactions can displace bound drugs

**Special Barriers:**
- **Blood-Brain Barrier**: Protects brain, limits drug entry
- **Placental Barrier**: Most drugs can cross to fetus
- **Blood-Testis Barrier**: Limits drug entry to testes

### Metabolism Details

**Phase I Reactions (Cytochrome P450)**
- Oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis
- CYP enzymes in liver do most work
- Common CYP enzymes: 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 1A2

**Phase II Reactions (Conjugation)**
- Add water-soluble group to drug
- Makes drug easier to excrete
- Glucuronidation, sulfation, acetylation

**Drug Interactions at Metabolism Level:**
- Inhibitors: Block enzymes, increase drug levels
- Inducers: Boost enzymes, decrease drug levels

### Excretion Pathways

**Renal Excretion**
- Filtration: Small drugs filtered by kidney
- Secretion: Active transport into urine
- Reabsorption: Some drug reclaimed from urine

**Hepatic Excretion**
- Drug excreted in bile
- Goes to intestine
- May be reabsorbed (enterohepatic circulation)

## Level 4: Advanced Understanding

### Pharmacokinetic Parameters

#### Absorption Kinetics

**Rate of Absorption**
- Zero-order: Constant amount absorbed per time
- First-order: Constant fraction absorbed per time

**Key Parameters:**
- **Tmax**: Time to peak concentration
- **Cmax**: Maximum concentration achieved
- **AUC**: Area under curve (total drug exposure)

**Bioequivalence**
- Generic must match brand's Cmax and AUC (within 80-125%)
- Ensures similar therapeutic effect

#### Distribution Kinetics

**Compartment Models**
- One-compartment: Drug distributes instantly
- Two-compartment: Fast distribution to blood, slower to tissues
- Multi-compartment: Complex distribution patterns

**Volume of Distribution Calculations**
```
Vd = Dose / Initial Plasma Concentration
```

**Clinical Implications:**
- Small Vd (3-5L): Drug stays in blood (aspirin)
- Large Vd (>100L): Drug distributes to tissues (digoxin)
- Affects loading dose calculations

#### Hepatic Metabolism

**Enzyme Kinetics**
- Michaelis-Menten kinetics at high concentrations
- First-order kinetics at low concentrations
- Some drugs show zero-order (saturation) kinetics

**Cytochrome P450 System:**
| Enzyme | Drugs Metabolized | Inhibitors | Inducers |
|--------|-------------------|------------|----------|
| CYP3A4 | 50% of drugs | Ketoconazole, grapefruit | Rifampin |
| CYP2D6 | Codeine, antidepressants | Fluoxetine | None (genetic) |
| CYP2C9 | Warfarin, NSAIDs | Fluconazole | Rifampin |
| CYP2C19 | Clopidogrel, PPIs | Omeprazole | Rifampin |
| CYP1A2 | Caffeine, theophylline | Ciprofloxacin | Smoking |

**Genetic Polymorphisms:**
- Poor metabolizers: Drug accumulates
- Ultra-rapid metabolizers: Drug cleared too fast
- Affects dosing for many medications

#### Excretion Kinetics

**Renal Clearance**
```
CLrenal = (Urine concentration × Urine flow) / Plasma concentration
```

**Hepatic Clearance**
- Depends on: Blood flow, protein binding, enzyme activity
- High extraction ratio: Limited by blood flow
- Low extraction ratio: Limited by enzyme activity

4. Free drug reabsorbed
5. Multiple peaks in plasma concentration

**Clinical Examples:**
- Morphine
- Estrogens (oral contraceptives)
- Certain antibiotics

**Drug Interactions:**
- Antibiotics disrupt gut bacteria
- May reduce reabsorption of affected drugs

### Chronopharmacokinetics

**Time-Dependent Changes:**
- Gastric emptying varies with circadian rhythm
- Liver blood flow changes throughout day
- Kidney function has diurnal pattern

**Clinical Implications:**
- Some drugs more effective at certain times
- May explain variable drug responses

### Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations

**Obesity:**
- Fat-soluble drugs: Larger Vd
- Water-soluble drugs: Dosing based on ideal weight
- Hepatic metabolism may be increased

**Critical Illness:**

## Practical Applications

### Understanding Your Medications

**Questions About Absorption:**
- Should I take this with food?
- Can I take it with other medications?
- Is there a liquid option if I can't swallow pills?

**Questions About Distribution:**
- How long until it starts working?
- Does it reach my brain/affected area?

**Questions About Metabolism:**
- Will grapefruit juice affect it?
- Do I need genetic testing?
- What drugs interact with it?

**Questions About Excretion:**
- Is dose adjustment needed for my kidney function?
- How long does it stay in my system?

### Why Dosing Instructions Matter

| Instruction | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Take on empty stomach | Food decreases absorption |
| Take with food | Reduces stomach upset or improves absorption |
| Take at same time daily | Maintains steady blood levels |
| Avoid grapefruit | Inhibits metabolism, increases drug levels |
| Space from antacids | Antacids reduce absorption |
