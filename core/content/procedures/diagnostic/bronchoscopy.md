# Bronchoscopy

## Overview

**Complexity Level: 3** (Moderate, requires sedation and specialized equipment)

Bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to examine the inside of your airways (trachea and bronchi) using a thin, flexible tube with a camera and light. This procedure helps diagnose and sometimes treat conditions affecting your lungs and airways.

## Why It's Done

### Diagnostic Purposes

- **Evaluate abnormal chest X-ray or CT findings**
- **Diagnose lung infections**: Including tuberculosis and pneumonia
- **Investigate persistent cough**: Especially with blood
- **Diagnose lung cancer**: Obtain tissue samples from suspicious masses
- **Evaluate airway narrowing or blockage**
- **Identify causes of breathing problems**
- **Collect samples**: From airways or lung tissue for testing
- **Staging cancer**: Sampling lymph nodes near airways

### Therapeutic Purposes

- Remove foreign objects from airways
- Open blocked airways (stent placement, tumor removal)
- Drain fluid from lung abscess
- Stop bleeding in the airways
- Deliver radiation therapy (brachytherapy)
- Remove mucus plugs

## Types of Bronchoscopy

**Flexible bronchoscopy**: Most common, uses a thin, bendable scope
**Rigid bronchoscopy**: Uses a straight, metal tube; requires general anesthesia; for specific therapeutic procedures
**Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)**: Combines bronchoscopy with ultrasound to sample lymph nodes
**Navigational bronchoscopy**: Uses CT-guided navigation to reach distant lung lesions

## How to Prepare

### Before the Procedure

**Medical preparation**:
- Pre-procedure testing may include blood work, chest X-ray, or lung function tests
- Review all medications with your doctor
- You may need to stop blood thinners (follow specific instructions)
- Discuss allergies, especially to lidocaine or sedation medications

**Fasting requirements**:
- No food or drink for 6-8 hours before
- Take essential medications with a small sip of water

**Practical preparation**:
- Arrange for someone to drive you home
- Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing
- Leave jewelry and valuables at home
- Remove dentures, glasses, and contact lenses before procedure

### What to Tell Your Healthcare Provider

Inform your provider if you:
- Have heart or lung disease
- Have bleeding problems or take blood thinners
- Are allergic to medications (especially anesthetics)
- Have had previous throat or lung surgery
- Have sleep apnea
- Have difficulty lying flat
- Are or might be pregnant
- Take oxygen at home

## What to Expect During the Procedure

### Location and Setting

- Performed in a procedure room, operating room, or specialized bronchoscopy suite
- Continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels
- Duration: 30-60 minutes (may be longer for complex procedures)

### Preparation Steps

1. **IV placement**: For sedation and fluids
2. **Monitoring**: Heart monitor, blood pressure cuff, and oxygen sensor attached
3. **Supplemental oxygen**: Given through nasal cannula or mask
4. **Positioning**: You may sit upright or lie on your back

### Sedation Options

**Moderate sedation (most common)**:
- Medication through IV to make you relaxed and drowsy
- You can respond but may not remember the procedure

**Deep sedation or general anesthesia**:
- For complex or lengthy procedures
- You're completely asleep
- Administered by anesthesiologist

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Anesthesia to the airways**
   - Lidocaine spray or nebulized medication numbs your throat
   - More lidocaine is applied through the scope as it advances
   - This prevents coughing and gag reflex

2. **Scope insertion**
   - The bronchoscope enters through your nose or mouth
   - It passes through your vocal cords into the trachea (windpipe)
   - You may feel pressure but should not feel pain

3. **Airway examination**
   - The doctor examines the airways systematically
   - Air passages are evaluated for abnormalities
   - The scope can reach deep into the lungs

4. **Sample collection (if needed)**
   - **Bronchial washing**: Saline is squirted and suctioned back
   - **Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)**: Larger volume washing of a lung segment
   - **Brushing**: A small brush collects cells
   - **Biopsy**: Forceps take tiny tissue samples
   - **Needle aspiration**: For lymph nodes or masses

5. **Therapeutic interventions (if needed)**
   - Foreign object removal
   - Stent placement
   - Bleeding control
   - Mucus plug removal

6. **Completion**
   - The scope is withdrawn
   - Your throat remains numb for 1-2 hours

### What Sensations Are Normal

- Pressure in throat and chest
- Urge to cough (especially early in procedure)
- Feeling of not getting enough air (oxygen is being delivered)
- Strange sensation when lidocaine is sprayed
- Gagging when scope passes vocal cords
- Brief discomfort during biopsies (if performed)

## Recovery and Aftercare

### In the Recovery Area (1-2 Hours)

- Vital signs are monitored
- Oxygen continues until you're fully awake
- Your throat remains numb—no eating or drinking initially
- Coughing and throat clearing are normal
- You may have a hoarse voice temporarily

### Before Leaving

You must demonstrate:
- Stable vital signs
- Ability to swallow safely (usually tested 1-2 hours after)
- No signs of breathing problems
- Someone to drive you home

### First 24 Hours

**Do**:
- Rest and take it easy
- Start with sips of water, advance to soft foods when swallowing normally
- Drink plenty of fluids
- Take throat lozenges for sore throat
- Use humidifier if helpful

**Avoid**:
- Eating or drinking until gag reflex returns (usually 1-2 hours)
- Driving for 24 hours
- Making important decisions (sedation effects)
- Smoking
- Strenuous activity

### Expected Symptoms

- Sore throat for 1-2 days
- Hoarse voice for 1-2 days
- Mild coughing
- Small amount of blood-tinged sputum (normal if biopsies were done)
- Fatigue from sedation

### When to Seek Medical Care

**Call your doctor or go to the ER immediately for**:
- Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Fever over 100.4°F (38°C)
- Coughing up more than a tablespoon of blood
- Severe throat pain or difficulty swallowing

## When Results Are Available

### Immediate Results

- Your doctor can describe what was seen during the procedure
- Obvious abnormalities, blockages, or inflammation are noted
- Initial impressions are shared

### Laboratory Results

| Test Type | Typical Turnaround |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Cytology (cell examination) | 3-5 days |
| Biopsy pathology | 3-7 days |
| Bacterial cultures | 2-5 days |
| Fungal cultures | 2-4 weeks |
| Tuberculosis cultures | 2-8 weeks |
| Special stains and tests | 1-2 weeks |

### Follow-Up

- Results are typically discussed at a follow-up appointment
- Treatment plans are made based on findings
- Additional testing may be recommended

## Special Considerations

### Endobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS)

If you're having EBUS:
- A special bronchoscope with ultrasound is used
- Allows sampling of lymph nodes outside the airways
- Procedure may take longer (45-90 minutes)
- Important for cancer staging

### Navigational Bronchoscopy

If you're having navigational bronchoscopy:
- CT-guided technology helps reach peripheral lung nodules
- May take longer than standard bronchoscopy
- Higher success rate for distant lesions

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will I be able to breathe during the procedure?**
Yes. The bronchoscope is thin and doesn't block your airway. Supplemental oxygen is provided throughout the procedure.

**Will I be asleep?**
Most people receive moderate sedation—you're very drowsy and usually don't remember the procedure, but you're not completely unconscious.

**Does it hurt?**
The numbing medication prevents pain. You may feel pressure, discomfort, and the urge to cough, but not sharp pain.

**Why is my throat numb so long afterward?**
The lidocaine used to numb your airways takes 1-2 hours to wear off. Don't eat or drink until you can swallow normally.

**What if I cough during the procedure?**
Some coughing is normal, especially at the beginning. Additional lidocaine can be given if needed. The team is experienced in managing this.

**How long until I can eat normally?**
Once your gag reflex returns (usually 1-2 hours), start with clear liquids and advance as tolerated. Most people eat normally by evening.

**When can I return to work?**
Most people can return to work the next day, though some take 2 days for full recovery.

**Is bronchoscopy safe for people with lung disease?**
Yes, though extra precautions may be taken. Your doctor will assess your risks and benefits beforehand.

**What if the biopsy results are inconclusive?**
Additional procedures or different testing approaches may be needed. Your doctor will discuss next steps.
