# Cardiac Catheterization (Heart Catheterization)

## Overview

**Complexity Level: 4** (Invasive procedure requiring specialized cardiac catheterization lab)

Cardiac catheterization is a procedure where a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is threaded through a blood vessel to your heart. This allows doctors to diagnose and sometimes treat heart conditions. It's one of the most important tools for evaluating heart disease.

## Why It's Done

### Diagnostic Purposes

- **Coronary angiography**: Visualize arteries that supply blood to the heart
- **Evaluate chest pain**: Determine if blocked arteries are the cause
- **Assess heart attack**: Identify which arteries are blocked
- **Measure pressures**: In heart chambers and blood vessels
- **Evaluate heart valve function**: Assess severity of valve problems
- **Check heart muscle function**: Measure how well your heart pumps
- **Diagnose congenital heart defects**: Identify structural abnormalities

### Therapeutic Purposes (Intervention)

- **Angioplasty**: Open blocked arteries with a balloon
- **Stent placement**: Insert a mesh tube to keep arteries open
- **Valve repair/replacement**: Some valves can be treated via catheter
- **Close holes in the heart**: Certain defects can be repaired
- **Treat arrhythmias**: Ablation of abnormal electrical pathways

## How to Prepare

### Before the Procedure

**Medical preparation**:
- Blood tests (kidney function, clotting tests, complete blood count)
- ECG (electrocardiogram)
- Chest X-ray
- Review of all medications
- Discussion of allergies, especially to contrast dye or iodine

**Fasting**:
- No food for 6-8 hours before
- Clear liquids may be allowed until 2-4 hours before
- Follow your specific instructions

**Medications**:
- Your doctor will provide specific instructions for each medication
- Blood thinners may be adjusted or stopped temporarily
- Diabetes medications may need modification
- Some medications should be taken with a sip of water

### What to Tell Your Healthcare Provider

Inform your provider if you:
- Have kidney problems (contrast dye can affect kidneys)
- Are allergic to contrast dye, iodine, or shellfish
- Are allergic to any medications (especially aspirin, blood thinners)
- Have bleeding problems
- Are or might be pregnant
- Have diabetes
- Take blood thinners (warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel, newer anticoagulants)
- Have had previous heart procedures
- Have a pacemaker or defibrillator

### Practical Preparation

- Arrange for someone to drive you home (or plan for hospital stay)
- Plan for someone to stay with you for 24 hours after
- Bring a list of all your medications
- Wear comfortable, loose clothing
- Leave jewelry and valuables at home
- Bring personal items for potential overnight stay

## What to Expect During the Procedure

### Location

- Performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory ("cath lab")
- Special X-ray equipment allows real-time imaging
- Highly trained team of doctors, nurses, and technicians

### Access Sites

The catheter can be inserted through:
- **Femoral artery**: In the groin (traditional approach)
- **Radial artery**: In the wrist (increasingly common, faster recovery)
- **Brachial artery**: In the arm (less common)

### Step-by-Step Process

**Duration**: 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on what's being done

1. **Preparation**
   - You change into a hospital gown
   - An IV is placed for medications and fluids
   - You lie on a table with X-ray equipment around you
   - Monitoring equipment is attached (ECG, blood pressure, oxygen)

2. **Sedation**
   - You receive medication to help you relax
   - You're typically awake but drowsy
   - General anesthesia is rarely needed

3. **Local anesthesia**
   - The access site (groin or wrist) is numbed
   - You'll feel a brief sting from the numbing medication

4. **Catheter insertion**
   - A small incision or needle puncture is made
   - A sheath (short tube) is placed in the artery
   - Catheters are threaded through the sheath to your heart
   - You may feel pressure but should not feel pain

5. **Imaging and measurements**
   - Contrast dye is injected through the catheter
   - X-ray images (angiograms) show your arteries
   - You may feel a warm, flushing sensation when dye is injected
   - Pressure measurements are taken in your heart
   - You may be asked to hold your breath or cough

6. **Intervention (if needed)**
   - If significant blockages are found, treatment may occur during the same procedure
   - Balloon angioplasty and stent placement can be done immediately
   - Additional consent may be obtained if intervention wasn't planned

7. **Completion**
   - Catheters are removed
   - The access site is sealed:
     - **Groin**: Manual pressure, closure device, or compression device
     - **Wrist**: Compression band
   - You're moved to recovery

### What Sensations Are Normal

- Pressure at the access site during catheter insertion
- Warm, flushing feeling when contrast dye is injected (lasts seconds)
- Temporary feeling like you need to urinate (from contrast)
- Sensation of your heart beating differently momentarily
- Slight headache from contrast dye
- Lying flat may become uncomfortable

## Recovery and Aftercare

### Immediate Recovery (First 2-6 Hours)

**If femoral (groin) access**:
- Lie flat with your leg straight for 2-6 hours
- A sandbag or compression device may be placed on your groin
- Do not lift your head or sit up until told it's safe
- Staff will check your pulse and access site frequently

**If radial (wrist) access**:
- A compression band is on your wrist for 1-2 hours
- You can sit up immediately
- Keep your arm relatively still

### Before Discharge

- Access site is checked for bleeding or complications
- Vital signs are stable
- No signs of complications
- You can walk (if groin access was used, after bed rest period)
- Instructions are provided for home care

### At Home - First 24-48 Hours

**Do**:
- Rest and take it easy
- Drink extra fluids to help flush out the contrast dye
- Take medications as prescribed
- Keep the access site clean and dry
- Check the site periodically for bleeding or swelling

**Avoid**:
- Strenuous activity and heavy lifting (5-10 pounds) for 3-5 days
- Climbing stairs excessively on day 1
- Driving for at least 24 hours (longer if you received sedation)
- Bathing/swimming for 1-2 days (showering is usually okay after 24 hours)

### Access Site Care

**Groin access**:
- Keep the area clean and dry
- Slight bruising is normal
- Avoid bending at the waist excessively
- When coughing or straining, apply light pressure to the site
- No baths, pools, or hot tubs for 1 week

**Wrist access**:
- Keep the wrist band on as long as instructed
- Some bruising and soreness is normal
- Avoid heavy gripping or lifting for a few days

### When to Seek Medical Care

**Call your doctor or go to the ER immediately for**:
- Bleeding from the access site that doesn't stop with pressure
- Large or growing bruise at the site
- Pain, numbness, or coolness in the leg or arm below the access site
- Fever over 100.4°F (38°C)
- Chest pain or shortness of breath
- Rash, itching, or swelling (possible allergic reaction)
- Decreased urine output or dark urine
- Swelling at the access site (may indicate pseudoaneurysm)

- Other cardiac procedures
- Close follow-up

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will I be asleep?**
You'll receive sedation to relax you, but you'll typically be awake and able to follow instructions. General anesthesia is rarely needed.

**Does it hurt?**
The numbing medication causes brief stinging. During the procedure, you feel pressure but not pain. The warm sensation from contrast dye is strange but not painful.

**Why do I have to lie flat after?**
With groin access, lying flat helps the artery seal and prevents bleeding. Wrist access allows you to sit up immediately.

**Can they fix blockages during the diagnostic test?**
Yes, often. If significant blockages are found, angioplasty and stenting may be done immediately (with your consent).

**How long until I can return to normal activities?**
Most people return to normal activities within 2-5 days. Heavy lifting and strenuous exercise should wait 1 week or as directed.

**What if I'm allergic to contrast dye?**
Tell your doctor. Premedication with steroids and antihistamines can prevent most reactions. Alternative approaches may also be considered.

**Is radiation exposure a concern?**
Radiation is minimized with modern equipment. The benefit of the procedure typically outweighs the small radiation risk.

**How often will I need this procedure?**
Depends on your findings and condition. Some people need one procedure, while others may need repeat catheterizations for monitoring or additional treatment.
