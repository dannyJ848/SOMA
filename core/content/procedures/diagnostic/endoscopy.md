# Endoscopy (EGD and Colonoscopy)

## Overview

**Complexity Level: 3** (Moderate, requires sedation and bowel preparation for colonoscopy)

Endoscopy is a procedure that uses a flexible tube with a camera and light to examine the inside of your digestive tract. The two most common types are:

- **EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy)**: Examines the upper digestive tract—esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine
- **Colonoscopy**: Examines the large intestine (colon) and rectum

## Why It's Done

### Upper Endoscopy (EGD)

**Diagnostic purposes**:
- Investigate persistent heartburn or acid reflux
- Evaluate difficulty swallowing
- Find the cause of unexplained nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain
- Identify sources of upper GI bleeding
- Screen for Barrett's esophagus
- Diagnose ulcers, inflammation, or tumors

**Therapeutic purposes**:
- Remove foreign objects
- Dilate (stretch) narrowed areas
- Treat bleeding vessels
- Remove polyps or early cancers

### Colonoscopy

**Diagnostic purposes**:
- Screen for colon cancer (recommended starting at age 45)
- Investigate rectal bleeding or blood in stool
- Evaluate chronic diarrhea or constipation
- Find the cause of unexplained abdominal pain
- Monitor inflammatory bowel disease
- Surveillance after previous polyps or colon cancer

**Therapeutic purposes**:
- Remove polyps before they become cancerous
- Take tissue samples (biopsies)
- Treat bleeding sites
- Dilate strictures

## How to Prepare

### Upper Endoscopy (EGD)

**Fasting requirements**:
- No food for 6-8 hours before the procedure
- Clear liquids may be allowed up to 2-4 hours before
- Follow your specific instructions carefully

**Medications**:
- Most medications can be taken with a small sip of water
- Blood thinners may need to be stopped (follow your doctor's instructions)
- Diabetes medications may need adjustment

### Colonoscopy - Bowel Preparation

The bowel must be completely clean for a successful colonoscopy. This is often the most challenging part of the procedure.

**Diet changes (typically 1-3 days before)**:
- **Day -3 to -1**: Low-fiber diet (avoid nuts, seeds, raw vegetables)
- **Day before**: Clear liquids only (broth, Jell-O, clear juices, water)
- **Avoid**: Red or purple liquids (can mimic blood during the exam)

**The prep solution**:
Several types exist—follow your specific instructions exactly:
- **Split-dose prep** (most common): Half the evening before, half the morning of
- **Evening-only prep**: Full dose the night before (less preferred)

**What to expect during prep**:
- Multiple loose bowel movements
- Clear to light yellow liquid stool by completion
- Possible cramping, bloating, nausea
- Need to stay close to a bathroom for several hours

**Tips for easier prep**:
- Chill the solution if allowed
- Use a straw to bypass taste buds
- Suck on hard candy between sips (avoid red/purple)
- Add approved flavor enhancers if permitted
- Stay near the bathroom with entertainment
- Use soft toilet paper or wipes to prevent irritation
- Apply barrier cream to prevent skin irritation

### For Both Procedures

**Arrange for**:
- A ride home (required—you cannot drive after sedation)
- Someone to stay with you for several hours after
- Time off work the day of the procedure

**What to tell your healthcare provider**:
- All medications and supplements
- Allergies (especially to medications or latex)
- Previous reactions to sedation or anesthesia
- Bleeding disorders or blood thinner use
- Heart conditions or pacemaker/defibrillator
- Lung disease or sleep apnea
- Pregnancy or possibility of pregnancy
- Previous surgeries on your digestive tract

## What to Expect During the Procedure

### Arrival and Preparation

- Arrive 1-2 hours before scheduled procedure time
- Change into a hospital gown
- An IV line is placed for sedation and fluids
- Vital signs are monitored
- You'll speak with your doctor and anesthesia provider

### Sedation Options

**Moderate sedation (conscious sedation)**: Most common
- You're drowsy but can respond to instructions
- You likely won't remember the procedure
- Given through your IV

**Deep sedation/Propofol**: Increasingly used
- You're asleep and unaware during the procedure
- Often administered by an anesthesiologist
- Faster recovery than moderate sedation

**General anesthesia**: Occasionally needed
- For very long or complex procedures
- Or if other sedation has failed before

### Upper Endoscopy (EGD) - The Procedure

**Duration**: 10-20 minutes

1. **Preparation**
   - Throat spray to numb your gag reflex (tastes bitter)
   - A mouth guard protects your teeth
   - You lie on your left side

2. **The examination**
   - The scope is passed over your tongue and down your throat
   - You may feel pressure but should not feel pain
   - Air is introduced to open up the view
   - The doctor examines the lining carefully

3. **Biopsies or treatment**
   - Tissue samples may be taken (not painful)
   - Polyps may be removed
   - Other treatments as needed

4. **Completion**
   - The scope is gently withdrawn
   - Total time with sedation and recovery: 1-2 hours

### Colonoscopy - The Procedure

**Duration**: 20-45 minutes

1. **Preparation**
   - You lie on your left side with knees drawn up
   - Sedation is administered

2. **The examination**
   - The scope is inserted through the rectum
   - Air or carbon dioxide inflates the colon for better viewing
   - The scope advances through the entire colon
   - You may feel pressure or mild cramping

3. **The detailed examination**
   - As the scope is slowly withdrawn, all surfaces are examined
   - Polyps are removed if found
   - Biopsies are taken as needed

4. **Completion**
   - Air is suctioned out to reduce bloating
   - The scope is removed
   - Total time with sedation and recovery: 2-3 hours

### What Sensations Are Normal

**EGD**:
- Gagging before sedation takes effect
- Pressure in your throat
- Bloating from air
- Sore throat afterward

**Colonoscopy**:
- Pressure or mild cramping during the procedure
- Sensation of needing to have a bowel movement
- Bloating and gas after
- Mild abdominal discomfort afterward

## Recovery and Aftercare

### In the Recovery Area (1-2 Hours)

- You'll wake gradually as sedation wears off
- Nurses monitor your vital signs
- You may not remember waking up initially
- You can drink water or juice when awake
- Gas and bloating are normal and will pass

### After EGD

**Immediately**:
- Sore throat is common (usually resolves in 24-48 hours)

## When Results Are Available

### Immediate Results

Your doctor will speak with you after the procedure about:
- What was seen during the examination
- Any polyps removed
- General appearance of the tissue
- Preliminary recommendations

### Pathology Results

If biopsies or polyps were taken:
- Results typically available in 5-7 days
- Your doctor's office will contact you
- Follow-up appointment may be scheduled

### Screening Intervals

After colonoscopy, your next one may be scheduled:
- **Normal, no polyps**: 10 years for average risk
- **Small polyps removed**: 5-10 years

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will I be asleep?**
Most people are sedated to the point where they're unaware and don't remember the procedure, but you're not under general anesthesia unless specifically planned.

**Is the prep really that bad?**
The prep is unpleasant but manageable. Most people tolerate it well, especially with the tips provided. The key is completing it fully for a successful exam.

**Can polyps be cancerous?**
Most polyps are benign, but some types can become cancer over time. Removing them during colonoscopy prevents this progression.

**How long until the sedation wears off?**
You'll feel mostly normal within a few hours, but judgment and reflexes may be impaired for 24 hours. That's why you cannot drive.

**What if they find something?**
Your doctor will discuss findings with you. Many findings (like polyps) are handled during the procedure itself. Others may require follow-up testing or treatment.

**Can I request extra sedation if I'm anxious?**
Discuss your concerns with your doctor. Sedation can be adjusted, or you may be offered propofol or other options.

**What if my colonoscopy prep isn't complete?**
Tell your doctor. An incomplete prep may mean a less thorough exam or the need to reschedule. The quality of your prep directly affects the quality of the exam.

**How often should I have a colonoscopy?**
For average-risk people, screening should start at age 45, with repeat every 10 years if normal. More frequent exams may be needed based on findings, family history, or personal risk factors.
