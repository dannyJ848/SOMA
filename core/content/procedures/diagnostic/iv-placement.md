# IV Placement (Intravenous Catheter Insertion)

## Overview

**Complexity Level: 1** (Routine, minimally invasive)

An IV (intravenous) line is a small, flexible plastic tube inserted into a vein to deliver fluids, medications, blood products, or nutrition directly into your bloodstream. IV placement is one of the most common medical procedures performed in hospitals and clinics.

## Why It's Done

An IV provides direct access to your bloodstream for:

- **Fluid administration**: Hydration, electrolyte replacement
- **Medication delivery**: Antibiotics, pain medications, chemotherapy
- **Blood transfusions**: Red blood cells, platelets, plasma
- **Nutrition**: When you cannot eat by mouth
- **Contrast dyes**: For certain imaging tests (CT, MRI)
- **Emergency access**: Rapid medication delivery if needed

## How to Prepare

### Before the Procedure

**There is usually no special preparation required**

General tips:
- Stay hydrated if possible (makes veins easier to access)
- Wear short sleeves or loose-fitting clothing
- Remove jewelry from your hands and wrists
- Inform staff of any allergies, especially to tape or latex

### What to Tell Your Healthcare Provider

Inform your provider if you:
- Have had difficult IV placements before
- Have a preferred arm or site that has worked well
- Take blood thinners
- Have a history of blood clots
- Have had a mastectomy (avoid that arm)
- Have a fistula for dialysis (avoid that arm)
- Have skin conditions or infections on your arms
- Are allergic to tape, latex, or antiseptic solutions

## What to Expect During the Procedure

### Step-by-Step Process

**Duration**: 5-10 minutes typically

1. **Site selection**
   - The nurse examines your arms and hands for suitable veins
   - Common sites: back of hand, inner forearm, inner elbow (antecubital area)
   - The site is chosen based on vein visibility, planned use, and your comfort

2. **Tourniquet application**
   - An elastic band is placed above the insertion site
   - This makes veins more visible and prominent
   - You may be asked to make a fist or hang your arm down

3. **Skin preparation**
   - The area is cleaned with antiseptic (usually chlorhexidine or alcohol)
   - Allow the solution to dry (about 30 seconds)

4. **Insertion**
   - You'll feel a quick pinch or stick as the needle enters
   - Once in the vein, the plastic catheter is advanced and the needle is removed
   - Only the soft, flexible plastic tube remains in your vein

5. **Securing the IV**
   - The catheter is taped securely in place
   - A transparent dressing covers the site
   - Tubing is connected and the IV is tested

6. **Verification**
   - Fluid flows easily into the vein
   - There's no swelling, pain, or leaking at the site
   - The date and time of insertion may be labeled

### What Sensations Are Normal

- Brief sharp pinch during needle insertion (1-2 seconds)
- Pressure as the catheter is advanced
- Mild discomfort when IV is flushed with saline
- Cool sensation as fluids enter your vein
- Some awareness of the catheter, especially when moving

## Recovery and Aftercare

### While the IV Is In Place

**Do**:
- Keep the site clean and dry
- Report any pain, swelling, or redness immediately
- Move your arm normally but avoid excessive bending at the site
- Protect the IV when bathing (wrap with plastic)
- Tell your nurse if the IV stops dripping or if you hear the pump alarm

**Avoid**:
- Pulling on the tubing or dressing
- Immersing the site in water
- Sleeping on the arm with the IV if possible
- Carrying heavy objects with that arm

### After IV Removal

1. The nurse removes the dressing and gently pulls out the catheter
2. Pressure is applied with gauze for 1-2 minutes
3. A small bandage is placed over the site

**Aftercare**:
- Keep the bandage on for 2-4 hours
- Minor bruising is normal and resolves in a few days
- Mild tenderness at the site is common

## Risks and Complications

### Common (Usually Minor)

| Issue | What It Looks Like | What to Do |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Bruising | Purple/blue discoloration | Ice, then warm compress after 24 hours |
| Minor discomfort | Tenderness at site | Usually resolves quickly |
| Irritation | Redness from tape | Request hypoallergenic tape |

### Less Common (Tell Your Nurse Immediately)

**Infiltration**
- The IV slips out of the vein
- Fluid leaks into surrounding tissue
- Signs: swelling, coolness, pain at site
- Solution: IV is removed and restarted elsewhere

**Phlebitis** (vein inflammation)
- Signs: redness, warmth, tenderness along the vein
- A firm "cord" may be felt along the vein path
- Solution: IV is removed; warm compresses applied

**Hematoma**
- Blood collects under the skin
- Appears as a raised bruise
- Usually resolves on its own

### Rare

- **Infection**: Redness, pus, fever (seek medical attention)
- **Blood clot in the vein**: Usually treated with warm compresses
- **Air embolism**: Extremely rare with modern equipment

## When Results Are Available

IV placement itself doesn't produce test results. However, if blood is drawn through the IV during insertion:
- Results timing depends on the specific tests ordered
- Basic labs: Same day to 24 hours
- Most results: 1-3 days

## Tips for an Easier IV Placement

### Help Your Veins Be More Visible

- Drink plenty of fluids beforehand
- Keep your arms warm
- Let your arm hang down for a minute before insertion
- Open and close your fist several times

### Communicate With Your Nurse

- Share which sites have worked well before
- Mention if you've had difficult sticks in the past
- Ask for a senior nurse or IV team if available
- Request numbing cream if you're very anxious (may need to be applied 30-60 minutes before)

### Reduce Anxiety

- Look away during insertion
- Practice slow, deep breathing
- Bring headphones and music
- Chat with the nurse about something else

## IV Maintenance

### Daily Care (For Hospital Stays)

- Your IV site will be checked regularly for signs of problems
- The dressing may be changed every few days
- The IV is typically replaced every 72-96 hours to prevent infection

### Signs That Need Immediate Attention

Contact your nurse right away if you notice:
- Swelling at or above the IV site
- Pain that increases
- Redness spreading from the site
- Leaking around the IV
- The IV looks dislodged
- Fever or chills

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long can an IV stay in?**
Typically 72-96 hours for peripheral IVs. If you need IV access longer, it may be replaced in a new site or a different type of line may be considered.

**Does having an IV restrict my movement?**
Minimally. You can move your arm, walk around (with your IV pole), and do most normal activities. Just avoid pulling on the tubing.

**Can I shower with an IV?**
Ask your nurse. Usually the site needs to be covered with plastic wrap to keep it dry.

**What if multiple attempts are needed?**
Sometimes veins are difficult to access. Most facilities have policies limiting the number of attempts by one person (usually 2) before calling for additional help.

**Why does it sometimes burn when medications go in?**
Some medications cause a temporary burning sensation. This usually stops shortly after the infusion. Tell your nurse if discomfort is significant—the rate can often be adjusted.

**Can I request a specific type of IV?**
You can ask for a smaller needle or a specific site. Let staff know your concerns and preferences.
