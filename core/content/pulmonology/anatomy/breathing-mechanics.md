# How Breathing Works

## Overview
Breathing (ventilation) is the mechanical process of moving air into and out of the lungs. It involves the coordinated action of respiratory muscles, changes in thoracic pressure, and the elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall. At rest, adults breathe 12-20 times per minute, moving approximately 500 mL of air with each breath.

## Mechanics of Ventilation

### Level 1: Foundation
Breathing happens in two phases:

**Inspiration (breathing in):**
- Your diaphragm (dome-shaped muscle below your lungs) contracts and flattens
- Your rib cage expands outward
- This creates more space in your chest
- Air flows into your lungs to fill the space

**Expiration (breathing out):**
- Your diaphragm relaxes and moves upward
- Your rib cage returns to its resting position
- The space in your chest decreases
- Air is pushed out of your lungs

At rest, breathing out is passive - you don't need muscle effort, just relaxation.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Respiratory Muscles:**

**Inspiration (active process):**
- **Diaphragm** (primary muscle):
  - Responsible for 75% of tidal volume at rest
  - Innervated by phrenic nerve (C3-C5)
- **External intercostals**: Elevate ribs (pump-handle and bucket-handle movements)
- **Accessory muscles** (used during increased demand):
  - Sternocleidomastoid
  - Scalenes
  - Pectoralis minor

**Expiration (passive at rest, active when forced):**
- **Passive**: Elastic recoil of lungs and chest wall
- **Active expiration muscles:**
  - Abdominal muscles (rectus abdominis, obliques, transversus)
  - Internal intercostals

**Pressure Changes:**
| Phase | Intrapleural Pressure | Alveolar Pressure | Airflow |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Rest | -5 cm H₂O | 0 (atmospheric) | None |
| Inspiration | -8 cm H₂O | -1 cm H₂O | Into lungs |
| End inspiration | -8 cm H₂O | 0 | None |
| Expiration | -5 cm H₂O | +1 cm H₂O | Out of lungs |

Air flows from high to low pressure.

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Lung Volumes and Capacities:**

**Volumes (cannot be subdivided):**
- **Tidal Volume (TV)**: ~500 mL - normal breath at rest
- **Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV)**: ~3000 mL - extra air you can inhale after normal inspiration
- **Expiratory Reserve Volume (ERV)**: ~1100 mL - extra air you can exhale after normal expiration
- **Residual Volume (RV)**: ~1200 mL - air remaining after maximal expiration (prevents lung collapse)

**Capacities (combinations of volumes):**
- **Vital Capacity (VC)**: TV + IRV + ERV = ~4600 mL - maximum air that can be moved
- **Inspiratory Capacity (IC)**: TV + IRV = ~3500 mL
- **Functional Residual Capacity (FRC)**: ERV + RV = ~2300 mL - air in lungs at end of normal expiration
- **Total Lung Capacity (TLC)**: All volumes = ~5800 mL

**Dead Space:**
- **Anatomic dead space**: ~150 mL (conducting airways with no gas exchange)
- **Physiologic dead space**: Anatomic + alveolar dead space (ventilated but not perfused alveoli)
- In healthy lungs, anatomic ≈ physiologic dead space

**Clinical Observations:**
| Pattern | Muscle Use | Suggests |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Tripod position | Accessory muscles | Severe obstruction (COPD, asthma attack) |
| Abdominal paradox | Diaphragm weakness | Diaphragm fatigue/paralysis |
| Pursed lip breathing | Prolongs expiration | COPD (prevents airway collapse) |
| Nasal flaring | Reduces resistance | Respiratory distress |
| Intercostal retractions | Increased effort | Upper airway obstruction, severe distress |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Elastic Properties:**

**Lung Compliance:**
- Definition: Change in volume per unit change in pressure (ΔV/ΔP)
- Normal: ~200 mL/cm H₂O
- Increased compliance (floppy lungs): Emphysema
- Decreased compliance (stiff lungs): Pulmonary fibrosis, ARDS, pulmonary edema

**Chest Wall Compliance:**
- Also affects breathing effort
- Decreased by: Obesity, kyphoscoliosis, ankylosing spondylitis

**Elastance:**
- Inverse of compliance (1/compliance)
- Stiff lungs have high elastance

**Surface Tension and Surfactant:**
- Alveoli lined with fluid creates surface tension
- Without surfactant, small alveoli would collapse (Laplace's law)
- **Surfactant** (produced by Type II pneumocytes):
  - Reduces surface tension
  - Prevents atelectasis
  - Reduces work of breathing
  - Composition: 90% lipids (DPPC), 10% proteins (SP-A, B, C, D)

**Laplace's Law:**
P = 2T/r
- P = collapsing pressure
- T = surface tension
- r = radius
- Smaller alveoli have greater collapsing pressure
- Surfactant reduces T, equalizing pressure across different-sized alveoli

**Work of Breathing:**
Three components:
1. **Elastic work**: Overcoming lung/chest wall recoil
2. **Resistive work**: Overcoming airway resistance
3. **Inertial work**: Moving tissues (minimal contribution)

Normally 3-5% of total oxygen consumption; increases dramatically in lung disease.

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Airway Resistance:**
- Governed by Poiseuille's Law: R = 8ηL/πr⁴
- Radius is the dominant factor (r⁴)
- 50% halving of radius → 16x increase in resistance
- Medium-sized bronchi (~2mm) contribute most resistance
- Total cross-sectional area increases distally, reducing velocity

**Control of Airway Diameter:**
| Factor | Effect | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Parasympathetic (vagus) | Bronchoconstriction | M3 muscarinic receptors |
| Sympathetic (β2) | Bronchodilation | Smooth muscle relaxation |
| Histamine, leukotrienes | Bronchoconstriction | Inflammation mediators |
| Cold air, irritants | Bronchoconstriction | Vagal reflex |
| Lung volume | Bronchodilation | Radial traction |

**Dynamic Airway Compression:**
- During forced expiration, positive pleural pressure compresses airways
- Equal pressure point: Where airway pressure equals pleural pressure
- Flow limitation occurs downstream (toward mouth)
- In COPD, loss of elastic recoil moves equal pressure point into smaller airways → air trapping

**Time Constants:**
τ = Resistance × Compliance
- Determines how quickly lung units fill/empty
- Inhomogeneous ventilation when time constants differ between regions
- Important in mechanical ventilation settings

**Respiratory System Mechanics:**

**Equation of Motion:**
P = (V × E) + (V̇ × R) + PEEP

Where:
- P = pressure needed to inflate lungs
- V = volume
- E = elastance
- V̇ = flow
- R = resistance
- PEEP = positive end-expiratory pressure

**Pressure-Volume Curves:**
- Hysteresis: Inspiration and expiration curves differ
- Lower inflection point: Recruitment of collapsed alveoli
- Upper inflection point: Overdistension begins
- Critical for ARDS ventilator management

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Diaphragm innervation**: "C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive"
2. **Accessory muscle use**: Sign of respiratory distress, not normal breathing
3. **Pursed lip breathing**: Patients with COPD do this to prevent airway collapse
4. **Paradoxical breathing**: Indicates diaphragm weakness/fatigue - concerning sign
5. **Work of breathing**: Significantly increased in obstructive and restrictive diseases

## Summary

Normal breathing is a carefully orchestrated process involving the respiratory muscles, elastic properties of the lungs and chest wall, and pressure gradients. Understanding these mechanics is essential for diagnosing respiratory disorders and managing patients on mechanical ventilation.
