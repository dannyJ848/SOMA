# Gas Exchange

## Overview
Gas exchange is the primary function of the lungs - transferring oxygen from inhaled air into the blood and removing carbon dioxide from the blood into exhaled air. This occurs at the alveolar-capillary membrane, where blood and air come within 0.5 micrometers of each other across an enormous surface area of approximately 70 square meters.

## The Process of Gas Exchange

### Level 1: Foundation
Your lungs work like a gas station for your blood:

**What happens:**
1. You breathe in air containing oxygen
2. Blood arrives at your lungs low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide (waste gas)
3. In tiny air sacs called **alveoli**, the swap happens:
   - Oxygen moves from air → blood
   - Carbon dioxide moves from blood → air
4. You breathe out, getting rid of the carbon dioxide
5. Oxygen-rich blood travels to your body

**Why it works:**
- Gases naturally move from areas of high concentration to low concentration
- This is called **diffusion** - no energy required
- Your blood vessels are so thin at the alveoli that gases can easily cross

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**The Alveolar-Capillary Unit:**

**Components:**
- **Alveolar epithelium**: Type I cells (gas exchange) and Type II cells (surfactant)
- **Basement membranes**: Alveolar and capillary (may be fused)
- **Capillary endothelium**: Single cell layer
- **Total thickness**: 0.2-0.5 micrometers

**Gas Pressures:**

| Gas | Atmospheric Air | Alveolar Air | Pulmonary Artery | Pulmonary Vein |
|-----|-----------------|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| O₂ (mmHg) | 159 | 100 | 40 | 100 |
| CO₂ (mmHg) | 0.3 | 40 | 46 | 40 |

**Diffusion Direction:**
- O₂: High in alveoli (100 mmHg) → Low in blood (40 mmHg) = INTO blood
- CO₂: High in blood (46 mmHg) → Low in alveoli (40 mmHg) = OUT of blood

**Fick's Law of Diffusion:**
The rate of gas transfer depends on:
- Surface area (larger = faster)
- Membrane thickness (thinner = faster)
- Pressure gradient (greater difference = faster)
- Gas solubility (more soluble = faster)

CO₂ diffuses 20x faster than O₂ due to higher solubility.

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Oxygen Transport:**

**Dissolved O₂:**
- Only 1.5% of total oxygen
- 0.003 mL O₂ per dL blood per mmHg PaO₂

**Hemoglobin-bound O₂:**
- 98.5% of total oxygen
- Each hemoglobin binds 4 O₂ molecules
- 1 gram Hb carries 1.34 mL O₂ when fully saturated

**Oxygen Content Equation:**
CaO₂ = (1.34 × Hb × SaO₂) + (0.003 × PaO₂)

Example with Hb 15 g/dL, SaO₂ 98%, PaO₂ 100:
CaO₂ = (1.34 × 15 × 0.98) + (0.003 × 100) = 19.7 + 0.3 = 20 mL O₂/dL

**Oxyhemoglobin Dissociation Curve:**

Sigmoidal (S-shaped) curve showing relationship between PaO₂ and O₂ saturation.

| PaO₂ (mmHg) | SaO₂ (%) | Clinical Significance |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| 100 | 98 | Normal arterial blood |
| 60 | 90 | "Knee" of curve - below here, saturation drops rapidly |
| 40 | 75 | Mixed venous blood |
| 27 | 50 | P50 (normal) |

**Shifts in the Curve:**

**Right shift (easier O₂ release to tissues):**
- Increased temperature
- Increased PCO₂ (Bohr effect)
- Decreased pH (acidosis)
- Increased 2,3-DPG

**Left shift (O₂ binds more tightly):**
- Decreased temperature
- Decreased PCO₂
- Increased pH (alkalosis)
- Decreased 2,3-DPG
- Fetal hemoglobin
- Carbon monoxide

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Carbon Dioxide Transport:**

**Three forms:**
1. **Dissolved CO₂**: 7-10%
2. **Carbamino compounds**: 20-30% (bound to Hb and plasma proteins)
3. **Bicarbonate**: 60-70% (main form)

**Bicarbonate Formation:**
CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃ ⇌ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻

- Catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase in RBCs
- HCO₃⁻ exits RBC in exchange for Cl⁻ (chloride shift)
- H⁺ buffered by hemoglobin

**Haldane Effect:**
- Deoxygenated Hb carries more CO₂ than oxygenated Hb
- In tissues: O₂ released, CO₂ uptake enhanced
- In lungs: O₂ bound, CO₂ release enhanced

**Ventilation-Perfusion Matching:**

**V/Q Ratio:**
- Normal V/Q ≈ 0.8 (4 L/min ventilation ÷ 5 L/min perfusion)
- Optimal gas exchange requires matched ventilation and perfusion

**V/Q Mismatch Patterns:**

| Condition | V/Q Ratio | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Dead space | V/Q = ∞ | Pulmonary embolism (ventilation, no perfusion) |
| Shunt | V/Q = 0 | Atelectasis, pneumonia (perfusion, no ventilation) |
| Normal apex | V/Q = 3.0 | Ventilation > perfusion |
| Normal base | V/Q = 0.6 | Perfusion > ventilation |

**West Zones of the Lung:**
- Zone 1 (apex): PA > Pa > Pv (minimal perfusion)
- Zone 2 (middle): Pa > PA > Pv (waterfall effect)
- Zone 3 (base): Pa > Pv > PA (continuous flow)

Zone 1 essentially absent in normal, upright lungs but may appear with:
- Decreased cardiac output
- Positive pressure ventilation

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Hypoxic Pulmonary Vasoconstriction (HPV):**
- Unique to pulmonary circulation (systemic vessels dilate with hypoxia)
- Low alveolar O₂ → vasoconstriction → diverts blood to better-ventilated areas
- Improves V/Q matching
- Mechanism: Inhibition of K⁺ channels → depolarization → Ca²⁺ influx → smooth muscle contraction
- Inhibited by vasodilators, volatile anesthetics

**Causes of Hypoxemia:**

| Mechanism | PaO₂ | A-a Gradient | Response to O₂ | Example |
|-----------|------|--------------|----------------|---------|
| Low FiO₂ | ↓ | Normal | Corrects | High altitude |
| Hypoventilation | ↓ | Normal | Corrects | Opioid overdose |
| V/Q mismatch | ↓ | Elevated | Usually corrects | COPD, asthma |
| Shunt | ↓ | Elevated | Poor response | ARDS, AV malformation |
| Diffusion impairment | ↓ | Elevated | Corrects | Pulmonary fibrosis |

**Alveolar-arterial (A-a) Gradient:**
Normal: 10-15 mmHg (increases 3-4 mmHg per decade after age 20)

A-a gradient = PAO₂ - PaO₂

**Alveolar Gas Equation:**
PAO₂ = FiO₂(Patm - PH₂O) - (PaCO₂/R)

Where:
- FiO₂ = fraction of inspired oxygen
- Patm = atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level)
- PH₂O = water vapor pressure (47 mmHg)
- R = respiratory quotient (typically 0.8)

**Diffusion Capacity (DLCO):**
- Measures ability of lungs to transfer gas across alveolar-capillary membrane
- Uses carbon monoxide (CO) as test gas (very high affinity for Hb)
- Reduced in: Pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, anemia, V/Q mismatch
- Increased in: Pulmonary hemorrhage, polycythemia, left-to-right shunts

**Oxygen Cascade:**
Atmospheric O₂ → Alveolar O₂ → Arterial O₂ → Tissue O₂ → Mitochondrial O₂

Each step represents a decrease in PO₂:
- 159 → 100 → 100 → 40 → 3-5 mmHg

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **SpO₂ 90% = PaO₂ ~60 mmHg**: The cliff of the dissociation curve - below this, saturation drops rapidly
2. **CO₂ diffuses easily**: Rarely limited by diffusion; CO₂ retention usually indicates ventilation failure
3. **Shunt doesn't respond to O₂**: In true shunt, blood never contacts alveolar gas
4. **A-a gradient**: Helps distinguish hypoventilation (normal gradient) from lung disease (elevated)
5. **DLCO**: Uniquely reduced in emphysema (unlike other PFTs) due to alveolar destruction

## Summary

Gas exchange is the ultimate purpose of the respiratory system, relying on the thin alveolar-capillary membrane, efficient oxygen and carbon dioxide transport mechanisms, and proper ventilation-perfusion matching. Understanding these principles is essential for diagnosing and managing respiratory failure and guiding oxygen therapy.
