# Lung Anatomy

## Overview
The lungs are paired organs located in the thoracic cavity that facilitate gas exchange between the blood and the atmosphere. The right lung has three lobes while the left lung has two lobes to accommodate the heart. Together, the lungs contain approximately 480 million alveoli, providing a surface area of about 70 square meters for gas exchange.

## Gross Anatomy

### Level 1: Foundation
Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest that allow you to breathe. Key features:
- **Right lung**: Three sections (lobes) - larger
- **Left lung**: Two sections (lobes) - slightly smaller to make room for your heart
- **Trachea**: The windpipe that brings air to the lungs
- **Bronchi**: Tubes that branch from the trachea into each lung

The lungs are protected by the rib cage and sit on the diaphragm, the main muscle of breathing.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Lung Lobes and Fissures:**

**Right Lung (3 lobes):**
- Upper lobe (superior)
- Middle lobe
- Lower lobe (inferior)
- Separated by horizontal fissure (upper from middle) and oblique fissure (middle/upper from lower)

**Left Lung (2 lobes):**
- Upper lobe (includes lingula - the "tongue-like" projection)
- Lower lobe
- Separated by oblique fissure only

**Bronchial Tree:**
- Trachea divides at carina (T4-T5 level) into:
  - Right main bronchus (wider, shorter, more vertical - foreign bodies favor this side)
  - Left main bronchus (longer, narrower, more horizontal)
- Main bronchi → Lobar bronchi → Segmental bronchi → Smaller airways

**Hilum:**
The root of the lung where structures enter/exit:
- Main bronchus
- Pulmonary artery (deoxygenated blood from heart)
- Pulmonary veins (oxygenated blood to heart)
- Bronchial vessels
- Lymph nodes
- Nerves

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Bronchopulmonary Segments:**
Each lobe is divided into functionally independent segments, each with its own:
- Segmental bronchus
- Segmental artery
- Drainage to intersegmental veins

**Right Lung Segments (10):**
| Lobe | Segments |
|------|----------|
| Upper | Apical, Posterior, Anterior |
| Middle | Lateral, Medial |
| Lower | Superior, Medial basal, Anterior basal, Lateral basal, Posterior basal |

**Left Lung Segments (8-10):**
| Lobe | Segments |
|------|----------|
| Upper | Apicoposterior*, Anterior, Superior lingular, Inferior lingular |
| Lower | Superior, Anteromedial basal*, Lateral basal, Posterior basal |

*Indicates combined segments (some classifications list these separately)

**Clinical Correlations:**
- Aspiration pneumonia: Most common in right lower lobe (superior segment when supine, posterior basal when upright)
- Tumor location determines surgical approach
- Segmentectomy preserves more lung function than lobectomy

**Surface Landmarks:**
- Lung apex extends 2-3 cm above clavicle
- Oblique fissures follow line of 6th rib (T3 spinous process to 6th costochondral junction)
- Horizontal fissure at 4th rib level on right

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Airways:**

**Conducting Zone (no gas exchange):**
- Trachea → Main bronchi → Lobar → Segmental → Subsegmental bronchi
- Bronchioles → Terminal bronchioles
- Contains approximately 16 generations of branching

**Respiratory Zone (gas exchange):**
- Respiratory bronchioles (begin gas exchange)
- Alveolar ducts
- Alveolar sacs
- Alveoli
- Approximately 7 more generations

**Airway Wall Structure:**
| Structure | Cartilage | Smooth Muscle | Epithelium |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Trachea | C-shaped rings | Posterior wall | Pseudostratified ciliated columnar |
| Main bronchi | Plates | Circumferential | Pseudostratified ciliated columnar |
| Bronchioles | None | Prominent | Simple columnar → cuboidal |
| Terminal bronchioles | None | Present | Simple cuboidal, Clara cells |
| Respiratory bronchioles | None | Minimal | Cuboidal with alveoli budding |

**Blood Supply:**
1. **Pulmonary circulation** (gas exchange):
   - Pulmonary arteries carry deoxygenated blood
   - Pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood

2. **Bronchial circulation** (nutritive):
   - Bronchial arteries (from aorta) supply airways and pleura
   - Bronchial veins drain to azygos/hemiazygos systems

**Nerve Supply:**
- Pulmonary plexus (anterior and posterior)
- Parasympathetic (vagus): Bronchoconstriction, increased secretions
- Sympathetic: Bronchodilation, decreased secretions

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Lymphatic Drainage:**
Critical for understanding lung cancer staging:

**Intrapulmonary nodes** → **Hilar (bronchopulmonary) nodes** → **Mediastinal nodes** → **Scalene/supraclavicular nodes**

**Lymph Node Stations (IASLC Classification):**
- Stations 1-4: Superior mediastinal
- Stations 5-6: Aortic
- Stations 7-9: Inferior mediastinal
- Stations 10-14: Hilar and intrapulmonary

N2 disease (ipsilateral mediastinal nodes) significantly affects prognosis and treatment approach.

**Pleura:**
- **Visceral pleura**: Covers lung surface, receives blood from bronchial arteries, no pain sensation
- **Parietal pleura**: Lines thoracic cavity, receives blood from intercostal arteries, has pain sensation
- **Pleural space**: Potential space with ~5-15 mL serous fluid
- **Pleural recesses**: Costodiaphragmatic and costomediastinal recesses (space for lung expansion)

**Development:**
- Lung buds appear at week 4 from foregut endoderm
- Stages: Embryonic → Pseudoglandular → Canalicular → Saccular → Alveolar
- Surfactant production begins around week 24
- Alveolarization continues until age 8

**Anatomic Variations:**
- Accessory fissures (azygos fissure most common)
- Bronchial isomerism (associated with complex cardiac anomalies)
- Tracheal bronchus (pig bronchus) - bronchus arising from trachea

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Foreign body aspiration**: Usually goes to right main bronchus (wider, more vertical)
2. **Pancoast tumor**: Apex tumor causing Horner syndrome and brachial plexus symptoms
3. **Lung cancer**: Most common site is right upper lobe
4. **Pleural effusion**: Fluid collects first in costodiaphragmatic recess
5. **Chest tube placement**: Above rib to avoid intercostal neurovascular bundle

## Summary

Understanding lung anatomy is fundamental to respiratory medicine. The branching airways, bronchopulmonary segments, dual blood supply, and lymphatic drainage all have direct clinical implications for diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases.
