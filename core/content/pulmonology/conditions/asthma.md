# Asthma

## Overview
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by reversible airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and underlying inflammation. It affects approximately 300 million people worldwide and is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. While incurable, asthma is highly manageable with proper treatment and self-management strategies.

## Understanding Asthma

### Level 1: Foundation
Asthma is a lung condition where your airways become swollen, narrow, and produce extra mucus. This makes breathing difficult.

**What happens during asthma:**
- Airways become inflamed (red and swollen)
- Muscles around airways tighten (bronchospasm)
- Extra mucus is produced
- Airways become narrower → harder to breathe

**Common symptoms:**
- Wheezing (whistling sound when breathing)
- Shortness of breath
- Chest tightness
- Coughing (especially at night or early morning)

**Important to know:**
- Asthma is lifelong but controllable
- Symptoms come and go
- Triggers can be identified and avoided
- Medications can prevent and relieve symptoms
- Asthma attacks can be life-threatening if severe

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Types of Asthma:**

| Type | Trigger | Characteristics |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| Allergic (extrinsic) | Allergens (dust, pollen, pets) | Most common; often starts in childhood; elevated IgE |
| Non-allergic (intrinsic) | Exercise, cold air, stress, infections | Adult-onset; normal IgE; harder to treat |
| Occupational | Workplace exposures | Improves away from work |
| Exercise-induced | Physical activity | Symptoms during/after exercise |
| Aspirin-exacerbated | NSAIDs, aspirin | Associated with nasal polyps (Samter's triad) |

**Common Triggers:**
- **Allergens**: Dust mites, pet dander, mold, pollen, cockroach
- **Irritants**: Tobacco smoke, pollution, strong odors, chemicals
- **Respiratory infections**: Colds, flu, sinus infections
- **Weather**: Cold air, humidity changes
- **Exercise**: Especially in cold, dry air
- **Emotions**: Stress, strong emotions, laughing
- **Medications**: Aspirin, NSAIDs, beta-blockers
- **GERD**: Acid reflux can trigger asthma symptoms

**Diagnosis:**
- History of episodic symptoms
- Physical exam (wheezing, prolonged expiration)
- **Spirometry**: Shows obstruction (reduced FEV1/FVC)
- **Bronchodilator response**: ≥12% and 200 mL improvement in FEV1 after inhaled bronchodilator
- **Peak flow variability**: >20% variation supports diagnosis
- **Methacholine challenge**: Airway hyperresponsiveness confirms diagnosis

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Asthma Severity Classification:**

| Severity | Day Symptoms | Night Symptoms | FEV1 | Exacerbations |
|----------|--------------|----------------|------|---------------|
| Intermittent | ≤2 days/week | ≤2 nights/month | ≥80% | 0-1/year |
| Mild persistent | >2 days/week | 3-4 nights/month | ≥80% | ≥2/year |
| Moderate persistent | Daily | >1 night/week | 60-80% | ≥2/year |
| Severe persistent | Throughout day | Often nightly | <60% | ≥2/year |

**Asthma Control Levels:**

Well-Controlled:
- Symptoms ≤2 days/week
- No nighttime awakenings
- No limitation of activities
- SABA use ≤2 days/week
- FEV1 >80% predicted
- 0-1 exacerbations/year

**Treatment Steps (Stepwise Approach):**

**Step 1 (Intermittent):**
- SABA as needed

**Step 2 (Mild persistent):**
- Low-dose ICS daily + SABA as needed
- OR LABA-ICS as needed (for adolescents/adults)

**Step 3:**
- Low-dose ICS-LABA + SABA as needed
- OR medium-dose ICS + SABA as needed

**Step 4:**
- Medium-dose ICS-LABA + SABA as needed

**Step 5:**
- High-dose ICS-LABA
- Consider add-on: Tiotropium, biologics (omalizumab, mepolizumab, etc.)

**Step 6:**
- High-dose ICS-LABA + oral corticosteroids
- Refer to specialist

**Recognizing an Asthma Attack:**

| Severity | Signs | Action |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Mild | Talks in sentences, can lie down, RR slightly elevated | Use reliever, reassess |
| Moderate | Talks in phrases, prefers sitting, RR increased, accessory muscle use | Reliever + seek care |
| Severe | Talks in words, hunched forward, RR >30, HR >120, SpO₂ <90% | Emergency! 911 |
| Life-threatening | Silent chest, cyanosis, confusion, exhaustion | Critical emergency |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Pathophysiology:**

**Two-phase response to triggers:**

1. **Early phase (minutes):**
   - IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation
   - Release of histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins
   - Bronchoconstriction (smooth muscle contraction)
   - Vasodilation and edema

2. **Late phase (4-12 hours):**
   - Eosinophil, T-lymphocyte, basophil recruitment
   - Cytokine release (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13)
   - Prolonged inflammation and bronchospasm
   - Airway hyperresponsiveness

**Structural Changes (Airway Remodeling):**
- Subbasement membrane fibrosis
- Smooth muscle hypertrophy
- Goblet cell hyperplasia (increased mucus)
- Angiogenesis
- Leads to fixed airflow limitation over time

**Key Inflammatory Cells:**

| Cell Type | Role |
|-----------|------|
| Mast cells | Release preformed mediators (histamine, tryptase) |
| Eosinophils | Major source of tissue damage, marker of inflammation |
| T-helper 2 cells | Drive allergic inflammation (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13) |
| Macrophages | Antigen presentation, cytokine release |
| Neutrophils | Predominant in severe, steroid-resistant asthma |

**Phenotypes and Endotypes:**

**Phenotypes (Observable traits):**
- Allergic asthma
- Non-allergic asthma
- Late-onset asthma
- Obesity-related asthma
- Asthma with fixed airflow limitation

**Endotypes (Underlying mechanisms):**
- Type 2 (T2) high: Elevated eosinophils, IgE, respond to steroids/biologics
- Type 2 low: Neutrophilic or paucigranulocytic, steroid-resistant

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Biologic Therapies:**

| Agent | Target | Indication | Biomarker |
|-------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Omalizumab | IgE | Severe allergic asthma | Elevated IgE |
| Mepolizumab, Reslizumab | IL-5 | Severe eosinophilic asthma | Eosinophils ≥300 |
| Benralizumab | IL-5Rα | Severe eosinophilic asthma | Eosinophils ≥300 |
| Dupilumab | IL-4Rα | Moderate-severe type 2 asthma | FeNO or eosinophils |
| Tezepelumab | TSLP | Severe asthma (broad) | T2 high or low |

**Severe Asthma Workup:**
- Confirm diagnosis (spirometry, bronchoprovocation)
- Assess adherence and inhaler technique
- Treat comorbidities (GERD, rhinosinusitis, obesity, anxiety)
- Check environmental exposures
- Biomarker phenotyping (eosinophils, IgE, FeNO)
- Consider alternative diagnoses (VCD, CHF, bronchiectasis)

**Status Asthmaticus Management:**

1. **Immediate:**
   - High-flow oxygen (target SpO₂ 93-95%)
   - Continuous nebulized albuterol + ipratropium
   - Systemic corticosteroids (prednisone 40-60 mg or methylprednisolone IV)
   - IV magnesium sulfate (2g over 20 minutes)

2. **If no response:**
   - IV terbutaline or epinephrine
   - Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation
   - Consider heliox
   - Prepare for intubation

3. **Intubation considerations:**
   - Last resort (high complication rate in asthmatics)
   - Use ketamine for induction (bronchodilator)
   - Permit permissive hypercapnia
   - Prolong expiratory time
   - Watch for auto-PEEP

**Asthma-COPD Overlap (ACO):**
- Features of both asthma and COPD
- Usually older with significant smoking history
- Persistent airflow limitation with significant variability
- Type 2 inflammation may be present
- Treat with ICS-LABA (never LABA alone)

## Self-Management Essentials

**Asthma Action Plan:**
All patients should have a written plan:

**Green Zone (Doing Well):**
- No symptoms
- Peak flow 80-100% of personal best
- Continue maintenance medications

**Yellow Zone (Getting Worse):**
- Symptoms present, nighttime waking
- Peak flow 50-80% of personal best
- Add reliever medication, may need to increase controller
- Contact provider if not improving

**Red Zone (Medical Alert):**
- Severe symptoms, very short of breath
- Peak flow <50% of personal best
- Take reliever, start oral steroids, seek emergency care

---

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Well-controlled asthma**: Patients should have minimal symptoms and rare reliever use
2. **Step down when stable**: After 3 months of good control, consider reducing therapy
3. **Inhaler technique**: Review at every visit - poor technique is a common cause of failure
4. **Flu and pneumonia vaccines**: Recommended for all asthmatics
5. **SABA overuse**: >2 canisters/year associated with increased risk of severe exacerbations

## Summary

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by variable symptoms and airflow limitation. Successful management requires identifying triggers, regular controller medications, proper inhaler technique, and a personalized action plan for recognizing and managing exacerbations.
