# Team Collaboration Models

Effective rehabilitation teams use structured approaches to collaboration, ensuring coordinated and comprehensive patient care.

## Models of Team Interaction

### Multidisciplinary Team
- Each discipline works independently within their scope
- Separate treatment sessions focused on specific goals
- Communication happens through chart notes and occasional meetings
- Patient may receive different messages from different providers

**Advantages**: Clear roles, efficient use of specialist expertise
**Limitations**: Fragmented care, potential for conflicting information

### Interdisciplinary Team
- Regular team meetings to discuss patients
- Shared goals and treatment planning
- Communication occurs frequently and intentionally
- Team members may co-treat or observe each other's sessions
- Patient receives consistent messages from all providers

**Advantages**: Coordinated care, consistent messaging, comprehensive perspective
**Limitations**: Time-intensive, requires strong communication skills

### Transdisciplinary Team
- Team members cross traditional role boundaries
- Extensive sharing of roles and skills
- One team member may address multiple areas in a single session
- Maximum integration of services

**Advantages**: Most efficient, natural integration of skills
**Limitations**: Requires advanced training and trust, can blur professional boundaries

## Team Meeting Structures

### Interdisciplinary Conferences
**Purpose**: Comprehensive review of patient's status and progress

**Typical Participants**:
- Patient and family
- Physiatrist
- Physical therapist
- Occupational therapist
- Speech-language pathologist
- Rehabilitation nurse
- Case manager/social worker
- Other relevant therapists

**Meeting Components**:
1. **Patient and family perspective**: What's important to them?
2. **Medical status**: Updates on health, medications, complications
3. **Therapy updates**: Progress in each discipline
4. **Goal review**: Are current goals appropriate? Are they being met?
5. **Problem-solving**: Addressing barriers and challenges
6. **Discharge planning**: Anticipated needs and timeline
7. **Plan for next phase**: Updated treatment approach

### Bedside Rounds
- Brief, focused meetings at patient's bedside
- Patient more directly involved
- Efficient communication and planning
- May happen daily or several times per week

### Informal Communication
- Conversations in hallways, at the nurse's station
- Quick questions and clarifications
- Maintains coordination between formal meetings
- Requires culture that encourages informal communication

## Communication Strategies

### SBAR Technique
Structured communication prevents miscommunication:

**S - Situation**: What's happening now?
**B - Background**: What led up to this?
**A - Assessment**: What do you think is going on?
**R - Recommendation**: What do you think should be done?

### Goal Attainment Scaling
- Team sets shared goals with patient
- Each goal is scaled from -2 (much less than expected) to +2 (much more than expected)
- All team members work toward same outcomes
- Progress is measured consistently across disciplines

### Shared Documentation
- Electronic health records accessible to all team members
- Treatment plans visible to everyone
- Progress notes from all disciplines in one place
- Reduces duplication and conflicting information

## Role Clarity and Overlap

### Primary Responsibilities

**Physiatrist**: Medical management, overall rehabilitation direction, coordinating medical aspects

**Physical Therapist**: Gross motor function, gait, balance, mobility, pain management, prosthetics/orthotics

**Occupational Therapist**: Fine motor function, ADLs, IADLs, upper body function, perceptual skills, home environment

**Speech-Language Pathologist**: Communication, swallowing, cognitive-communication, auditory comprehension

**Rehabilitation Nurse**: Medical care, bladder/bowel, skin integrity, medication education, health management

**Psychologist**: Emotional adjustment, behavior management, coping strategies, mental health conditions

**Case Manager/Social Worker**: Discharge planning, resource coordination, insurance, family support, community resources

### Appropriate Overlap
Some overlap is intentional and beneficial:
- Both PT and OT address balance and falls
- Both PT and OT do transfers and mobility
- Both PT and OT address home safety
- Both OT and SLP address cognition
- All disciplines address patient education

**Key**: Overlap should be intentional and coordinated, not duplicative

## Collaborative Goal Setting

### Process
1. **Patient identifies priorities**: What matters most to them?
2. **Team offers expertise**: What are realistic possibilities?
3. **Negotiation**: Find alignment between hopes and realities
4. **Documentation**: Clear, measurable goals with timelines
5. **Regular review**: Progress toward goals and adjustments as needed

### SMART Goals
- **Specific**: Clear and unambiguous
- **Measurable**: Can be quantified or observed
- **Achievable**: Within patient's potential
- **Relevant**: Meaningful to patient's life
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline for achievement

### Balancing Perspectives
- Patient's values and preferences are paramount
- Family input is essential (with patient consent)
- Professional expertise guides realistic expectations
- Cultural factors influence goal priorities

# Advanced Team Dynamics

High-functioning rehabilitation teams navigate complex interpersonal dynamics, organizational challenges, and changing healthcare environments.

## Team Development Stages

### Forming
- Team members are polite and tentative
- Unclear about roles, goals, and processes
- Look to leadership for guidance
- Establishing trust and safety

### Storming
- Conflict emerges as differences become apparent
- Power struggles and disagreements about approaches
- Communication may break down
- This stage is normal and necessary for development

**Key**: Don't avoid conflict - address it directly and constructively

### Norming
- Team establishes shared expectations and processes
- Roles and responsibilities are clarified
- Trust develops through reliable interactions
- Communication patterns become established

### Performing
- Team works efficiently and effectively
- Members anticipate each other's needs
- Shared mental model guides decision-making
- High-quality collaboration is routine

### Adjourning/Transforming
- Team composition changes (staff turnover, patient discharge)
- Team must re-form with new members
- Established culture helps rapid re-development

## Leadership in Rehabilitation Teams

### Types of Leadership

**Positional Leadership**
- Formal authority (medical director, team leader)
- Responsible for administrative and clinical oversight
- Makes decisions when consensus can't be reached
- Accountable for team performance

**Clinical Leadership**
- Based on expertise rather than position
- Any team member can demonstrate clinical leadership
- Guides treatment approaches through knowledge
- Earned through competence and credibility

**Shared Leadership**
- Different members lead in different situations
- Most appropriate for complex, interdependent work
- Requires high level of trust and communication
- Maximizes use of team expertise

### Effective Leadership Behaviors

**Facilitation**
- Ensures all voices are heard
- Guides discussion without dominating
- Helps team process information and make decisions
- Creates environment for constructive conflict

**Communication**
- Clear, direct, and respectful
- Listens more than speaks
- Shares information transparently
- Provides regular feedback

**Decision-Making**
- Knows when to decide vs. when to involve team
- Makes decisions with insufficient information when needed
- Explains reasoning for decisions
- Reverses decisions when new information emerges

**Conflict Management**
- Addresses conflict directly rather than avoiding
- Helps team members understand different perspectives
- Finds solutions that address underlying interests
- Maintains relationships while addressing problems

## Managing Team Conflict

### Sources of Conflict

**Role Ambiguity**
- Unclear who is responsible for what
- Overlap between disciplines not addressed
- Changes in scope of practice

**Treatment Philosophy Differences**
- Different approaches to similar problems
- Disagreement about what's best for patient
- Varying tolerance for risk

**Resource Limitations**
- Competition for limited equipment or space
- Differing priorities about resource allocation
- Perceived unfairness in distribution

**Personality Differences**

- Work style and pace

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

**Collaborating**
- Work together to find solution that satisfies all
- Most appropriate for important issues with multiple valid perspectives
- Time-intensive but produces best outcomes
- Preserves relationships and addresses underlying concerns

**Compromising**
- Each party gives up something
- Appropriate when both positions have merit
- Faster than collaborating but less satisfying
- May leave underlying issues unresolved

**Accommodating**
- One party yields to another
- Appropriate for issues more important to one party
- Can build goodwill for future conflicts
- Risk of resentment if overused

**Competing**
- One party's position prevails
- Appropriate for urgent situations or when safety is at stake
- Fast but damages relationships
- Should be used sparingly

**Avoiding**
- Issue not addressed directly
- Sometimes appropriate for trivial issues
- Allows emotions to cool when high
- Risks problem worsening over time

### Constructive Conflict
- Focus on problems, not people
- Use specific examples rather than generalizations
- Express own perspective without attacking others
- Seek to understand others' viewpoints
- Find shared interests beneath positions

## Interprofessional Education (IPE)

### Learning Together, Working Together
- Students from different professions learn with, from, and about each other
- Develops understanding of roles and responsibilities
- Builds communication and teamwork skills
- Improves future collaborative practice

### Competencies for Interprofessional Practice
1. **Values/Ethics**: Work with team to maintain respect and shared values
2. **Roles/Responsibilities**: Use knowledge of own and others' roles
3. **Communication**: Communicate with teams in ways that support team functioning
4. **Teams and Teamwork**: Apply relationship-building values and team functioning

## Team-Based Care Models

# Team Leadership and Systems Integration

Mastery of rehabilitation team leadership requires understanding complex healthcare systems, emerging models of care, and strategies for continuous improvement.

## Systems-Based Practice

### Understanding Healthcare Systems
Rehabilitation operates within multiple intersecting systems:

**Payment Systems**
- Fee-for-service: Payment for each service provided
- Bundled payments: Single payment for episode of care
- Capitation: Fixed payment per patient regardless of services
- Value-based care: Payment tied to outcomes and quality

**Implications for practice**:
- Different incentives affect treatment decisions
- Documentation requirements vary
- Length of stay may be determined by payment
- Resource allocation changes based on reimbursement

**Regulatory Systems**
- Joint Commission standards for hospital accreditation
- CMS Conditions of Participation for Medicare reimbursement
- State licensing requirements for facilities and professionals
- Professional practice acts for each discipline

**Delivery Systems**
- Academic medical centers: Teaching, research, specialized care
- Community hospitals: Local access, general rehabilitation
- Freestanding rehabilitation hospitals: Focused rehabilitation care
- Skilled nursing facilities: Subacute rehabilitation
- Home health: Home-based rehabilitation services
- Outpatient clinics: Community-based services

### Transitions of Care

**Hand-off Communication**
- Structured communication at transfer points
- Essential information: What happened, what's planned, what to watch for
- Both sending and receiving facilities have responsibilities
- Patient and family included in communication

**Medication Reconciliation**
- Compare medications across different settings
- Identify discrepancies and resolve them
- Educate patient and family about medications
- Reduce adverse drug events

**Care Coordination**
- Arrange follow-up appointments before discharge
- Order and arrange equipment
- Provide discharge summaries to receiving providers
- Ensure patient and family understand the plan

## Quality Improvement

### Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) Cycles
**Plan**: Identify problem, plan intervention, set measures
**Do**: Implement on small scale
**Study**: Measure results, compare to predictions
**Act**: Adopt, adapt, or abandon based on results

### Quality Metrics in Rehabilitation
**Process Measures**
- Are evidence-based practices being delivered?
- Examples: Early mobilization after stroke, fall assessments
- Relatively easy to measure
- Don't guarantee good outcomes

**Outcome Measures**
- Are patients improving?
- Examples: Functional Independence Measure (FIM), gait speed
- More difficult to interpret (multiple factors affect outcomes)
- More directly meaningful to patients

**Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)
- Patient's perspective on their health status
- Examples: Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), quality of life measures
- Increasingly important in value-based care
- Must be feasible and not burdensome

### High-Reliability Organizations
Characteristics of highly reliable healthcare systems:
- Preoccupation with failure: Identify problems before they cause harm
- Reluctance to simplify: Resist easy explanations
- Sensitivity to operations: Frontline staff understand current work
- Commitment to resilience: Maintain safety despite unexpected events
- Deference to expertise: Leaders defer to those with knowledge, not position

## Value-Based Rehabilitation

### Triple Aim
1. **Improve the health of populations**
2. **Enhance the patient experience of care**
3. **Reduce the per capita cost of healthcare**

### Implementing Value-Based Care
**Standardized Care Pathways**
- Evidence-based protocols for common conditions
- Reduce unwanted variation in care
- Improve efficiency and outcomes
- Allow for individualization when appropriate

**Risk Stratification**
- Identify patients at high risk for poor outcomes
- Provide additional resources and attention
- Prevent complications and readmissions
- Match intensity of intervention to risk level

**Population Health Management**
- Focus on defined population (e.g., all stroke patients in a region)
- Identify needs across continuum
- Coordinate services across settings
- Address social determinants of health

## Team Resilience and Well-being

### Burnout Prevention
**Individual strategies**:
- Self-awareness of burnout symptoms
- Stress management techniques
- Maintaining work-life balance
- Finding meaning in work

**Organizational strategies**:
- Adequate staffing and resources
- Efficient workflow processes
- Supportive leadership
- Recognition and appreciation
- Professional development opportunities

### Moral Injury and Resilience
**Moral injury**: Psychological distress from situations that violate moral code
- Inability to provide care you believe is right
- System constraints prevent best practice
- Witnessing suffering without ability to help

**Building resilience**:
- Peer support and debriefing
- Reflective practice
- Ethics consultation
- Advocacy for system change

### Building Resilient Teams
- Psychological safety: Team members can speak up without fear
- Debriefing after difficult events
- Celebration of successes
- Open discussion of challenges
- Mutual support

## Emerging Team Models

### Telehealth Rehabilitation
- Virtual visits expand access to rehabilitation services
- Requires adaptation of assessment and treatment techniques
- Technology considerations for both providers and patients
- Regulatory and payment considerations

### Remote Monitoring
- Wearable sensors track activity and progress
