      summary: 'Home modification practice integrates environmental assessment frameworks, universal design principles, and funding navigation to systematically address person-environment fit and support aging in place or community reintegration.',
      explanation: `## Theoretical Framework

**Person-Environment-Occupation (PEO) Model:**
Home modifications address the environment component to improve occupational performance fit:
- Reduce environmental demands
- Match environment to person's capacities
- Enable occupation despite limitations

**Environmental Press Model (Lawton):**
- Optimal function occurs when environmental demands match personal competence
- As competence decreases, environmental adaptation becomes critical
- Too much or too little demand impairs function

## Assessment Frameworks

**Comprehensive Home Assessment:**

*Safety Assessment:*

- Electrical outlet locations

**Standardized Tools:**
| Tool | Focus | Format |
|------|-------|--------|
| Home Safety Self-Assessment (HSSA) | Safety hazards | Checklist |
| SAFER-HOME | Fall risk, function | Observation |
| Housing Enabler | Accessibility barriers | Measurement |
| Westmead Home Safety Assessment | Falls prevention | Interview/observation |
