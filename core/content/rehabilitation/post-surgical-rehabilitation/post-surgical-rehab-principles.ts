      summary: 'After surgery, rehabilitation helps you heal properly and get back to your normal activities safely.',

      summary: 'Post-surgical rehabilitation follows tissue healing timelines and surgical precautions to safely restore function while protecting surgical repairs.',
      explanation: `Post-surgical rehabilitation is designed around wound healing biology and specific surgical procedures.

**Phases of Wound Healing:**

      summary: 'Post-surgical rehabilitation protocols are designed around tissue healing biology, surgical fixation stability, and evidence-based progression criteria to optimize functional recovery while minimizing complication risk.',
      explanation: `## Tissue Healing Principles

**Collagen Maturation:**
- Initial collagen is weak type III
- Gradual replacement with stronger type I
- Full strength at 12-16 weeks for most tissues
- Stress promotes organized healing (Wolff's Law)

**Healing by Tissue Type:**

| Tissue | Initial Healing | Full Strength |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| Skin | 2-3 weeks | 6-8 weeks |
| Muscle | 3-4 weeks | 6-12 weeks |
| Tendon | 4-8 weeks | 12-16 weeks |
| Ligament | 4-8 weeks | 12-24 weeks |
| Bone | 6-8 weeks | 12-16 weeks |
| Cartilage | 8-12 weeks | 12-24+ weeks |

## Surgical Considerations

- Balance and proprioception
- Cardiovascular conditioning

**Phase IV: Return to Activity (Weeks 12+)**
- Sport/work-specific training
- High-level functional activities
