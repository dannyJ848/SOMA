      summary: 'Aphasia rehabilitation helps people who have difficulty speaking, understanding, reading, or writing after brain injury or stroke.',
      explanation: `Aphasia is when someone has trouble with language after damage to the brain, usually from a stroke. Aphasia rehabilitation helps people regain language abilities and learn new ways to communicate.

**What is aphasia?**
- Trouble finding the right words to say
- Difficulty understanding what others say
- Problems with reading or writing
- The person still thinks and knows what they want to say, but the words won't come out right

**What aphasia is NOT:**
- It's not a problem with intelligence
- It's not a mental illness
- It's not a problem with hearing

**How does therapy help?**
1. **Practice exercises**: Repeating words, naming pictures, following directions
2. **Communication strategies**: Using gestures, drawing, or technology
3. **Conversation practice**: Real-life communication situations
4. **Family involvement**: Teaching loved ones how to communicate better

**Recovery from aphasia:**
- The brain can heal and change
- Most improvement happens in the first few months
- Progress can continue for years
- Every person's recovery is different

With practice, support, and patience, many people with aphasia make significant improvements in their communication abilities.`,
