      summary: 'Dysarthria treatment helps people whose speech is unclear because of weakness or coordination problems in the muscles used for speaking.',
      explanation: `Dysarthria happens when the muscles you use for speaking are weak, slow, or don't work together well. This makes speech sound slurred, quiet, or hard to understand. A speech therapist can help.

**What causes dysarthria?**
- Stroke
- Brain injury
- Parkinson's disease
- Multiple sclerosis
- Other conditions affecting the brain or nerves

**How does dysarthria affect speech?**
- Speech may sound slurred or mumbled
- Voice may be too quiet or too loud
- Speaking may be too fast or too slow
- Voice may sound hoarse or breathy

**How does therapy help?**
1. **Exercises**: Strengthen the muscles of the tongue, lips, and face
2. **Strategies**: Learn to slow down, speak louder, or pause between words
3. **Practice**: Work on clear pronunciation
4. **Technology**: Use devices that can amplify your voice

**Tips for better communication:**
- Face the listener
- Speak in short phrases
- Check that the listener understands
- Reduce background noise

With practice and the right strategies, many people with dysarthria can communicate more effectively.`,
