      summary: 'Voice therapy helps people whose voice sounds different than usual or causes pain when speaking.',
      explanation: `Voice therapy helps when something is wrong with how your voice sounds or feels. A speech therapist who specializes in voice can help you learn to use your voice in healthier ways.

**Signs of voice problems:**
- Hoarse or raspy voice
- Voice that tires easily
- Losing your voice often
- Pain or strain when talking
- Voice that sounds too high, low, or breathy

**What causes voice problems?**
- Using your voice too much or too harshly
- Growths on the vocal cords (nodules, polyps)
- Nerve problems affecting the voice
- Acid reflux irritating the throat
- Breathing problems

**How does voice therapy help?**
1. **Learn healthy habits**: Stay hydrated, don't yell, rest your voice
2. **Breathing exercises**: Use your breath to support your voice
3. **Voice exercises**: Practice making sounds in new, healthier ways
4. **Reduce strain**: Learn to talk without pushing or straining

**Voice care tips:**
- Drink plenty of water
- Avoid yelling or whispering
- Don't clear your throat constantly
- Limit caffeine and alcohol
- Avoid smoky environments

With practice and good habits, many voice problems can be improved or resolved through therapy.`,
