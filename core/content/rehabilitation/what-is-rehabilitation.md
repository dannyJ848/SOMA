# What is Rehabilitation Medicine?

## Overview
Rehabilitation medicine helps people recover from illness, injury, or surgery. The goal is to restore function, independence, and quality of life. Rehabilitation is a journey that requires teamwork between you and your care team.

## Goals of Rehabilitation

### Level 1 - Basic Understanding
Rehabilitation helps you get better after an illness or injury. The goal is to help you do things on your own again. Your team will work with you to improve your strength, movement, and daily activities.

### Level 2 - Foundational Knowledge
**Main goals of rehabilitation:**
- Restore lost function and abilities
- Prevent further complications
- Reduce pain and discomfort
- Increase independence in daily activities
- Improve quality of life

Your rehabilitation program is designed just for you based on your specific needs and what you want to achieve.

### Level 3 - Intermediate Understanding
**Rehabilitation goals are organized by timeframes:**

**Short-term goals (days to weeks):**
- Manage pain effectively
- Prevent complications (blood clots, pressure sores)
- Begin basic movements
- Understand your condition

**Medium-term goals (weeks to months):**
- Regain strength and endurance
- Learn new ways to complete tasks
- Use assistive devices safely
- Participate in therapy sessions

**Long-term goals (months to years):**
- Return to work or school
- Resume hobbies and social activities
- Live as independently as possible
- Maintain gains achieved

### Level 4 - Advanced Understanding
**Goal-setting framework in rehabilitation:**

**SMART Goals:**
- **S**pecific: Clear, well-defined objectives
- **M**easurable: Quantifiable progress indicators
- **A**chievable: Realistic given your condition
- **R**elevant: Meaningful to your life
- **T**ime-bound: Set within specific timeframes

**Functional domains addressed:**
| Domain | Examples |
|--------|----------|
| Mobility | Walking, transfers, stairs |
| Self-care | Bathing, dressing, eating |

Goals are regularly reviewed and adjusted based on your progress, changing needs, and new challenges that arise.

### Level 5 - Comprehensive Knowledge
**Evidence-based goal-setting in rehabilitation medicine:**

**International Classification of Functioning (ICF) Framework:**
- Body functions and structures
- Activities (task execution)
- Participation (life situations)
- Environmental factors
- Personal factors

**Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS):**
Uses standardized scoring to measure individual goal achievement:
- -2: Much worse than expected
- -1: Somewhat worse than expected
- 0: Expected outcome achieved
- +1: Somewhat better than expected
- +2: Much better than expected

**Neuroplasticity principles guiding goals:**
- Task-specific practice
- Repetition and intensity
- Salience and motivation
- Timing of interventions
- Cross-modal plasticity

**Outcome measurement tools:**
- Functional Independence Measure (FIM)
- Barthel Index
- Modified Rankin Scale
- Quality of life assessments (SF-36)

## Types of Rehabilitation Settings

### Level 1 - Basic Understanding
Rehabilitation can happen in different places:
- **Hospital**: For people who need a lot of help
- **Rehab center**: A special place just for rehabilitation
- **Outpatient clinic**: You visit for therapy and go home
- **Home**: Therapists come to your house

The right place depends on how much help you need.

### Level 2 - Foundational Knowledge
**Rehabilitation settings explained:**

**Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF):**
- Stay in the hospital for intensive therapy
- Receive at least 3 hours of therapy daily
- Best for people who need close medical supervision
- Typical stay: 2-3 weeks

**Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF):**
- For people who need nursing care and some therapy
- Less intensive than IRF
- Typical stay: weeks to months

**Outpatient Rehabilitation:**
- Go to a clinic for therapy sessions
- Return home after each visit
- Good for people who are medically stable
- Sessions typically 2-3 times per week

**Home Health:**
- Therapists come to your home
- Good for people who have difficulty traveling
- Combines with outpatient as you improve

### Level 3 - Intermediate Understanding
**Detailed comparison of rehabilitation settings:**

| Setting | Intensity | Supervision | Duration | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Acute care hospital | Low | 24-hour medical | Days | Initial stabilization |
| Inpatient rehab (IRF) | High (3+ hours/day) | 24-hour nursing | 2-4 weeks | Stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury |
| Skilled nursing (SNF) | Moderate | 24-hour nursing | Weeks-months | Elderly, complex medical needs |
| Long-term acute care (LTAC) | Low-moderate | 24-hour medical | Weeks-months | Ventilator weaning, complex medical |
| Outpatient | Variable | None | Ongoing | Community-dwelling, stable |
| Home health | Low-moderate | None | Weeks-months | Homebound patients |
| Day rehabilitation | Moderate | Day only | Weeks-months | Need structure but not overnight |

**Factors determining placement:**
- Medical stability and nursing needs
