      summary:
        'The female reproductive system makes eggs, provides a place for a baby to grow, and produces hormones that control the menstrual cycle.',
      explanation: `The female reproductive system has several parts that work together to make pregnancy possible and support a growing baby.

**The Main Parts:**

**1. Ovaries**
- Two almond-sized organs in the lower belly
- Store eggs (also called ova)
- Make hormones estrogen and progesterone
- Release one egg each month (ovulation)

**2. Fallopian Tubes**
- Two thin tubes connecting ovaries to uterus
- Finger-like ends (fimbriae) catch the released egg
- Where the egg meets sperm to make a baby
- Tiny hairs move the egg toward the uterus

**3. Uterus (Womb)**
- Pear-shaped organ where baby grows during pregnancy
- Thick muscular walls
- Inner lining (endometrium) thickens each month
- If no pregnancy, lining sheds as menstrual period

**4. Cervix**
- Bottom part of uterus, like a doorway
- Opens to the vagina
- Makes mucus that changes during the month
- Opens wide during childbirth

**5. Vagina**
- Muscular tube from cervix to outside the body
- Where penis enters during sex
- Birth canal for baby
- Where menstrual blood comes out

**6. Breasts**
- Contain mammary glands that make milk after childbirth
- Fat, tissue, and milk ducts
- Nipple where milk comes out
- Develop during puberty

**The Menstrual Cycle (Period):**
- About once a month (every 28 days on average)
- Uterus prepares for possible pregnancy
- If no pregnancy, lining sheds as blood (period lasts 3-7 days)
- Cycle starts over again

**Spanish Translation (Traducción al español):**
- Ovaries = Ovarios
- Fallopian tubes = Trompas de Falopio
- Uterus = Útero/Matriz
- Vagina = Vagina
- Breasts = Senos/Mamas
- Menstruation = Menstruación/Regla`,

      summary:
        'The female reproductive system consists of internal organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, vagina) and external structures (vulva, breasts) that coordinate ovulation, fertilization, pregnancy, and lactation.',
      explanation: `The female reproductive system has internal and external components coordinated by hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries.

**Internal Structures:**

**Ovaries**
- Paired organs (3-4 cm long, almond-shaped) in pelvic cavity
- Suspended by: mesovarium (broad ligament), suspensory ligament (ovarian vessels), ovarian ligament (to uterus)
- **Cortex**: Contains follicles at various developmental stages
- **Medulla**: Contains blood vessels, nerves, lymphatics
- Functions: Oogenesis (egg production), steroidogenesis (estrogen, progesterone)
- Before birth: ~1-2 million oocytes; by puberty: ~400,000 remain
- One dominant follicle matures monthly, releases secondary oocyte (ovulation)

**Fallopian Tubes (Oviducts)**
- Paired tubes (~10 cm long) extending from uterus toward ovaries
- Four parts: **Infundibulum** (funnel-shaped opening with fimbriae), **Ampulla** (widest, usual fertilization site), **Isthmus** (narrow segment), **Intramural portion** (within uterine wall)
- Ciliated columnar epithelium plus smooth muscle
- Cilia and peristalsis transport oocyte toward uterus
- Provide optimal environment for fertilization

**Uterus**
- Pear-shaped muscular organ (~7.5 cm long, 5 cm wide in nulliparous women)
- Position: Anteflexed and anteverted between bladder and rectum
- Three parts: **Fundus** (top, above tubal openings), **Body** (main portion), **Cervix** (lower neck)
- Three layers:
  1. **Perimetrium**: Outer serous layer (peritoneum)
  2. **Myometrium**: Thick smooth muscle layer (contracts during labor)
  3. **Endometrium**: Inner mucosa, two zones:
     - Functional layer (stratum functionalis): Sheds during menstruation
     - Basal layer (stratum basalis): Regenerates functional layer
- Blood supply: Uterine artery (from internal iliac), ovarian artery

**Cervix**
- Cylindrical structure (~2.5-3 cm long)
- **External os**: Opens to vagina (nulliparous: circular; multiparous: slit-like)
- **Cervical canal**: Lined with columnar epithelium producing mucus
- **Internal os**: Opens to uterine cavity
- **Transformation zone**: Junction of ectocervix (squamous) and endocervix (columnar) - most common site for cervical cancer
- Cervical mucus: Changes throughout cycle (thick/scant → thin/stretchy at ovulation)

**Vagina**
- Fibromuscular tube (~7-10 cm long)
- Extends from cervix to vestibule
- Stratified squamous epithelium (no glands)
- Acidic pH (3.8-4.5) from lactobacilli metabolizing glycogen
- Functions: Copulation, birth canal, menstrual flow passage
- Rugae (folds) allow expansion

**External Genitalia (Vulva):**
- **Mons pubis**: Fatty tissue over pubic bone
- **Labia majora**: Outer folds (homologous to scrotum)
- **Labia minora**: Inner folds
- **Clitoris**: Erectile tissue (homologous to penis), has glans and two corpora cavernosa
- **Vestibule**: Area between labia minora containing urethral and vaginal openings
- **Bartholin's glands**: Mucus-secreting glands at posterior vestibule
- **Hymen**: Thin membrane partially covering vaginal opening

**Breasts (Mammary Glands):**
- Modified sweat glands
- 15-20 lobes, each with lactiferous duct opening at nipple
- Lobes contain lobules (alveoli) that produce milk
- Stromal tissue (fat, connective tissue) determines size
- **Areola**: Pigmented area around nipple, contains Montgomery glands (sebaceous)
- Supported by Cooper's ligaments (suspensory)
- Lymphatic drainage: Primarily axillary nodes (important for breast cancer staging)

**The Menstrual Cycle:**
- Average 28 days (normal range: 21-35 days)
- **Follicular phase** (days 1-14): FSH stimulates follicle growth, estrogen rises, endometrium proliferates
- **Ovulation** (day 14): LH surge triggers egg release
- **Luteal phase** (days 15-28): Corpus luteum produces progesterone, endometrium becomes secretory
- If no pregnancy: Progesterone drops → menstruation

      summary:
        'The female reproductive system integrates folliculogenesis, hormonal regulation, and tissue remodeling through the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and endometrial-myometrial coordination.',
      explanation: `The female reproductive system demonstrates complex integration of neuroendocrine signaling, gametogenesis, and mechanical functions.

**Ovarian Anatomy and Folliculogenesis:**

**Ovarian Structure:**
- **Cortex**: Dense connective tissue containing follicles at various stages
- **Medulla**: Loose connective tissue with helicine arteries, veins, nerves
- **Surface epithelium**: Simple cuboidal/squamous (germinal epithelium, misnomer as doesn't produce germ cells)
- **Tunica albuginea**: Thin fibrous capsule beneath surface epithelium

**Follicular Development:**
1. **Primordial follicles**: Oocyte arrested in prophase I + single layer flat granulosa cells
2. **Primary follicles**: Cuboidal granulosa cells, zona pellucida forms around oocyte
3. **Secondary (preantral) follicles**: Multiple granulosa layers, theca interna/externa develop
4. **Tertiary (antral/Graafian) follicles**: Antrum (fluid-filled cavity) forms, cumulus oophorus, corona radiata

**Ovarian Steroidogenesis - Two-Cell, Two-Gonadotropin Model:**
- **Theca interna cells**: Express LH receptors, produce androgens (androstenedione, testosterone)
- **Granulosa cells**: Express FSH receptors, contain aromatase enzyme
- Aromatase converts theca-derived androgens → estradiol
- Dominant follicle develops LH receptors on granulosa cells
- After ovulation, granulosa + theca luteinize → corpus luteum (progesterone production)

**Ovulation:**
- LH surge (in response to high estradiol) triggers:
  - Meiosis resumption (completion of meiosis I → secondary oocyte + first polar body)
  - Cumulus expansion (hyaluronic acid matrix)
  - Proteolytic enzyme activation (collagenase, plasmin)
  - Prostaglandin synthesis
  - Follicle rupture ~34-36 hours after LH surge onset

**Fallopian Tube Histology:**
- **Mucosa**: Ciliated columnar epithelium (propels oocyte) + peg cells (secretory, nourish gametes/embryo)
- **Muscularis**: Inner circular, outer longitudinal smooth muscle
- **Serosa**: Peritoneum
- Fertilization typically in ampulla within 12-24 hours of ovulation
- Zygote travels to uterus over 3-5 days, enters as morula/early blastocyst

**Uterine Structure and Cycle:**

**Endometrial Cycle:**
- **Menstrual phase** (days 1-5): Spiral arteriole spasm → ischemia → shedding of functional layer
- **Proliferative phase** (days 6-14): Estrogen-driven regeneration from basal layer
  - Glands straight, stroma compact
  - Epithelial cell proliferation, spiral arteriole growth
- **Secretory phase** (days 15-28): Progesterone-dominant transformation
  - Glands become tortuous, coiled ("saw-tooth" pattern)
  - Stromal edema, decidualization begins
  - Glycogen accumulation in glands
  - **Window of implantation**: Days 20-24 (LH+6 to LH+10)

**Myometrial Function:**
- Three muscle layers: Inner/outer longitudinal, middle circular (vascular layer)
- Quiescent during pregnancy (progesterone dominance)
- Contracts during labor: Gap junction formation, oxytocin/prostaglandin signaling
- Postpartum contractions aid hemostasis

**Cervical Mucus Dynamics:**
- **Follicular phase**: Estrogen → thin, watery, alkaline, high water content (98%), ferning pattern
- **Luteal phase**: Progesterone → thick, viscous, acidic, cellular, low water content (90%)
- Spinnbarkeit: Stretchability of mucus (~10 cm at ovulation)

**Breast Anatomy:**
- **Lobes** (15-20): Glandular tissue organized radially
- **Lobules**: Terminal ductulo-lobular units (TDLUs) - milk production sites
- **Lactiferous ducts**: Converge at nipple, dilate beneath areola (lactiferous sinuses)
- **Stroma**: Adipose (determines size) + fibrous (Cooper's ligaments)
- **Lymphatic drainage**: 75% lateral breast → axillary nodes (levels I-III); 25% medial → internal mammary
- **Cyclic changes**: Estrogen stimulates duct growth, progesterone stimulates lobular development
- **Lactation**: Prolactin stimulates milk synthesis, oxytocin stimulates ejection

**Vascular Supply:**
- **Ovarian artery**: From abdominal aorta (L2)
- **Uterine artery**: From internal iliac, anastomoses with ovarian artery
- **Vaginal artery**: From internal iliac
- **Pudendal artery**: External genitalia
- Venous drainage parallels arterial supply

      summary:
        'The female reproductive system orchestrates complex molecular cascades including gonadotropin signaling, steroid hormone synthesis, oocyte maturation, and endometrial receptivity through paracrine and endocrine mechanisms.',
      explanation: `Advanced understanding requires integration of molecular signaling, genetics, and clinical pathophysiology.

**Molecular Regulation of Folliculogenesis:**

**Primordial to Primary Transition (Gonadotropin-Independent):**
- Local paracrine factors: Kit ligand (from granulosa), GDF-9, BMP-15 (from oocyte)
- **Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)**: Produced by granulosa cells of preantral/small antral follicles
  - Inhibits primordial follicle recruitment
  - Decreases FSH sensitivity
  - Serum AMH correlates with ovarian reserve

**Antral Follicle Development (Gonadotropin-Dependent):**
- FSH binds FSHR (GPCR) on granulosa → cAMP/PKA → aromatase (CYP19A1) expression
- **Activin**: Enhances FSH receptor expression and action
- **Inhibin B**: Negative feedback on pituitary FSH secretion
- **Follistatin**: Binds and neutralizes activin

**Dominant Follicle Selection (Day 5-7):**
- One follicle achieves FSH sensitivity advantage (highest FSHR expression, most estradiol production)
- LH receptors appear on granulosa cells of dominant follicle
- IGF-1 amplifies FSH/LH action
- Non-dominant follicles undergo atresia as FSH declines

**LH Surge Mechanisms:**
- **Kisspeptin neurons** in AVPV (anteroventral periventricular nucleus) activated by high estrogen
- Kisspeptin stimulates GnRH surge
- Progesterone receptor (PR) activation required for surge (estrogen induces PR)
- LH surge activates:
  - EGFR signaling cascade
  - Prostaglandin synthesis (COX-2, PGE2)
  - Proteolytic cascades (ADAMTS, MMPs)
  - Cumulus expansion (hyaluronan synthase 2)
  - Meiotic resumption (decreased cAMP)

**Corpus Luteum Function:**
- Granulosa lutein cells (80%, secrete progesterone)
- Theca lutein cells (20%, secrete progesterone + androgens)
- LH maintains function via cAMP/PKA
- **Steroidogenesis**: StAR protein → cholesterol transport → P450scc → pregnenolone → 3β-HSD → progesterone
- **Luteolysis** (if no pregnancy): PGF2α, immune cell infiltration, apoptosis, regression to corpus albicans
- **Rescue** (if pregnancy): hCG (similar to LH) maintains corpus luteum until placenta assumes progesterone production (~10 weeks)

**Oocyte Maturation:**
- Primary oocyte arrested in **prophase I of meiosis I** (from fetal life)
- LH surge → decreased cAMP → MPF (maturation-promoting factor) activation
- **Germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD)**, spindle formation
- Completion of meiosis I → secondary oocyte + first polar body
- Arrest in **metaphase II of meiosis II**
- Fertilization triggers meiosis II completion → mature ovum + second polar body

**Endometrial Molecular Events:**

**Proliferative Phase:**
- **ER-α** (estrogen receptor alpha) mediates estrogen effects
- Cell proliferation: Ki-67 expression high
- Angiogenesis: VEGF upregulation, spiral arteriole growth
- Gland regeneration from basal layer

**Secretory Phase:**
- **Progesterone receptor (PR-A, PR-B)** isoforms
- **Early secretory** (days 15-19): Subnuclear vacuoles in glandular epithelium (glycogen)
- **Mid-secretory** (days 20-24): **Window of implantation**
  - Pinopodes on luminal epithelium (uterodomes)
  - Integrins (α4β1, αvβ3) expression
  - **LIF** (leukemia inhibitory factor), **HOXA10**, **IL-1** system
- **Late secretory** (days 25-28): Stromal decidualization, predecidual cells

**Implantation Cascade:**
1. **Apposition**: Blastocyst contacts endometrium (day 6-7 post-fertilization)
2. **Adhesion**: L-selectins, integrins, trophinin
3. **Invasion**: Trophoblast penetrates epithelium, invades stroma
   - Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
   - Controlled by decidual response

**Menstruation Molecular Mechanisms:**
- Progesterone withdrawal → PR loss, ER-α re-expression
- Inflammatory cascade: IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α
- **Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)**: MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9 degrade ECM
- Vasoconstriction: Endothelin, prostaglandin F2α
- Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) response
- Apoptosis and necrosis of functional layer
- Simultaneous repair initiated (estrogen, VEGF)

**Breast Development and Lactation:**
- **Puberty**: Estrogen → ductal growth; progesterone → alveolar development
- **Pregnancy**: Estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, hPL → lobulo-alveolar growth
- **Lactogenesis**:
  - Stage I (pregnancy): Alveolar differentiation
  - Stage II (postpartum): Copious milk secretion, triggered by progesterone withdrawal + prolactin
  - Stage III (established lactation): Supply-demand regulation
- **Milk synthesis**: Prolactin stimulates casein, lactalbumin production
- **Milk ejection**: Oxytocin causes myoepithelial cell contraction
- **Involution**: Apoptosis, tissue remodeling after weaning

- **MRI**: Detailed evaluation of adenomyosis, deep infiltrating endometriosis, complex masses

**Diagnostic Procedures:**
- **Hysteroscopy**: Direct visualization, biopsy, operative intervention (polyp/fibroid removal, septum resection, adhesiolysis)
- **Laparoscopy**: Gold standard for endometriosis diagnosis and treatment, tubal surgery, ovarian drilling (PCOS)

**Therapeutic Interventions:**

**Ovulation Induction:**
- **PCOS/Anovulation**:
  - First-line: **Letrozole** 2.5-7.5 mg days 3-7 (aromatase inhibitor, less multiple gestation than clomiphene)
  - Second-line: **Clomiphene citrate** 50-150 mg days 3-7 (SERM)
  - Third-line: **Gonadotropins** (FSH ± LH) with ultrasound monitoring (risk: OHSS, multiples)
  - Adjuncts: Metformin (insulin sensitizer), ovarian drilling (laparoscopic)
- **Hypothalamic amenorrhea**: Pulsatile GnRH or gonadotropins

**Controlled Ovarian Stimulation for IVF:**
- **Protocols**:
  - Antagonist protocol: Gonadotropins + GnRH antagonist (when LH rises), trigger with hCG or GnRH agonist
  - Long agonist protocol: GnRH agonist downregulation, then gonadotropins
  - Minimal stimulation: Low-dose gonadotropins or clomiphene
- **Monitoring**: Serial transvaginal ultrasound (follicle size), estradiol levels
- **Trigger**: hCG (standard) or GnRH agonist (lower OHSS risk, requires luteal progesterone)
- **Oocyte retrieval**: Transvaginal ultrasound-guided aspiration ~36 hours post-trigger
- **Luteal support**: Progesterone (vaginal, IM, oral) ± estradiol

**Embryo Culture and Transfer:**
- Fertilization: Conventional IVF or ICSI (male factor, prior fertilization failure)
- Culture to day 3 (6-8 cell) or day 5 (blastocyst)
- **Preimplantation genetic testing**:
  - PGT-A (aneuploidy screening): Improves implantation rates, reduces miscarriage
  - PGT-M (monogenic disorders): e.g., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell
  - PGT-SR (structural rearrangements): Translocations
- Embryo transfer: Fresh or frozen (freeze-all if OHSS risk, thin endometrium, PGT)
- Single embryo transfer preferred (reduce multiples)

**Surgical Management:**

**Tubal Factor:**
- **Hydrosalpinx**: Salpingectomy or proximal tubal occlusion before IVF (improves outcomes)
- **Tubal anastomosis**: Reversal of tubal ligation (microsurgical)
- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Salpingostomy (preserve tube) vs salpingectomy; medical management with methotrexate if eligible

**Uterine Factor:**
- **Fibroids**: Myomectomy (submucous, large intramural distorting cavity)
- **Polyps**: Hysteroscopic polypectomy
- **Septate uterus**: Hysteroscopic septum resection
- **Asherman syndrome**: Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis

**Endometriosis:**
- Laparoscopic excision/ablation of lesions, adhesiolysis
- **Endometriomas**: Cystectomy (may reduce ovarian reserve) vs drainage/ablation vs IVF without surgery
- Deep infiltrating endometriosis: Complex surgery (bowel, ureter involvement)

**Gynecologic Oncology:**

**Cervical Cancer Screening:**
- Cytology (Pap smear) ± HPV co-testing
- Guidelines: Start age 21, intervals vary by age/test modality
- Colposcopy for abnormal results
- LEEP, cone biopsy for high-grade lesions
- HPV vaccination (Gardasil 9): Prevents 90% of cervical cancers

**Ovarian Cancer:**
- Most common: High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC)
- Risk factors: BRCA1/2 mutations (40% BRCA1, 15% BRCA2 lifetime risk), family history, nulliparity, endometriosis (clear cell, endometrioid types)
- Screening: None effective for general population; BRCA carriers: TVUS + CA-125 every 6 months (limited sensitivity)
- **Diagnosis**: Pelvic mass (IOTA ultrasound criteria, ROMA algorithm), CA-125 elevated, imaging (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis)
- **Staging**: Surgical (FIGO), debulking (goal: no residual disease)
- **Treatment**: Cytoreductive surgery + platinum-based chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel)
- **Maintenance**: PARP inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, rucaparib) for BRCA/HRD tumors, bevacizumab (anti-VEGF)
- **Risk-reducing surgery**: Salpingo-oophorectomy for BRCA carriers (by age 35-40 BRCA1, 40-45 BRCA2)

**Endometrial Cancer:**
- Most common gynecologic malignancy in US
- Risk factors: Unopposed estrogen (obesity, PCOS, HRT), Lynch syndrome
- **Presentation**: Postmenopausal bleeding
- **Diagnosis**: Endometrial biopsy, TVUS (endometrial thickness >4 mm postmenopausal)
- **Staging**: Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ± lymph node dissection; molecular classification (POLE, MSI-H, p53abn, NSMP)
- **Treatment**: Surgery, radiation, chemotherapy based on stage/molecular profile

**Breast Cancer:**
- Screening: Mammography (starting age 40-50), MRI for high-risk
- Diagnostic workup: Ultrasound, core needle biopsy
- Surgical: Lumpectomy + radiation vs mastectomy ± reconstruction
- Oncotype Dx, MammaPrint: Genomic assays guide chemotherapy decisions
- Hormonal therapy: Tamoxifen (premenopausal), aromatase inhibitors (postmenopausal) for ER+ tumors
- HER2-targeted therapy: Trastuzumab, pertuzumab for HER2+ tumors

**Fertility Preservation:**
- **Oocyte cryopreservation**: Vitrification, ~90% survival
- **Embryo cryopreservation**: Requires partner/donor sperm
- **Ovarian tissue cryopreservation**: For prepubertal or urgent cases, experimental
- **Gonadal shielding**: During radiation
- **GnRH agonist co-treatment**: During chemotherapy (limited evidence)

**Emerging Technologies:**
- **In vitro maturation (IVM)**: Immature oocytes matured in lab (PCOS, cancer patients)
- **Artificial gametes**: Stem cell-derived oocytes (experimental)
- **Mitochondrial replacement therapy**: Prevent mitochondrial disease transmission
- **Uterus transplantation**: For absolute uterine factor infertility

**Spanish Medical Terms:**
- Infertility evaluation = Evaluación de infertilidad
- Ovarian reserve = Reserva ovárica
- Embryo transfer = Transferencia embrionaria
- Endometriosis = Endometriosis
- Ovarian cancer = Cáncer de ovario`,

      clinicalNotes:
        'For diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), AMH <1.0 ng/mL and FSH >10-15 IU/L, IVF success rates are lower but pregnancy still possible; consider donor oocytes if multiple failed cycles. Letrozole is now first-line for PCOS ovulation induction (higher live birth rate, fewer multiples vs clomiphene; PPCOS II trial). For BRCA carriers, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy reduces ovarian cancer risk by >90% and breast cancer risk by 50%; timing balances cancer risk vs surgical menopause. Single embryo transfer is standard of care in good prognosis patients to reduce twin pregnancies and associated maternal/fetal morbidity.',
