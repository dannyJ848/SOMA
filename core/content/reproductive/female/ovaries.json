      "summary": "The ovaries are two small organs that make eggs and female hormones.",
      "explanation": "The ovaries are located in the lower belly on each side of the uterus (womb). They are about the size and shape of almonds. The ovaries have two important jobs: making eggs (also called ova) that can combine with sperm to make a baby, and producing hormones like estrogen and progesterone that control puberty, menstrual periods, and pregnancy.",

      "level": 2,
      "summary": "The ovaries are paired endocrine and exocrine organs that produce oocytes through ovulation and secrete estrogen, progesterone, and other hormones under hypothalamic-pituitary regulation.",
      "explanation": "Each ovary is an almond-shaped organ (3-4 cm long) suspended in the pelvic cavity by the mesovarium (part of the broad ligament), suspensory ligament (containing ovarian vessels), and ovarian ligament (to uterus). The ovary has an outer cortex containing follicles at various stages of development and an inner medulla with blood vessels and nerves. Before birth, females develop approximately 1-2 million primary oocytes; by puberty, about 400,000 remain. Each month during reproductive years, FSH stimulates follicle development, one dominant follicle matures, and LH surge triggers ovulation (release of secondary oocyte). The remaining follicle becomes the corpus luteum, producing progesterone to prepare for pregnancy.",

      "summary": "The ovaries contain follicles at various maturation stages from primordial through antral, with dominant follicle selection driven by FSH sensitivity, culminating in LH-triggered ovulation and corpus luteum formation for progesterone production.",
      "explanation": "Folliculogenesis: Primordial follicles (oocyte arrested in prophase I + single layer of flat granulosa cells) → Primary follicles (cuboidal granulosa, zona pellucida forms) → Secondary follicles (multiple granulosa layers, theca interna appears) → Antral (Graafian) follicles (fluid-filled antrum, theca externa). FSH promotes granulosa cell aromatase expression, converting theca-derived androgens to estradiol ('two-cell, two-gonadotropin' model). Rising estrogen triggers LH surge via positive feedback on hypothalamus. LH surge causes oocyte meiotic resumption (to metaphase II), follicular rupture, and luteinization. The corpus luteum secretes progesterone and some estrogen; if pregnancy occurs, hCG maintains it; otherwise, it degenerates into corpus albicans. Ovarian blood supply: ovarian artery (from aorta) and ovarian branch of uterine artery.",

      "summary": "Ovarian function integrates intraovarian paracrine signaling (AMH, inhibins, growth factors) with HPG axis endocrine control, governing follicle recruitment, dominant follicle selection, and the ovulatory cascade with implications for fertility and reproductive endocrine disorders.",
      "explanation": "Follicle dynamics: Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) from granulosa cells inhibits primordial follicle recruitment and reduces FSH sensitivity. Inhibin B (from small antral follicles, early follicular phase) and Inhibin A (from corpus luteum, luteal phase) selectively suppress FSH. Dominant follicle selection occurs when one follicle gains FSH sensitivity advantage; declining FSH causes atresia of other follicles (Graafian follicle continues via high estrogen/LH receptors). LH surge triggers: meiotic resumption (via decreased intra-oocyte cAMP), cumulus expansion, follicular rupture (via proteases, prostaglandins), and luteinization. Ovarian steroidogenesis uses cholesterol transported by StAR protein. The aging ovary shows accelerating follicle depletion, declining AMH and inhibin, rising FSH, and eventual menopause. Ovarian reserve assessment: AMH, day 3 FSH/estradiol, antral follicle count (AFC) by ultrasound.",
