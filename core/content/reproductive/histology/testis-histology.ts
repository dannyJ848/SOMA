      explanation: `## What Is Testis Histology?

Testis histology is the study of testicular tissue under a microscope. It shows how sperm are produced and how testosterone is made.

### Main Parts of the Testis

**1. Seminiferous Tubules (Sperm-Making Tubes)**
- Tiny, coiled tubes (over 800 per testis)
- Where sperm are produced
- Lined with developing sperm cells
- If stretched out, would be about 250 meters long

**2. Interstitial Tissue (Space Between Tubes)**
- Contains Leydig cells
- Makes testosterone (male hormone)
- Has blood vessels and supporting cells

**3. Sertoli Cells (Nurse Cells)**
- Support and nourish developing sperm
- Form the blood-testis barrier
- Control sperm development environment

### How Sperm Are Made

**The Process (Spermatogenesis):**
1. Stem cells at the basement membrane divide
2. Cells move up through layers as they mature
3. Primary spermatocytes form and divide
4. Secondary spermatocytes divide again
5. Spermatids transform into sperm
6. Sperm released into the center of the tube

**Time Required:**
- From start to finish: about 74 days
- Thousands of sperm made every second
- About 100-200 million sperm per day

### Key Cell Types

**Inside the Tubules:**
- Spermatogonia (stem cells)
- Spermatocytes (dividing cells)
- Spermatids (maturing cells)
- Spermatozoa (mature sperm)
- Sertoli cells (support cells)

**Outside the Tubules:**
- Leydig cells (make testosterone)
- Blood vessels
- Connective tissue
- Macrophages

### The Blood-Testis Barrier

- Protects developing sperm from immune system
- Formed by tight junctions between Sertoli cells
- Prevents harmful substances from reaching sperm
- Keeps sperm antigens separate from blood`,

### Germ Cell Development

**Spermatogonia (Stem Cells):**

Types:
- **Adark (Ad):** Reserve stem cells, rarely divide
- **Apale (Ap):** Proliferating stem cells
- **Type B:** Committed to differentiation

Location: On basement membrane
Kinetics: Mitotic divisions maintain stem cell pool

1. Y chromosome microdeletions are the second most common genetic cause of male infertility after Klinefelter syndrome. AZFc deletions have the best prognosis for sperm retrieval with TESE.

2. Testicular sperm extraction (micro-TESE) has revolutionized treatment for non-obstructive azoospermia, finding sperm in 40-60% of men with NOA.

3. Spermatogenesis is highly sensitive to chemotherapy. Alkylating agents are most toxic. Cryopreservation of sperm should be offered before cancer treatment.

4. The blood-testis barrier creates an immunologically privileged site. Breach (trauma, biopsy, vasectomy reversal) can trigger autoimmune orchitis.

5. Spermatogonial stem cell transplantation remains experimental but holds promise for fertility preservation in prepubertal boys undergoing sterilizing cancer treatment.`,
