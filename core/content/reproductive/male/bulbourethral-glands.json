      "summary": "The bulbourethral glands are two tiny glands that make a slippery fluid to help during sexual activity.",
      "explanation": "These pea-sized glands are located below the prostate. They produce a clear, slippery fluid called pre-ejaculate or 'pre-cum' that comes out before ejaculation. This fluid has two important jobs: it lubricates the urethra to make it easier for sperm to travel through, and it neutralizes any leftover acidic urine that could harm sperm.",

      "summary": "The bulbourethral glands (Cowper's glands) are paired accessory glands that secrete alkaline mucus to lubricate the urethra and neutralize residual urinary acidity before ejaculation.",
      "explanation": "Each bulbourethral gland is about 1 cm in diameter, located within the urogenital diaphragm (deep perineal pouch) on either side of the membranous urethra. Their ducts are approximately 2.5 cm long and empty into the bulbar (proximal spongy) urethra. The glands secrete a clear, viscous, mucoid fluid during sexual arousal that precedes ejaculation. This pre-ejaculatory fluid serves to: lubricate the urethral lumen, neutralize acidic urinary residue, and provide additional lubrication for intercourse. The volume secreted is typically 0.5-5 mL.",

      "summary": "The bulbourethral glands are compound tubuloalveolar glands producing a mucinous, alkaline secretion rich in galactose and sialic acid, released during the excitement phase of the sexual response to prepare the urethra for ejaculation.",
      "explanation": "Histologically, the glands consist of mucus-secreting tubuloalveolar acini surrounded by fibrous capsule and skeletal muscle fibers of the urogenital diaphragm. The secretory cells are columnar with basal nuclei and apical mucin granules, resembling pyloric glands of the stomach. The secretion contains galactose, galactosamine, sialic acid, and mucins that provide lubricating properties. Parasympathetic stimulation (from pelvic splanchnic nerves, S2-S4) triggers secretion during sexual arousal. The ducts penetrate the perineal membrane to enter the bulbar urethra. Blood supply is from branches of the internal pudendal artery.",

      "level": 4,
      "summary": "The bulbourethral glands demonstrate parasympathetic-regulated mucin secretion with biochemical composition optimized for urethral conditioning, though their contribution to overall seminal volume and fertility is minimal compared to other accessory glands.",
      "explanation": "The glands' secretory function involves muscarinic receptor activation (M3 subtype) leading to intracellular calcium release and mucin exocytosis. The glycoprotein-rich secretion (MUC5B, MUC5AC type mucins) creates a protective film over urethral epithelium. While the pre-ejaculatory fluid itself does not contain sperm, it may pick up residual sperm from the urethra, explaining pregnancy risk with withdrawal method. The glands are androgen-sensitive, with testosterone maintaining epithelial secretory function. Clinical significance is limited but includes: syringocele (cystic dilation of duct), cowperitis (infection, rare), and potential site of urethral stricture. In forensic context, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is detectable in bulbourethral secretion, relevant for sexual assault examination.",

      "summary": "The bulbourethral glands, while minor contributors to seminal volume, have clinical relevance in urethral pathology, forensic medicine, and contraceptive counseling regarding pre-ejaculatory fluid sperm content.",
      "explanation": "Clinical contexts: 1) Contraceptive counseling: studies show viable sperm in pre-ejaculatory fluid in variable proportions (0-40%) of samples, primarily reflecting contamination from prior ejaculation rather than glandular origin; counseling about withdrawal failure rates (20% typical use) should address this; 2) Urethral pathology: syringocele classification (simple/perforated/ruptured) guides management; bulbourethral gland abscess rare but reported; Cowper's duct cyst can mimic urethral diverticulum; 3) Forensic: PSA detection in pre-ejaculatory fluid informs sexual assault forensic protocols; 4) Comparative anatomy: glands are more prominent in some species (boar bulbourethral gland secretion forms gel plug). Imaging: MRI can visualize bulbourethral glands and their ducts; voiding cystourethrography may show syringocele. Surgical considerations: glands lie within urogenital diaphragm, relevant for perineal approaches.",

Syringocele should be in differential for young males with unexplained voiding symptoms; MRI and cystourethroscopy are diagnostic modalities."
