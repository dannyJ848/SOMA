      explanation: `## What Is Erectile Dysfunction?

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the inability to get or keep an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse.

### Very Common Condition

- Affects about 30 million men in the US
- About 40% of men at age 40
- About 70% of men at age 70
- More common with age but not inevitable
- Treatable at any age

### How Erections Work

1. Sexual stimulation sends signals to nerves
2. Nerves release chemicals that increase blood flow
3. Blood fills two chambers in the penis (corpora cavernosa)
4. Penis becomes firm and enlarged
5. After orgasm, blood flows out

### Common Causes

**Physical:**
- Heart disease
- Diabetes
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Obesity
- Low testosterone
- Medications

**Psychological:**
- Stress
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Relationship problems

**Lifestyle:**
- Smoking
- Alcohol use
- Drug use
- Lack of exercise

### When to See a Doctor

- ED persists for several weeks
- Happens more than half the time
- Causing distress or relationship problems
- May be first sign of heart disease

### Treatment Options

- Lifestyle changes (exercise, quit smoking)
- Oral medications (Viagra, Cialis)
- Hormone therapy if low testosterone
- Counseling
- Vacuum devices
- Penile injections
- Surgery (penile implants)

### Important Note

ED can be an early warning sign of cardiovascular disease. Men with ED should have heart health checked.`,

3. Penile rehabilitation after radical prostatectomy with early and regular PDE5 inhibitor use improves recovery of erectile function.

4. Testosterone replacement only helps ED in men with documented hypogonadism. It should not be used as first-line ED treatment.
