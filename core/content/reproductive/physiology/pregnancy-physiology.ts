      summary: 'Pregnancy causes many changes in the mother\'s body to support the growing baby, including increased blood volume, changes in breathing, and shifts in how the body uses food for energy.',
      explanation: `## How Pregnancy Changes the Body

During pregnancy, a woman\'s body goes through remarkable changes to support the growing baby. These changes help provide oxygen and nutrients while removing waste.

### Heart and Blood Changes

**More Blood:**
- The body makes 30-50% more blood
- This extra blood brings nutrients to the baby
- The heart pumps faster and harder

**Blood Pressure:**
- Blood pressure usually drops slightly in early pregnancy
- This is normal and helps blood flow to the placenta

### Breathing Changes

**Deeper Breaths:**
- Pregnant women breathe more deeply
- The body needs more oxygen for the baby
- The growing belly pushes the diaphragm up

### Digestive Changes

**Slower Digestion:**
- Food moves more slowly through the stomach and intestines
- This helps absorb more nutrients for the baby
- Can cause heartburn and constipation

### Kidney Changes

**More Urine:**
- The kidneys work harder to filter waste from both mother and baby
- Blood flow to kidneys increases
- Need to urinate more frequently

### Metabolism Changes

**Energy Needs:**
- The body uses more energy (calories)
- In early pregnancy, the body stores nutrients
- In later pregnancy, nutrients go directly to the baby

### Weight Gain

Healthy weight gain during pregnancy:
- Total gain: 25-35 pounds for normal-weight women
- Baby: about 7-8 pounds
- Placenta: about 1-2 pounds
- Amniotic fluid: about 2 pounds
- Increased blood: about 4 pounds
- Breast growth: about 1-2 pounds
- Stored fat and protein: about 5-9 pounds`,

      summary: 'Pregnancy physiology involves complex endocrine, cardiovascular, and metabolic adaptations orchestrated by placental hormones. The placenta produces steroid and peptide hormones that remodel maternal physiology to support fetal growth while maintaining maternal homeostasis.',
      explanation: `## Hormonal Regulation of Pregnancy

### Placental Hormones

**Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG):**

      clinicalNotes: `Clinical Implementation Pearls:

1. **Preeclampsia Risk Stratification:**
   - First trimester screening combining maternal factors, MAP, uterine artery Doppler, and PAPP-A/PlGF
   - sFlt-1/PlGF ratio useful for differential diagnosis and prognosis
   - Low PlGF (<100 pg/mL) rules out preeclampsia with high negative predictive value

2. **Pharmacologic Adjustments:**
   - Most drugs require increased dosing in pregnancy due to increased volume and clearance
   - Lithium, phenytoin, and other narrow therapeutic index drugs need frequent monitoring
   - Enoxaparin often requires weight-based dosing or anti-Xa monitoring

3. **Long-term Follow-up:**
   - Women with preeclampsia, GDM, or preterm delivery need cardiovascular risk factor screening
   - Breastfeeding may attenuate some metabolic risks
   - Lifestyle intervention postpartum is crucial window`,
