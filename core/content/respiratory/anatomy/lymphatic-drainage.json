      "summary": "Your lungs have a network of tiny tubes called lymphatics that collect fluid and germs, moving them to small filters called lymph nodes that help fight infection.",
      "explanation": "Besides blood vessels, your lungs have another network of tubes called lymphatics. These are like the drainage system for your lungs. They collect extra fluid, dead cells, and any germs that get into your lungs. This fluid (called lymph) flows through these tubes to small bean-shaped filters called lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, white blood cells check the fluid for germs and destroy any they find. The lung lymph nodes are located around your airways and in the center of your chest. This system helps keep your lungs clean and fights infections.",

      "summary": "Pulmonary lymphatics form superficial and deep networks draining through hilar, mediastinal, and eventually systemic lymph nodes, playing crucial roles in fluid balance and immune surveillance.",
      "explanation": "The lungs have two lymphatic networks: the superficial (subpleural) network in the visceral pleura, and the deep (peribronchial/perivascular) network around the airways and blood vessels. These networks connect at the hilum and drain to bronchopulmonary (hilar) nodes, then to tracheobronchial nodes (at the carina), and finally to mediastinal nodes. From there, lymph flows to the right lymphatic duct (right lung and left lower lobe) or thoracic duct (left upper lobe). Lymphatics are absent from alveolar walls - they begin at the level of respiratory bronchioles. The lymphatic system maintains fluid balance by removing about 10-20mL/hour of filtered fluid and proteins from the interstitium, and it's crucial for antigen transport to lymph nodes for immune responses.",

      "summary": "Pulmonary lymphatic anatomy follows a standardized station map critical for lung cancer staging, with understanding of drainage patterns essential for surgical and oncological management.",
      "explanation": "The IASLC lymph node map defines specific stations: Station 1 (highest mediastinal), 2 (upper paratracheal), 3a (prevascular), 3p (retrotracheal), 4 (lower paratracheal), 5 (subaortic/AP window), 6 (para-aortic), 7 (subcarinal), 8 (paraesophageal), 9 (pulmonary ligament), 10 (hilar), 11 (interlobar), 12 (lobar), 13 (segmental), 14 (subsegmental). N1 disease involves stations 10-14 (intrapulmonary); N2 involves stations 2-9 (ipsilateral mediastinal); N3 involves contralateral or supraclavicular nodes. Lymphatic drainage follows lobe-specific patterns: right upper lobe drains primarily to stations 2R, 4R; middle lobe to 4R, 7; right lower lobe to 7, 8, 9; left upper lobe to 5, 6; left lower lobe to 7, 8, 9. Cross-drainage occurs, especially at the subcarinal (station 7) nodes.",

      "summary": "Pulmonary lymphatic physiology integrates interstitial fluid dynamics, lymphangiogenesis in disease, and the role of lymphatics in pulmonary edema, tumor metastasis, and inflammatory conditions.",
      "explanation": "Pulmonary lymphatic flow increases with transvascular fluid filtration; they provide a safety factor against edema development, capable of increasing flow 10-fold before edema develops. Lymphatic endothelial cells express specific markers (LYVE-1, podoplanin, Prox1, VEGFR-3) and respond to VEGF-C/D for lymphangiogenesis. In interstitial lung diseases, lymphatic abnormalities may contribute to fluid accumulation and fibrosis. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) involves abnormal smooth muscle proliferation obstructing lymphatics. In lung cancer, lymphatic invasion (LVI) is a key prognostic factor; tumor cells express factors (VEGF-C) promoting lymphangiogenesis at the tumor margin. Sentinel lymph node mapping has been explored in lung cancer but is not standard practice due to variable drainage patterns. PD-L1 expression in lymph node metastases may differ from primary tumor, impacting immunotherapy decisions.",

      "summary": "Advanced lymphatic assessment integrates molecular staging, minimally invasive techniques, and targeted therapies with evolving understanding of the lymphatic tumor microenvironment.",
      "explanation": "Contemporary nodal staging in lung cancer utilizes multimodality approach: PET-CT for initial assessment (sensitivity 80%, specificity 90% for N2 disease), followed by tissue confirmation via EBUS-TBNA (stations 2, 3p, 4, 7, 10, 11) and/or EUS-FNA (stations 4L, 7, 8, 9). Mediastinoscopy remains gold standard for anterior mediastinum (stations 2, 4, 7). Molecular profiling of lymph node metastases guides therapy selection. Systematic nodal dissection at surgery improves staging accuracy; ACOSOG Z0030 showed no survival benefit of complete dissection over sampling, though practice varies. Lymphatic delivery of therapeutics (inhaled immunotherapy, lymphatic-targeted nanoparticles) is being explored. For chylothorax, thoracic duct ligation or embolization is effective; lymphovenous anastomosis emerging for lymphedema. Lymph node ratio and log odds of positive lymph nodes may better predict prognosis than simple N staging in some analyses.",
