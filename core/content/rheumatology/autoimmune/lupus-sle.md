# Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)

## Overview
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or "lupus") is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect almost any organ system. The immune system produces antibodies against the body's own tissues, causing inflammation and damage. Lupus is characterized by periods of flares and remissions, and its presentation varies greatly between individuals.

## What Is Lupus?

### Level 1: Foundation
Lupus is a condition where your immune system attacks healthy parts of your body. It can affect:
- Skin (rashes, especially on the face)
- Joints (pain and swelling)
- Kidneys
- Heart and lungs
- Brain
- Blood cells

Lupus is called "the great imitator" because it can look like many other diseases.

**Key Points:**
- More common in women (9:1 ratio)
- Often starts between ages 15-45
- Symptoms come and go in "flares"
- No cure, but treatment can control symptoms

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Types of Lupus:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) | Most common, affects multiple organs |
| Cutaneous lupus | Skin only (discoid, subacute) |
| Drug-induced lupus | Caused by certain medications, reversible |
| Neonatal lupus | Affects newborns of mothers with certain antibodies |

**Who Gets SLE?**
- Women: 9 times more common than men
- African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans: Higher rates and more severe
- Family history increases risk
- Environmental triggers: UV light, infections, certain medications

**Common Symptoms:**
- Fatigue (most common complaint)
- Joint pain without deformity
- Skin rashes, photosensitivity
- Fever
- Hair loss
- Mouth sores
- Raynaud's phenomenon (fingers turn white/blue in cold)

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Classic Presentation Patterns:**

**Skin:**
- **Malar (butterfly) rash**: Erythema over cheeks and nose bridge, spares nasolabial folds
- **Discoid rash**: Raised, scarring plaques on face, scalp, ears
- **Photosensitivity**: Rash after sun exposure
- **Oral ulcers**: Usually painless

**Musculoskeletal:**
- Non-erosive arthritis (unlike RA)
- Jaccoud's arthropathy: Reducible deformities
- Avascular necrosis (from disease or steroids)
- Myositis (less common)

**Renal (Lupus Nephritis):**
- Occurs in 40-60% of patients
- May be asymptomatic initially
- Proteinuria, hematuria, hypertension
- Can progress to kidney failure
- Classes I-VI based on biopsy

**Cardiopulmonary:**
- Pericarditis (most common cardiac)
- Pleuritis (chest pain with breathing)
- Libman-Sacks endocarditis (non-infectious)
- Interstitial lung disease
- Pulmonary hypertension

**Neuropsychiatric:**
- Cognitive dysfunction ("lupus fog")
- Headaches
- Seizures
- Psychosis
- Stroke (with antiphospholipid antibodies)

**Hematologic:**
- Anemia (hemolytic or chronic disease)
- Leukopenia
- Lymphopenia
- Thrombocytopenia

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Immunopathogenesis:**

1. **Genetic Susceptibility:**
   - HLA-DR2, HLA-DR3
   - Complement deficiencies (C1q, C2, C4)
   - Interferon regulatory genes

2. **Environmental Triggers:**
   - UV light damages DNA, triggers apoptosis
   - Infections (EBV association)
   - Hormones (estrogen promotes autoimmunity)
   - Medications (hydralazine, procainamide)

3. **Immune Dysregulation:**
   - Defective clearance of apoptotic cells
   - Nuclear antigens exposed to immune system
   - Loss of B-cell and T-cell tolerance
   - Autoantibody production

4. **Tissue Damage:**
   - Immune complex deposition
   - Complement activation
   - Direct antibody-mediated damage
   - Cytokine-driven inflammation

**Key Autoantibodies:**

| Antibody | Prevalence | Clinical Association |
|----------|------------|---------------------|
| ANA | 95-99% | Screening test, not specific |
| Anti-dsDNA | 60-70% | Lupus nephritis, disease activity |
| Anti-Smith | 25-30% | Highly specific for SLE |
| Anti-Ro (SSA) | 30-40% | Neonatal lupus, photosensitivity |
| Anti-La (SSB) | 15-20% | Often with anti-Ro |
| Anti-RNP | 25-30% | Mixed connective tissue disease |
| Antiphospholipid | 30-40% | Clotting, pregnancy loss |
| Anti-ribosomal P | 10-20% | Neuropsychiatric lupus |

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Type I Interferon Pathway:**
- Central to SLE pathogenesis
- Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce IFN-alpha
- "Interferon signature" in blood
- Therapeutic target (anifrolumab)

**Complement System:**
- C3, C4 low during active disease
- Classical pathway activation by immune complexes
- Complement deficiency predisposes to SLE
- Monitor levels for disease activity

**B-Cell Abnormalities:**
- Hyperactive B cells
- Increased survival signals (BAFF/BLyS)
- Therapeutic target (belimumab)

| Steroids | Blood sugar, bone density, blood pressure |
| Azathioprine | CBC, liver function |
| Mycophenolate | CBC, pregnancy test (teratogenic) |
| Methotrexate | CBC, liver function, chest X-ray |

**Comorbidity Management:**

| Risk | Management |
|------|------------|

- Support groups
- Workplace accommodations

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS):**
- Present in 30-40% of lupus patients
- Increases clotting risk
- Can cause pregnancy loss
- May need anticoagulation
- Monitor if antibodies positive

**Neonatal Lupus Prevention:**
- Anti-Ro positive mothers
- Risk: Rash, heart block in baby
- Hydroxychloroquine reduces risk

## Drug-Induced Lupus

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Medications Most Associated:**
- Hydralazine
- Procainamide
- Isoniazid
- TNF inhibitors
- Minocycline

**Characteristics:**
- Develops after months of drug exposure
- Usually milder than SLE
- Anti-histone antibodies often positive
- Resolves with drug discontinuation
- Kidney and CNS involvement rare

---

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **ANA is sensitive** but not specific - positive ANA does not equal lupus
2. **Hydroxychloroquine** reduces flares, damage, and mortality - all patients should take it
3. **Anti-dsDNA and complement** levels help monitor disease activity
4. **Lupus nephritis** may be silent - check urinalysis regularly
5. **Cardiovascular disease** is a leading cause of death - treat risk factors aggressively
6. **Pregnancy** requires careful planning and monitoring
7. **Sun protection** is essential - UV light triggers flares
8. **CRP is usually normal** in lupus flares - if elevated, think infection

---

## Summary

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a complex autoimmune disease affecting multiple organ systems, most commonly skin, joints, and kidneys. Diagnosis requires clinical features and supportive lab findings, particularly ANA and specific autoantibodies. Hydroxychloroquine is the cornerstone of therapy for all patients. Treatment intensity depends on organ involvement, with immunosuppression required for major organ disease. Regular monitoring, sun protection, cardiovascular risk management, and careful pregnancy planning are essential aspects of long-term care. With modern treatment, most patients with lupus can lead full, active lives.
