# Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

## Overview
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that primarily attacks the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and eventual joint damage. Unlike osteoarthritis (wear-and-tear arthritis), RA occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues. It typically affects joints symmetrically and can also impact other organs.

## What Is Rheumatoid Arthritis?

### Level 1: Foundation
Rheumatoid arthritis is a condition where your immune system attacks your joints by mistake. This causes:
- Joint pain and swelling
- Morning stiffness lasting more than 30 minutes
- Fatigue
- The same joints affected on both sides of the body

Think of it as your body's defense system getting confused and attacking healthy joint tissue instead of germs.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
RA is a systemic autoimmune disease, meaning it affects the whole body, not just joints.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Symmetric involvement**: If one knee is affected, the other usually is too
- **Small joints first**: Often starts in hands (knuckles, wrists) and feet
- **Morning stiffness**: Lasting 30+ minutes, improves with movement
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, low-grade fever, weight loss
- **Progressive**: Without treatment, causes permanent joint damage

**Who Gets RA?**
- Affects 0.5-1% of the population
- Women 2-3 times more likely than men
- Peak onset: Ages 30-60
- Can occur at any age (juvenile RA in children)

**Risk Factors:**
- Family history of RA or autoimmune diseases
- Smoking (major modifiable risk factor)
- Obesity
- History of certain infections
- Female sex hormones (may explain higher rates in women)

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Joints Most Commonly Affected:**

| Joint | Frequency | Specific Features |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) | Very common | Knuckle swelling |
| Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) | Very common | Middle finger joints |
| Wrist | Very common | Carpal tunnel possible |
| Metatarsophalangeal (MTP) | Common | Toe pain, especially morning |
| Knee | Common | Large effusions |
| Cervical spine | Common | C1-C2 instability risk |
| Shoulder | Moderate | Rotator cuff involvement |
| Hip | Less common | Late involvement |

**Joints Typically Spared:**
- Distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints - suggests OA instead
- Lower lumbar spine
- Sacroiliac joints (suggests ankylosing spondylitis)

**Extra-Articular Manifestations:**

| System | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Skin | Rheumatoid nodules (elbows, fingers) |
| Lungs | Interstitial lung disease, nodules, pleuritis |
| Heart | Pericarditis, increased cardiovascular risk |
| Eyes | Scleritis, episcleritis, dry eyes |
| Blood | Anemia of chronic disease |
| Nervous | Carpal tunnel, cervical myelopathy |
| Vascular | Vasculitis (severe RA) |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Immunopathogenesis:**

1. **Initiation Phase:**
   - Genetic susceptibility (HLA-DR4, HLA-DR1)
   - Environmental trigger (smoking, infection, gut microbiome)
   - Citrullination of proteins creates neoantigens
   - Loss of tolerance to citrullinated proteins

2. **Inflammation Phase:**
   - Autoantibodies form (RF, anti-CCP)
   - T cells and B cells infiltrate synovium
   - Macrophages release TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6
   - Synovial hyperplasia (pannus formation)

3. **Destruction Phase:**
   - Pannus invades cartilage and bone
   - Osteoclast activation causes bone erosions
   - Matrix metalloproteinases destroy cartilage
   - Joint space narrowing and deformity

**Key Cytokines:**
- **TNF-alpha**: Major driver of inflammation
- **IL-6**: Systemic symptoms, acute phase response
- **IL-1**: Cartilage destruction
- **IL-17**: Bone erosion

**Autoantibodies:**
- **Rheumatoid Factor (RF)**: IgM against IgG Fc; 70-80% positive
- **Anti-CCP (ACPA)**: More specific (95%); predicts erosive disease
- **Seronegative RA**: RF and anti-CCP negative; can be equally severe

### Level 5: Expert Integration
**Genetic Architecture:**
- HLA-DRB1 shared epitope: Strongest genetic risk
- PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1-C5 genes
- Heritability estimated at 50-60%
- Gene-environment interactions (smoking + HLA-DRB1)

**Pre-RA State:**
- Anti-CCP antibodies can appear years before symptoms
- "At-risk" individuals: Family history + positive antibodies
- Mucosal origin hypothesis: Lung, gut as initiation sites
- Periodontal disease (P. gingivalis) may trigger citrullination

**Synovial Pathology:**
- Lining layer hyperplasia (normally 1-2 cells, becomes 8-10)
- Lymphoid neogenesis: Ectopic germinal centers
- Angiogenesis: New blood vessel formation
- Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS): Aggressive, invasive behavior

## Diagnosis

### Level 1: Foundation
Doctors diagnose RA using:
- Your symptoms and physical exam
- Blood tests looking for inflammation and specific antibodies
- X-rays or other imaging to check for joint damage

There's no single test for RA - doctors put together several pieces of evidence.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**2010 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria:**
Score of 6 or more needed (maximum 10):

| Category | Criteria | Score |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Joint involvement | 1 large joint | 0 |
| | 2-10 large joints | 1 |
| | 1-3 small joints | 2 |
| | 4-10 small joints | 3 |
| | >10 joints (at least 1 small) | 5 |
| Serology | Negative RF and anti-CCP | 0 |
| | Low positive RF or anti-CCP | 2 |
| | High positive RF or anti-CCP | 3 |
| Acute phase reactants | Normal CRP and ESR | 0 |
| | Abnormal CRP or ESR | 1 |
| Duration | <6 weeks | 0 |
| | ≥6 weeks | 1 |

**Key Blood Tests:**
- **RF (Rheumatoid Factor)**: Positive in 70-80%; not specific
- **Anti-CCP (ACPA)**: Positive in 70-80%; very specific (95%)
- **ESR and CRP**: Measure inflammation levels
- **CBC**: May show anemia

| X-ray | Erosions, joint space narrowing | Baseline, monitoring |
| Ultrasound | Synovitis, erosions, power Doppler for inflammation | Early diagnosis, guiding injections |
| MRI | Early erosions, bone marrow edema, synovitis | Diagnostic uncertainty, cervical spine |

**X-ray Findings (Late):**
- Periarticular osteopenia
- Joint space narrowing
- Marginal erosions
- Subluxation and deformity

**Ultrasound Advantages:**
- Detects synovitis earlier than clinical exam
- Power Doppler shows active inflammation
- No radiation
- Can be done in office

**Differential Diagnosis:**

| Condition | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Osteoarthritis | DIP involvement, no morning stiffness, bony enlargement |
| Psoriatic arthritis | DIP involvement, psoriasis, dactylitis, asymmetric |
| Lupus (SLE) | Non-erosive, rash, renal involvement |
| Gout | Acute attacks, uric acid crystals, asymmetric |
| Viral arthritis | Self-limited, recent infection |

### Level 4: Advanced Mechanisms
**Prognostic Factors for Aggressive Disease:**
- High-titer anti-CCP antibodies
- Multiple joint involvement at onset
- Early erosions on imaging
- High disease activity scores
- Smoking
- Low socioeconomic status
- Shared epitope positive

**Disease Activity Measures:**

| Score | Components | Target |
|-------|------------|--------|
| DAS28 | 28 joint count, ESR/CRP, patient global | <2.6 (remission) |
| CDAI | 28 joint count, evaluator/patient global | ≤2.8 (remission) |
| SDAI | CDAI + CRP | ≤3.3 (remission) |
| Boolean | TJC, SJC, CRP, patient global all ≤1 | All criteria met |

## Treatment

### Level 1: Foundation
RA treatment aims to:
- Reduce pain and swelling
- Prevent joint damage
- Maintain function and quality of life

**Treatment includes:**
- Medications that calm the immune system
- Pain relief medications
- Physical therapy and exercise
- Sometimes surgery for damaged joints

Early treatment is crucial - the sooner you start, the better the outcomes.

### Level 2: Core Understanding
**Treat-to-Target Strategy:**
Modern RA management aims for remission or low disease activity.

**Medication Categories:**

**1. NSAIDs (Pain/Inflammation Relief):**
- Ibuprofen, naproxen, celecoxib
- Control symptoms but don't prevent damage
- Use lowest effective dose for shortest time

**2. Glucocorticoids (Steroids):**
- Prednisone, methylprednisolone
- Fast-acting, bridge therapy while DMARDs take effect
- Goal: Minimize long-term use due to side effects

**3. Conventional DMARDs:**
- Methotrexate: First-line, gold standard
- Sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine
- Take 6-12 weeks to work
- Disease-modifying: Slow or prevent joint damage

**4. Biologic DMARDs:**
- Target specific immune pathways
- Used when conventional DMARDs fail
- TNF inhibitors, IL-6 inhibitors, etc.

**5. Targeted Synthetic DMARDs:**
- JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib)
- Oral medications
- Similar efficacy to biologics

### Level 3: Clinical Application
**Treatment Algorithm:**

```
Diagnosis confirmed
        ↓
Start methotrexate (unless contraindicated)
+ Consider short-term prednisone bridge
        ↓
Reassess at 3 months
        ↓
    Inadequate response?
        ↓
Add or switch to biologic or JAK inhibitor
        ↓
Reassess at 3-6 months
        ↓
Continue if target achieved; switch if not
```

**Methotrexate Details:**
- Starting dose: 10-15 mg weekly (oral or subcutaneous)
- Maximum: 25 mg weekly

## Key Clinical Pearls

1. **Early treatment** prevents joint damage - "window of opportunity" in first 3-6 months
2. **Methotrexate** is first-line for most patients; always give with folic acid
3. **Anti-CCP positive** patients have more aggressive, erosive disease
4. **Treat-to-target**: Aim for remission or low disease activity
5. **Cardiovascular risk** is elevated - treat it aggressively
6. **Smoking cessation** improves disease outcomes and treatment response
7. **Vaccinate before** starting immunosuppression when possible

---

## Summary

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease causing symmetric inflammatory arthritis that, without treatment, leads to joint destruction and disability. Modern treatment with the "treat-to-target" strategy using methotrexate and biologic/targeted DMARDs can achieve remission in many patients. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are essential to prevent irreversible damage. Living well with RA requires medication adherence, joint protection, appropriate exercise, and managing comorbidities including cardiovascular risk.
