# Breast Cancer Screening

## Overview

### Level 1: Basic Understanding

**What is breast cancer screening?**
Tests to find breast cancer early, before you notice any lumps or changes.

**Main screening test: Mammogram**
- An X-ray picture of your breasts
- Can find cancer too small to feel
- Takes about 20 minutes

**Who should be screened?**
- Women ages 50-74: Recommended every 2 years
- Women ages 40-49: Talk with your doctor about when to start
- Men: Usually only if high risk

**Why it matters:**
Finding breast cancer early means better treatment options and better outcomes.

### Level 2: Expanded Information

**Types of Breast Cancer Screening**

**1. Mammography** (main screening method)
- Uses low-dose X-rays
- Creates images of breast tissue
- Can detect cancers 1-3 years before they're large enough to feel

Two types:
- **2D mammography**: Traditional single X-ray images
- **3D mammography (tomosynthesis)**: Multiple images from different angles, may find more cancers and reduce false positives

**2. Clinical Breast Exam**
- Healthcare provider feels your breasts for lumps
- Mixed evidence on effectiveness
- Often done during regular checkups

**3. Breast Self-Exam**
- Checking your own breasts for changes
- No longer routinely recommended
- But knowing what's normal for you is valuable

**Current Recommendations (Average Risk Women)**

| Organization | When to Start | How Often | When to Stop |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| USPSTF | Age 50 (40-49 individual decision) | Every 2 years | Age 74 |
| American Cancer Society | Age 45 (40-44 option) | Yearly 45-54, then every 2 years | When life expectancy <10 years |
| ACR/SBI | Age 40 | Yearly | When life expectancy <5-7 years |

**Note**: Guidelines differ. Discuss with your doctor what's right for you.

### Level 3: Intermediate Detail

**Understanding Mammogram Results**

**BI-RADS Categories** (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System):

| Category | Meaning | Next Steps |
|----------|---------|------------|
| 0 | Need additional imaging | More tests needed |
| 1 | Negative | Normal screening |
| 2 | Benign finding | Normal screening |
| 3 | Probably benign | Short-term follow-up |
| 4 | Suspicious | Biopsy recommended |
| 5 | Highly suggestive of cancer | Biopsy required |
| 6 | Known cancer | Treatment planning |

**Breast Density**

Your mammogram report includes breast density information:

| Density Level | What It Means |
|---------------|---------------|
| A - Almost entirely fatty | Easiest to read, lowest cancer risk from density |
| B - Scattered fibroglandular | Some dense tissue |
| C - Heterogeneously dense | Much of breast is dense |
| D - Extremely dense | Very difficult to read, may hide cancers |

**Why density matters:**
- Dense breasts make mammograms harder to read
- Dense tissue appears white; so does cancer
- Dense breasts have slightly higher cancer risk
- Additional screening may be offered (ultrasound, MRI)

**Benefits and Harms of Mammography**

For every 1,000 women screened every 2 years for 10 years (ages 50-59):

| Outcome | Number |
|---------|--------|
| Breast cancer deaths prevented | 1-2 |
| False positive results | 100-150 |
| Women called back for more imaging | 100-150 |
| Unnecessary biopsies | 10-20 |
| Overdiagnosed cancers | 5-15 |

### Level 4: Advanced Understanding

**Risk-Based Screening Approaches**

**Calculating Your Risk:**

Risk assessment tools consider:
- Age
- Family history of breast cancer
- Personal history of breast biopsies
- Age at first menstruation and menopause
- Age at first childbirth
- Breast density
- Previous radiation therapy to chest

Common risk calculators:
- Gail Model
- Tyrer-Cuzick Model
- BCSC Risk Calculator

**High-Risk Screening**

Women at high risk may need:
- Earlier screening (starting at 25-30)
- Annual mammograms
- Breast MRI in addition to mammography
- More frequent clinical exams

**Who qualifies as high risk:**
- BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers
- Lifetime risk ≥20% by risk models
- Radiation therapy to chest before age 30
- Li-Fraumeni, Cowden, or other genetic syndromes
- Strong family history

**Supplemental Screening Options**

**Breast ultrasound:**
- Uses sound waves, no radiation
- Helpful for dense breasts
- Finds additional cancers mammography misses
- Higher false positive rate

**Breast MRI:**
- Most sensitive test available
- Finds cancers missed by mammography
- Many false positives
- Expensive, requires IV contrast
- Reserved for high-risk women

**Molecular breast imaging:**
- Uses radioactive tracer
- May help with dense breasts
- Not widely available
- Involves radiation exposure

### Level 5: Expert Detail

**Evidence for Mammography Screening**

**Randomized Controlled Trials:**

Eight major RCTs conducted 1963-1991:
- Combined analysis shows ~20% reduction in breast cancer mortality
- Most benefit seen in women 50-69
- Smaller, less certain benefit in women 40-49
- Trials had limitations by modern standards

**Modern evidence challenges:**
- Improvements in treatment reduce screening's relative benefit
- Better awareness leads to earlier symptomatic detection
- Overdiagnosis estimates have increased

**The Controversy Over When to Start**

Arguments for starting at 40:
- Some cancers occur before age 50
- Earlier cancers may be more aggressive
- Many women value the reassurance

Arguments for starting at 50:
- False positives are more common in younger women
- Breast density makes mammograms less accurate
- Overdiagnosis concerns
- Benefits less certain

**Understanding DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma In Situ)**

- Pre-invasive condition found by mammography
- Accounts for ~25% of screen-detected breast abnormalities
- Natural history uncertain
- Many cases may never become invasive cancer
- Treatment is controversial
- Major source of overdiagnosis

**Screening Interval Debate**

Annual vs. Biennial screening:

| Factor | Annual | Biennial |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Cancers detected | More | Fewer |
| False positives | More | Fewer |
| Interval cancers | Fewer | More |
| Radiation exposure | Higher | Lower |
| Mortality reduction | Modest additional | Standard recommendation |

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis:**

- Screening every 2 years ages 50-74: Generally cost-effective
- Annual screening ages 40-84: More expensive per life-year gained
- Dense breast supplemental screening: Uncertain cost-effectiveness
- Risk-based screening: May improve efficiency

**Emerging Technologies:**

- **Contrast-enhanced mammography**: IV contrast improves detection
- **Abbreviated breast MRI**: Shorter, cheaper MRI protocols
- **Artificial intelligence**: Computer assistance in reading mammograms
- **Liquid biopsy**: Blood tests for cancer markers (investigational)

## What to Expect During a Mammogram

### The Procedure

**Before your appointment:**
- Don't wear deodorant, lotion, or powder under arms or on breasts
- Wear a two-piece outfit (you'll undress from the waist up)
- Schedule for when your breasts are least tender (not just before your period)
- Bring prior mammogram images if done elsewhere

**During the exam:**
- You'll stand in front of the mammogram machine
- A technologist positions your breast on a platform
- A plastic plate compresses your breast (necessary for good images)
- Compression lasts only a few seconds per image
- Usually 2 views of each breast (4 images total)
- Takes about 20 minutes total

**The compression:**
- May be uncomfortable but shouldn't be unbearable
- Speak up if the pain is severe
- Compression is necessary to:
  - Spread tissue so abnormalities are visible
  - Hold breast still
  - Reduce radiation dose

**After the exam:**
- You can resume normal activities immediately
- Results usually available within 1-2 weeks
- You'll receive a letter with results
- If something is abnormal, you'll be called for follow-up

## If Your Mammogram Is Abnormal

### Don't Panic

**Remember:**
- Most abnormal mammograms are NOT cancer
- About 10% of screening mammograms require additional testing
- Of those, about 90% are determined to be benign

**What happens next:**

1. **Diagnostic mammogram**: Additional X-ray views focusing on the area of concern

2. **Ultrasound**: May help determine if an abnormality is a solid mass or fluid-filled cyst

3. **Biopsy**: If still concerning, a small tissue sample is taken
   - Needle biopsy is most common
   - Usually done with local anesthesia
   - Results typically take a few days

**Types of findings:**
- **Cyst**: Fluid-filled sac, almost always benign
- **Calcifications**: Tiny calcium deposits, usually benign, sometimes need monitoring
- **Mass**: Solid lump, may need biopsy
- **Asymmetry**: Difference between breasts, often normal variation

---

## Special Considerations

**Breast Implants:**
- Can still have mammograms
- Special techniques used (implant displacement views)
- Tell the technologist about your implants
- May need additional views

**Previous breast cancer:**
- Usually need annual mammography of remaining breast tissue
- May need MRI as well
- More frequent monitoring

**Family history concerns:**
- Tell your doctor about relatives with breast or ovarian cancer
- May qualify for genetic counseling and testing
- May need to start screening earlier
- May benefit from additional tests (MRI)
