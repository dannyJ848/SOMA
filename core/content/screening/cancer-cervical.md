# Cervical Cancer Screening

## Overview

### Level 1: Basic Understanding

**What is cervical cancer screening?**
Tests to find cervical cancer or pre-cancer early, when it's easiest to treat.

**Two main tests:**
- **Pap test (Pap smear)**: Looks for abnormal cells on the cervix
- **HPV test**: Looks for the virus that causes most cervical cancers

**Who should be screened?**
- Women ages 21-65 with a cervix
- Start at age 21, regardless of sexual activity
- Stop at 65 if you've had normal results and adequate screening

**Why it matters:**
Cervical cancer is highly preventable with regular screening. The tests can find problems before cancer develops.

### Level 2: Expanded Information

**Understanding the Cervix and HPV**

The cervix is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina.

**Human Papillomavirus (HPV):**
- A very common sexually transmitted infection
- Most people get HPV at some point in their lives
- Usually clears on its own within 1-2 years
- Certain strains can cause cervical cancer if they persist
- HPV 16 and 18 cause about 70% of cervical cancers

**How cervical cancer develops:**
HPV infection → Persistent infection → Pre-cancer (dysplasia) → Cervical cancer

This process usually takes 10-20 years, which is why screening works so well.

**Current Screening Recommendations**

| Age | Test Options | Frequency |
|-----|--------------|-----------|
| Under 21 | No screening | - |
| 21-29 | Pap test alone | Every 3 years |
| 30-65 | Pap + HPV (co-testing) | Every 5 years |
| 30-65 | HPV test alone | Every 5 years |
| 30-65 | Pap test alone | Every 3 years |
| Over 65 | Usually stop | If adequate prior screening |

**When you may need different screening:**
- HIV positive
- Weakened immune system
- History of cervical pre-cancer or cancer
- DES exposure before birth

### Level 3: Intermediate Detail

**Understanding the Tests**

**Pap Test (Papanicolaou Test):**
- Collects cells from the cervix
- Cells examined under microscope for abnormalities
- Detects pre-cancerous changes (dysplasia)
- Has been used since 1940s
- Reduced cervical cancer deaths by 70%

**HPV Test:**
- Tests for presence of high-risk HPV types
- More sensitive than Pap test alone
- Becoming the preferred primary screening method
- Can detect risk before cell changes are visible

**Pap Test Results**

| Result | Meaning | Next Steps |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Negative (Normal) | No abnormal cells | Routine screening |
| ASC-US | Atypical cells, uncertain significance | Often HPV testing |
| LSIL | Low-grade changes | Colposcopy or monitoring |
| ASC-H | Atypical cells, can't rule out high-grade | Colposcopy |
| HSIL | High-grade changes | Colposcopy |
| AGC | Atypical glandular cells | Colposcopy + additional tests |
| Cancer | Cancer cells seen | Immediate referral |

**HPV Test Results**

| Result | Meaning | Next Steps |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Negative | No high-risk HPV detected | Routine screening |
| Positive | High-risk HPV detected | May need Pap test or colposcopy |
| HPV 16/18 positive | Highest-risk types detected | Colposcopy recommended |

### Level 4: Advanced Understanding

**The Science of Screening Intervals**

**Why not screen every year?**
- Cervical cancer develops slowly (10-20 years)
- Annual screening finds more transient abnormalities
- Most abnormalities regress on their own
- Annual screening leads to more procedures without better outcomes

**Why intervals differ by test:**
- HPV test is more sensitive than Pap
- HPV test has longer "negative predictive value"
- A negative HPV test provides reassurance for 5+ years
- Pap alone misses some abnormalities, needs more frequent testing

**Co-Testing vs. Primary HPV Testing**

| Approach | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Co-testing (Pap + HPV) | Most sensitive, current standard | Two tests, higher cost |
| HPV primary | Similar sensitivity, one test | Requires Pap reflex for positive results |
| Pap alone | Long track record | Less sensitive, more frequent testing |

**Managing Abnormal Results**

**Colposcopy:**
- Examination of cervix with magnifying instrument
- Allows visualization of abnormal areas
- Biopsies taken of suspicious areas
- Done in office with minimal discomfort

**Treatment of Pre-Cancer:**
- LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure): Removes abnormal tissue with wire loop
- Cryotherapy: Freezes abnormal cells
- Cone biopsy: Removes cone-shaped piece of cervix
- These treatments are highly effective at preventing cancer

### Level 5: Expert Detail

**Evidence Base for Screening**

**Historical impact:**
- Before screening: Cervical cancer was leading cause of cancer death in women
- After screening: Incidence and mortality decreased by 70-80%
- Evidence comes primarily from observational studies
- No randomized trials of screening vs. no screening (would be unethical)

**Current evidence questions:**
- Optimal age to start screening
- Optimal interval
- When to stop screening
- Role of HPV testing alone

**HPV Vaccination and Screening**

HPV vaccines (Gardasil 9):
- Protect against HPV 16, 18, and 7 other high-risk types
- Prevent ~90% of cervical cancers
- Most effective if given before sexual activity begins
- Recommended ages 11-12 (can start at 9, catch-up through 26)

**Impact on screening:**
- Vaccinated women still need screening
- May eventually allow longer screening intervals
- Will reduce abnormal Pap results over time
- Full impact will take decades to realize

**Screening in Special Populations**

**After hysterectomy:**
- If cervix removed for benign reasons: No screening needed
- If cervix removed for cancer/pre-cancer: Continue vaginal screening
- If cervix intact (supracervical hysterectomy): Continue cervical screening

**Immunocompromised patients:**
- HIV positive: Screen at diagnosis, then annually if normal
- Organ transplant recipients: Annual screening
- On immunosuppressive therapy: More frequent screening may be needed

**Pregnancy:**
- Screening can be performed during pregnancy
- Colposcopy can be done, but biopsies limited
- Treatment typically delayed until after delivery

**Self-Collection HPV Testing**

Emerging approach:
- Patient collects own vaginal sample
- Tested for high-risk HPV
- Similar sensitivity to clinician-collected samples
- May increase screening access
- Being studied for primary screening

**Cost-Effectiveness Considerations**

Most cost-effective strategies:
1. HPV testing every 5 years (ages 30-65)
2. Co-testing every 5 years (ages 30-65)
3. Pap testing every 3 years (ages 21-65)

Over-screening (more frequent than recommended) increases costs without improving outcomes.

## What to Expect During Screening

### Before Your Appointment

**Timing:**
- Best done when you're not menstruating
- Schedule mid-cycle if possible

**Preparation:**
- No special preparation needed
- Can have normal activities before and after
- May want to avoid intercourse, douching, or vaginal products 48 hours before (not required but may improve sample quality)

### During the Test

**The procedure:**
1. You'll undress from waist down and use a drape
2. Lie on exam table with feet in stirrups
3. Speculum inserted to visualize cervix
4. Small brush or spatula collects cells from cervix
5. Cells placed in liquid for testing
6. Takes about 5 minutes

**What it feels like:**
- Speculum may feel cold or cause pressure
- Cell collection may cause brief cramping
- Usually not painful, but may be uncomfortable
- Tell your provider if you need them to stop or go slower

**After the test:**
- Resume normal activities immediately
- May have light spotting
- Results typically in 1-3 weeks

## If Your Results Are Abnormal

### Don't Panic

**Most abnormalities are NOT cancer:**
- Many resolve on their own
- Pre-cancer takes years to become cancer
- Treatment is highly effective

**What "abnormal" usually means:**
- HPV infection present (very common)
- Mild cell changes that often resolve
- Need for closer monitoring or more tests

### Follow-Up Steps

**For low-risk results (ASC-US, LSIL):**
- May repeat testing in 1 year
- Or have HPV testing to guide next steps
- Colposcopy may be recommended

**For higher-risk results:**
- Colposcopy to look more closely at cervix
- Biopsies of any abnormal areas
- Results determine if treatment needed

**If pre-cancer is found:**
- Treatment removes or destroys abnormal cells
- LEEP is most common treatment
- Done in office with local anesthesia
- Highly effective at preventing cancer
- Regular follow-up needed after treatment

## Special Considerations

**When to Stop Screening**

You may be able to stop at 65 if:
- No history of pre-cancer in last 25 years
- Adequate recent screening (3 negative Paps or 2 negative HPV/co-tests in past 10 years)
- Most recent test within past 5 years

Continue screening if:
- History of cervical pre-cancer
- Immunocompromised
- DES exposure
- Inadequate prior screening

**After Treatment for Pre-Cancer**

- More frequent screening for several years
- HPV testing is key part of follow-up
- If clear for 3-5 years, may return to routine screening
- Never stop screening before age 65 after treatment

## Key Takeaways

1. **Cervical cancer is preventable** - regular screening and HPV vaccination can prevent most cases

2. **Two tests are used** - Pap test looks for abnormal cells, HPV test looks for the virus

3. **Screening starts at 21** - regardless of sexual activity

4. **Don't over-screen** - more frequent testing isn't better and leads to unnecessary procedures

5. **HPV is very common** - most infections clear on their own

6. **Abnormal results usually aren't cancer** - follow-up is important but don't panic

7. **Pre-cancer is highly treatable** - simple procedures prevent cancer

8. **Vaccination helps but doesn't replace screening** - vaccinated women still need screening

9. **You can stop at 65** - if you've had adequate normal screening

10. **Keep up with screening** - don't let an abnormal result deter you from future tests
