# Colorectal Cancer Screening

## Overview

### Level 1: Basic Understanding

**What is colorectal cancer screening?**
Tests to find colon or rectal cancer early, or to find and remove polyps before they become cancer.

**Why it's so important:**
Colorectal cancer is often preventable - screening can actually prevent cancer by removing polyps.

**Main screening options:**
- **Colonoscopy**: Camera exam of entire colon (every 10 years)
- **Stool tests**: Check for blood or DNA in stool (yearly or every 3 years)
- **Other tests**: Flexible sigmoidoscopy, CT colonography

**Who should be screened?**
- Everyone ages 45-75
- Earlier if high risk (family history, certain conditions)
- Discuss with doctor if over 75

### Level 2: Expanded Information

**Understanding the Colon**

The colon (large intestine) and rectum are the final parts of the digestive system:
- Absorbs water and forms stool
- About 5 feet long
- Polyps can grow on the inner lining
- Polyps can develop into cancer over 10-15 years

**Colorectal Cancer Facts:**
- Third most common cancer
- Second leading cause of cancer death
- Highly treatable when caught early
- Often preventable with screening

**Screening Test Options**

**Stool-based tests:**
| Test | What It Does | How Often |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| FIT (Fecal Immunochemical Test) | Detects blood in stool | Every year |
| Guaiac FOBT | Detects blood in stool | Every year |
| FIT-DNA (Cologuard) | Detects blood and DNA markers | Every 3 years |

**Visual exams:**
| Test | What It Does | How Often |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Colonoscopy | Views entire colon with camera | Every 10 years |
| Flexible sigmoidoscopy | Views lower third of colon | Every 5 years |
| CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) | CT scan creates images of colon | Every 5 years |

**Key point:** If a stool test is positive, you need a colonoscopy to follow up.

### Level 3: Intermediate Detail

**Comparing Screening Options**

| Test | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Colonoscopy** | Most thorough, can remove polyps during test, 10-year interval | Requires bowel prep, sedation, rare complications |
| **FIT** | No prep, done at home, no time off work | Must repeat yearly, misses some cancers |
| **FIT-DNA** | No prep, done at home, more sensitive than FIT | More false positives than FIT, every 3 years, expensive |
| **Flex sig** | Less prep than colonoscopy | Only sees part of colon, polyps need colonoscopy follow-up |
| **CT colonography** | No sedation, views entire colon | Requires bowel prep, incidental findings, polyps need colonoscopy |

**The Best Test Is the One You'll Do**

All screening methods reduce colorectal cancer deaths. Choose based on:
- Your preferences
- Your risk level
- Your willingness to do bowel prep
- Access and availability

**Understanding Polyps**

Not all polyps become cancer:
- **Hyperplastic polyps**: Usually not precancerous
- **Adenomatous polyps (adenomas)**: Can become cancer
- **Sessile serrated polyps**: Can become cancer

Polyp characteristics that increase cancer risk:
- Larger size (especially >1 cm)
- More polyps
- Villous features on pathology
- High-grade dysplasia

**Follow-Up After Colonoscopy**

Your next colonoscopy timing depends on findings:

| Finding | Next Colonoscopy |
|---------|------------------|
| No polyps | 10 years |
| 1-2 small adenomas (<10mm) | 7-10 years |
| 3-4 small adenomas | 3-5 years |
| 5-10 adenomas | 3 years |
| Adenoma ≥10mm | 3 years |
| Adenoma with high-grade dysplasia or villous features | 3 years |
| Serrated polyps | Varies by size and type |

### Level 4: Advanced Understanding

**Risk Stratification**

**Average risk:**
- No personal history of polyps or colorectal cancer
- No family history
- No inflammatory bowel disease
- No hereditary syndrome

**Increased risk (earlier/more frequent screening):**

| Risk Factor | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| First-degree relative with CRC or advanced adenoma <60 | Start at 40 or 10 years before youngest case, every 5 years |
| First-degree relative with CRC ≥60 | Start at 40, every 10 years |
| Personal history of adenomas | Based on findings (see above) |
| Inflammatory bowel disease | Surveillance colonoscopy 8 years after diagnosis |
| Lynch syndrome | Start at 20-25, every 1-2 years |
| FAP | Start at 10-12, yearly (may need surgery) |

**Hereditary Syndromes**

**Lynch Syndrome (Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer):**
- Accounts for 2-4% of colorectal cancers
- Caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes
- 50-80% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer
- Also increases risk of endometrial, ovarian, stomach, and other cancers
- Colonoscopy every 1-2 years starting at 20-25

**Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP):**
- Hundreds to thousands of polyps develop
- Near 100% chance of cancer without treatment
- Usually requires surgical removal of colon
- Screening starts in childhood

**Quality Measures in Colonoscopy**

Not all colonoscopies are equal. Quality indicators:

- **Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR)**: Percentage of colonoscopies that find at least one adenoma
  - Target: ≥25% overall, ≥30% in men, ≥20% in women
  - Higher ADR associated with lower interval cancer rates

- **Cecal intubation rate**: Percentage of exams that reach the beginning of the colon
  - Target: ≥95%

- **Withdrawal time**: Time spent examining during withdrawal
  - Target: ≥6 minutes in normal exams

- **Bowel preparation quality**: Adequate prep needed for good visualization

### Level 5: Expert Detail

**Evidence for Screening**

**Randomized controlled trials:**
- Guaiac FOBT: 15-33% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality
- Sigmoidoscopy: 21-26% reduction in mortality
- Colonoscopy trials ongoing; observational data strongly supportive

**Modeling studies:**
- All recommended strategies provide similar life-years gained
- Colonoscopy every 10 years most efficient
- FIT yearly offers comparable benefit

**The Screening Cascade**

Understanding the pathway from screening to benefit:

1. Adequate participation (people actually getting screened)
2. Quality of the screening test
3. Appropriate follow-up of positive results
4. Quality of the diagnostic colonoscopy
5. Complete polypectomy
6. Appropriate surveillance intervals
7. Patient adherence to surveillance

Failure at any step reduces effectiveness.

**Emerging Technologies**

**Blood-based screening:**
- Tests for circulating tumor DNA or methylation markers
- Convenience of blood draw
- Currently less sensitive than FIT or colonoscopy
- FDA-approved options becoming available
- May improve participation rates

**Artificial intelligence:**
- Computer-assisted polyp detection during colonoscopy
- May improve adenoma detection
- Increasingly being adopted

**Capsule endoscopy:**
- Swallowed camera captures images
- Currently not recommended for screening
- May have future role

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Most screening strategies are cost-effective compared to no screening:
- Colonoscopy every 10 years
- FIT every year
- FIT-DNA every 3 years
- Sigmoidoscopy every 5 years with FIT every year

Key factors:
- Screening participation rates
- Follow-up colonoscopy for positive stool tests
- Quality of colonoscopy

**Controversies and Evolving Guidelines**

**Age to start screening:**
- Previously 50, now 45 based on rising rates in younger adults
- Some debate about strength of evidence for 45-49

**Age to stop screening:**
- 75-85: Individual decision based on health and preferences
- Over 85: Generally not recommended
- Consider life expectancy and prior screening history

**Choosing between options:**
- Guidelines present options as equivalent
- Some experts prefer colonoscopy for its ability to prevent cancer
- Others prioritize patient preference and participation

## Preparing for Colonoscopy

### The Bowel Preparation

**Why prep is needed:**
- Colon must be clean for good visualization
- Poor prep means missed polyps
- May need to repeat procedure if prep inadequate

**Typical prep involves:**
- Low-fiber diet 1-3 days before
- Clear liquids only the day before
- Drinking large volume of laxative solution
- Spending time near the bathroom

**Tips for easier prep:**
- Keep prep solution cold
- Use a straw
- Drink at a steady pace (not too fast or slow)
- Clear flavored beverages can help
- Stay near the bathroom once you start
- Use wet wipes and barrier cream

**Split-dose prep** (half the evening before, half the morning of) is more effective and often easier to tolerate.

### The Day of Colonoscopy

**Before:**
- Nothing to eat or drink morning of (usually)
- Arrange for a driver
- Wear comfortable clothes
- Plan for time off from work

**During:**
- IV placed for sedation
- Procedure takes 30-60 minutes
- You'll be sedated (conscious sedation or deeper anesthesia)
- Most people don't remember the procedure
- Polyps removed if found

**After:**
- Recovery for 30-60 minutes
- May feel bloated or pass gas
- Can eat after procedure
- No driving, important decisions, or work for rest of day
- Results of polyp removal usually take a few days

## Understanding Your Results

### Colonoscopy Findings

**"Normal" colonoscopy:**
- No polyps found
- Next screening in 10 years (average risk)

**Polyps found:**
- Most are removed during the procedure
- Sent to pathology for analysis
- Follow-up interval based on findings

**Questions to ask:**
- How many polyps were found?
- What size were they?
- What type were they?
- Were they completely removed?
- When do I need my next colonoscopy?

### Stool Test Results

**Negative FIT:**
- No blood detected
- Continue annual testing
- Still watch for symptoms

**Positive FIT:**
- Blood detected
- MUST have colonoscopy follow-up
- Most positive FITs are NOT cancer
- Could be polyps, hemorrhoids, or other causes
- Colonoscopy needed to find the cause

---

## Warning Signs to Watch For

Don't wait for screening if you have symptoms:

- Blood in stool or rectal bleeding
- Change in bowel habits lasting more than a few days
- Unexplained weight loss
- Persistent abdominal pain or cramping
- Feeling that bowel doesn't empty completely
- Weakness or fatigue
- Unexplained iron deficiency anemia

These symptoms need evaluation, not screening.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Screening saves lives AND prevents cancer** - polyp removal prevents cancer from developing

2. **Start at 45** - or earlier if you have risk factors

3. **Several options exist** - colonoscopy isn't the only choice

4. **The best test is the one you'll do** - pick something and stick with it

5. **Positive stool tests need colonoscopy** - don't skip the follow-up

6. **Family history matters** - tell your doctor about relatives with colorectal cancer

7. **Colonoscopy quality varies** - ask about adenoma detection rates

8. **Don't fear the prep** - it's temporary and manageable

9. **Keep up with surveillance** - if you've had polyps, follow recommended intervals

10. **Don't ignore symptoms** - screening is for people without symptoms
