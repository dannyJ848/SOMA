# Lung Cancer Screening

## Overview

### Level 1: Basic Understanding

**What is lung cancer screening?**
Using a special CT scan to look for lung cancer early, before symptoms appear.

**The test:**
- **Low-dose CT (LDCT)** scan of the chest
- Takes about 15 minutes
- No IV contrast needed
- Looks for nodules (spots) in the lungs

**Who should be screened?**
- Ages 50-80
- Currently smoke OR quit within the past 15 years
- Have a significant smoking history (20+ pack-years)
- Reasonably good health

**Pack-years calculation:**
Packs per day × Years smoked = Pack-years
Example: 1 pack/day × 25 years = 25 pack-years

### Level 2: Expanded Information

**Why Lung Cancer Screening Matters**

**Lung cancer facts:**
- Leading cause of cancer death in the US
- More deaths than colon, breast, and prostate cancers combined
- Often diagnosed at late stage when cure is difficult
- When caught early, survival is much better

**The challenge:**
- Symptoms (cough, shortness of breath) appear late
- By the time symptoms occur, cancer is often advanced
- Need a way to find cancer earlier

**Current Eligibility Criteria (USPSTF 2021)**

Must meet ALL of these:
- Age 50-80 years
- 20+ pack-year smoking history
- Currently smoke OR quit within past 15 years
- Willing and able to have treatment if cancer found
- No symptoms that might indicate lung cancer

**When to stop screening:**
- Age 80
- Haven't smoked in 15+ years
- Health problems that limit treatment options or life expectancy

**Benefits and Harms**

For every 1,000 people screened over 3 years:

| Outcome | Number |
|---------|--------|
| Lives saved from lung cancer | 3-4 |
| False positive results | 200-300 |
| People needing follow-up CT scans | 150-200 |
| People needing biopsy or other procedures | 20-30 |
| Major complications from procedures | 2-5 |

### Level 3: Intermediate Detail

**Evidence for Lung Cancer Screening**

**National Lung Screening Trial (NLST):**
- 53,000 participants
- Compared LDCT vs. chest X-ray
- 20% reduction in lung cancer deaths with LDCT
- 6.7% reduction in overall mortality
- First screening method proven to reduce lung cancer deaths

**NELSON Trial (European):**
- 15,800 participants
- Confirmed NLST findings
- 24% reduction in lung cancer deaths in men
- 33% reduction in women

**Who Benefits Most:**
- People at highest risk (more pack-years, current smokers)
- Those who would be candidates for treatment
- Those who follow through with recommended imaging

**Understanding CT Results**

**Lung nodules:**
- Small spots on the lung
- Very common - most are benign
- Size, appearance, and change over time determine significance

**Lung-RADS Reporting System:**

| Category | Meaning | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Negative - no nodules | Annual LDCT |
| 2 | Benign appearance | Annual LDCT |
| 3 | Probably benign | 6-month follow-up LDCT |
| 4A | Suspicious | 3-month LDCT or PET-CT |
| 4B | Suspicious | Chest CT with contrast, PET-CT, biopsy |
| 4X | Suspicious, high probability | Prompt evaluation/biopsy |

**Most nodules found are NOT cancer:**
- 96% of positive screening results are false positives
- Most require only follow-up imaging
- Few require invasive procedures

### Level 4: Advanced Understanding

**Calculating Your Risk**

**Risk models consider:**
- Age
- Smoking history (pack-years)
- Years since quitting
- Personal history of cancer
- Family history of lung cancer
- Presence of emphysema/COPD
- BMI

**PLCOm2012 Model:**
Used to estimate 6-year risk of lung cancer
Some guidelines use ≥1.3% 6-year risk as threshold for screening

**Individual vs. Universal Criteria:**
- Current US guidelines use fixed criteria (age, pack-years)
- Risk models may better identify who benefits
- Some people who don't meet criteria still benefit
- Some who meet criteria have low actual risk

**Balancing Harms**

**False positives:**
- Very common (20-30% of people screened)
- Most resolved with follow-up imaging
- Cause anxiety and worry
- Can lead to unnecessary procedures

**Overdiagnosis:**
- Some detected cancers might never have caused harm
- Estimated 10-25% of screen-detected cancers
- Treatment has real side effects

**Radiation exposure:**
- Low-dose CT uses less radiation than standard CT
- Still more than chest X-ray
- Cumulative exposure with annual screening
- Estimated very small additional cancer risk

**Incidental findings:**
- Scans may find other abnormalities
- Coronary artery calcification (common)
- Thyroid nodules
- Adrenal masses
- Lead to additional tests and worry

### Level 5: Expert Detail

**Screening Program Requirements**

**ACR-designated lung cancer screening centers must have:**
- Radiologists experienced in chest CT
- Low-dose CT capability
- Lung-RADS reporting
- Registry participation
- Smoking cessation resources
- Multidisciplinary tumor board

**Quality Metrics:**
- Adherence to imaging protocols
- Proper documentation
- Smoking cessation counseling rates
- Adherence to follow-up recommendations
- Complication rates

**The Smoking Cessation Connection**

**Critical component of screening:**
- Screening should include smoking cessation counseling
- Quitting smoking provides MORE benefit than screening
- Screening is not a substitute for quitting
- "Teachable moment" for cessation intervention

**Impact on screening benefit:**
- Continuing to smoke reduces the benefit
- Quitting after positive scan is particularly important
- Never too late to quit

**Cost-Effectiveness**

LDCT lung cancer screening is considered cost-effective:
- Comparable to breast and colon cancer screening
- Most cost-effective in highest-risk individuals
- Depends on adherence to appropriate follow-up

**Factors affecting cost-effectiveness:**
- False positive rate
- Cost of follow-up procedures
- Smoking cessation integration
- Appropriate patient selection

**Emerging Directions**

**Expanding eligibility:**
- Some argue criteria are too restrictive
- Miss many lung cancers in people who don't qualify
- Risk models may allow personalized eligibility

**Biomarkers:**
- Blood-based tests for early detection
- May complement LDCT
- Currently investigational

**Artificial intelligence:**
- Computer-assisted nodule detection
- Risk stratification of nodules
- May reduce false positives

**Screening disparities:**
- Uptake is low (~5-15% of eligible population)
- Lower in rural areas, communities of color
- Access barriers to screening centers

## What to Expect During Screening

### Before the Scan

**Eligibility verification:**
- Your doctor will confirm you meet criteria
- Discussion of benefits and harms (shared decision making)
- Required for insurance coverage

**Shared decision making visit:**
- Benefits and limitations of screening
- Your individual risk
- Commitment to follow-up if needed
- Smoking cessation discussion

**No special preparation:**
- No need to fast
- No IV contrast
- No breath-holding required for some scanners
- Takes about 15 minutes

### During the Scan

**The procedure:**
1. Lie on CT table on your back
2. Arms above your head
3. Brief breath hold (less than 10 seconds)
4. Machine takes images of your chest
5. Done in one pass

**What it's like:**
- Painless
- Quick (actual scan takes seconds)
- May feel slightly confined (open-ended tube)
- Hear humming and clicking sounds

### After the Scan

**Getting results:**
- Usually within a few days to a week
- May be reported as Lung-RADS category
- Your doctor will explain what results mean
- Most results require only annual follow-up

---

## Understanding Your Results

### "Negative" or Category 1-2

**What it means:**
- No concerning nodules found
- Continue annual screening

**What to do:**
- Schedule next LDCT in 12 months
- Continue working on smoking cessation if applicable
- Report any new symptoms to your doctor

### "Positive" or Category 3+

**What it means:**
- A nodule was found that needs attention
- NOT necessarily cancer (most are not)

**What happens next:**
- Category 3: Repeat CT in 6 months
- Category 4: Additional imaging, possible PET scan, possible biopsy

**Key points:**
- Don't panic
- Most positive results turn out to be benign
- Follow through with recommended follow-up
- Earlier detection, if cancer, means better outcomes

---

## Special Considerations

**If You Don't Quite Meet Criteria**

You might still consider discussing screening if:
- You're close to 20 pack-years
- You quit slightly more than 15 years ago
- You have other risk factors (family history, occupational exposures)

Some centers use risk calculators rather than strict criteria.

**If You Have Symptoms**

Screening is for people WITHOUT symptoms.

Seek medical evaluation (not screening) if you have:
- Persistent cough
- Coughing up blood
- Unexplained weight loss
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain

**If You've Never Smoked**

Current guidelines don't recommend screening for never-smokers, even with:
- Family history
- Secondhand smoke exposure
- Occupational exposures

The benefit-harm balance is different, though this is an area of ongoing research.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Screening saves lives** - proven to reduce lung cancer deaths by 20%

2. **Only for high-risk smokers** - specific eligibility criteria must be met

3. **Low-dose CT is the test** - quick, painless, no contrast needed

4. **Most findings are not cancer** - expect false positives and follow-up imaging

5. **Shared decision making required** - discuss benefits and harms with your doctor

6. **Smoking cessation is essential** - quitting provides more benefit than screening

7. **Annual screening needed** - one normal scan doesn't mean you're done

8. **Follow-up is critical** - if nodules are found, get recommended follow-up

9. **Screening doesn't prevent lung cancer** - only quitting smoking does that

10. **Uptake is too low** - if you're eligible, get screened
