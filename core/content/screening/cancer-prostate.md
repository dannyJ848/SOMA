# Prostate Cancer Screening

## Overview

### Level 1: Basic Understanding

**What is prostate cancer screening?**
A blood test to check for signs of prostate cancer.

**The main test:**
- **PSA test** (Prostate-Specific Antigen)
- A simple blood draw
- Measures PSA level in blood

**Why is this controversial?**
- The test finds many cancers that would never cause harm
- Treatment has significant side effects
- Unclear if screening saves lives

**The recommendation:**
Men ages 55-69 should **talk with their doctor** about whether PSA screening is right for them.

### Level 2: Expanded Information

**Understanding the Prostate**

The prostate is a gland below the bladder that:
- Makes fluid that's part of semen
- Surrounds the urethra (tube that carries urine)
- Commonly grows larger with age

**Prostate Cancer Facts:**
- Very common (1 in 8 men diagnosed)
- Usually grows slowly
- Many men die WITH prostate cancer, not FROM it
- When aggressive, can be life-threatening

**How PSA Screening Works**

PSA is a protein made by prostate cells:
- Higher PSA may indicate cancer
- But many things can raise PSA:
  - Enlarged prostate (BPH)
  - Prostate infection
  - Recent ejaculation
  - Riding a bicycle
  - Normal variation

**What PSA levels mean:**

| PSA Level | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Below 4 ng/mL | Generally considered "normal" |
| 4-10 ng/mL | "Gray zone" - about 25% chance of cancer |
| Above 10 ng/mL | Higher concern - about 50% chance of cancer |

**But there's no "safe" PSA - cancer can be found at any level.**

### Level 3: Intermediate Detail

**The Prostate Cancer Screening Controversy**

**Arguments FOR screening:**
- Can find cancer early
- Early treatment may prevent death
- Peace of mind from normal results
- Some aggressive cancers found and cured

**Arguments AGAINST screening:**
- Finds many cancers that would never cause harm (overdiagnosis)
- Treatment has serious side effects
- Randomized trials show uncertain mortality benefit
- Many men undergo unnecessary biopsies
- Significant anxiety from elevated PSA

**Evidence from Major Trials**

| Trial | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| PLCO (US) | No mortality benefit from screening |
| ERSPC (Europe) | 20% reduction in prostate cancer death, but high overdiagnosis |

**Interpretation:**
- To save 1 life from prostate cancer death:
  - Need to screen ~1,000 men
  - Need to treat ~30-40 men
- Many treated men would never have had problems from their cancer

**Current Recommendations**

| Organization | Recommendation |
|--------------|----------------|
| USPSTF | Ages 55-69: Individual decision after discussion |
| American Cancer Society | Discuss at 50 (earlier if high risk) |
| American Urological Association | Shared decision making ages 55-69 |

**Common theme:** Shared decision making, not routine screening

### Level 4: Advanced Understanding

**What Happens If PSA Is Elevated**

**Not all elevated PSAs lead to biopsy:**

1. **Repeat PSA**: Confirm elevation wasn't temporary
2. **Consider factors**: Age, race, family history, PSA velocity
3. **Digital rectal exam (DRE)**: Check for abnormalities
4. **Free PSA**: Lower free PSA suggests higher cancer risk
5. **PSA density**: PSA divided by prostate size
6. **Biomarkers**: PHI, 4Kscore, PCA3, Select MDx
7. **MRI**: Can identify suspicious areas

**Prostate biopsy:**
- Multiple needle samples of prostate tissue
- Done through rectum or through skin (perineum)
- Risks: bleeding, infection, discomfort
- May miss cancer (sampling error)

**MRI-Targeted Biopsy:**
- MRI identifies suspicious areas first
- Biopsy targeted to those areas
- May reduce unnecessary biopsies
- May find more significant cancers

**Understanding Prostate Cancer Grades**

**Gleason Score** (being replaced by Grade Groups):
- Pathologist rates cancer aggressiveness (6-10)
- Higher score = more aggressive

**Grade Groups:**
| Group | Gleason | Risk |
|-------|---------|------|
| 1 | 6 | Low risk |
| 2 | 3+4=7 | Favorable intermediate |
| 3 | 4+3=7 | Unfavorable intermediate |
| 4 | 8 | High |
| 5 | 9-10 | Very high |

**The Overdiagnosis Problem**

Many detected cancers would never cause symptoms:
- 20-50% of screen-detected cancers are overdiagnosed
- Can't tell which individual cancer will progress
- Leads to unnecessary treatment

**Active Surveillance:**
- Monitoring low-risk cancer without immediate treatment
- Regular PSA tests, possible repeat biopsies
- Treatment if cancer progresses
- Reduces overtreatment
- Requires psychological acceptance of "watching" cancer

### Level 5: Expert Detail

**PSA Kinetics and Risk Stratification**

**PSA velocity:**
- Rate of PSA change over time
- Rapid rise may indicate aggressive cancer
- Threshold: >0.75 ng/mL per year concerning

**PSA doubling time:**
- How long for PSA to double
- Shorter doubling time = more aggressive cancer

**Baseline PSA:**
- Men with PSA <1 at age 60 have very low lifetime risk
- May be able to reduce screening frequency

**Novel Biomarkers**

| Test | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| PHI (Prostate Health Index) | Combines PSA forms to improve specificity |
| 4Kscore | Blood test predicting aggressive cancer |
| PCA3 | Urine test for prostate cancer gene |
| Select MDx | Urine test for high-grade cancer |
| ConfirmMDx | Tissue test after negative biopsy |
| Oncotype DX GPS | Predicts tumor aggressiveness |
| Decipher | Genomic classifier for prognosis |

**MRI in the Diagnostic Pathway**

**PI-RADS scoring:**
| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 1-2 | Very unlikely to be significant cancer |
| 3 | Equivocal |
| 4-5 | Likely clinically significant cancer |

**MRI-first approach:**
- MRI before biopsy
- May avoid biopsy in low PI-RADS
- Target suspicious areas with biopsy
- Reduces detection of insignificant cancer

**Treatment Side Effects**

**Radical prostatectomy:**
- Erectile dysfunction: 20-70%
- Urinary incontinence: 5-20%
- Surgical risks

**Radiation therapy:**
- Erectile dysfunction: 20-50%
- Bowel problems: 5-10%
- Urinary symptoms

**Active surveillance:**
- Anxiety from monitoring
- Possible progression
- May need delayed treatment

**Cost-Effectiveness Considerations**

- Screening is NOT cost-effective by traditional metrics
- Very high cost per life-year gained
- Dominated by overtreatment costs
- Risk-adapted strategies may improve efficiency

**Personalized Screening Approaches**

**Risk-based screening:**
- Consider family history
- African American men at higher risk (start earlier?)
- Use baseline PSA to guide future screening
- Biomarkers to reduce unnecessary biopsies

**Polygenic risk scores:**
- Multiple genetic variants affect prostate cancer risk
- May help identify who benefits from screening
- Currently research/limited clinical use

## Making Your Decision

### Questions to Consider

**Your values:**
- How do you feel about detecting a cancer that might never harm you?
- How would you feel about living with untreated cancer (active surveillance)?
- How important is avoiding the side effects of treatment?
- How do you feel about uncertainty?

**Your risk factors:**
- Do you have a family history of prostate cancer?
- Are you African American? (higher risk)
- Do you have genetic factors (BRCA1/2)?
- What is your overall health and life expectancy?

**Questions for your doctor:**
- Given my risk factors, what's my chance of prostate cancer?
- If I have an elevated PSA, what are the next steps?
- What are the chances a biopsy would find cancer?
- What are the chances I'd be treated for a cancer that would never have harmed me?
- What are my options if cancer is found?

### Scenarios

**"I want to know everything":**
- Annual PSA starting at 50 (or earlier if high risk)
- Accept that elevated PSA leads to more tests
- If cancer found, consider all options including active surveillance
- Understand you may be treated for a cancer that wouldn't have caused harm

**"I want to avoid unnecessary treatment":**
- Discuss PSA screening carefully
- If screened and cancer found, strongly consider active surveillance for low-risk disease
- Understand that very rarely, surveillance could miss window for cure

**"I prefer to avoid screening":**
- Acceptable option, especially with shorter life expectancy
- Still report symptoms (urination problems, blood in urine, bone pain)
- Can change your mind later

## High-Risk Groups

### African American Men

- 1.7 times more likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer
- 2.2 times more likely to die from prostate cancer
- Cancer may occur at younger ages
- Earlier screening discussions (starting at 40-45) may be appropriate

### Family History

**Consider earlier screening if:**
- Father or brother with prostate cancer (especially if diagnosed young)
- Multiple family members affected
- Family history of aggressive prostate cancer

### Genetic Factors

**BRCA2 mutation:**
- Higher risk of aggressive prostate cancer
- Screening starting at age 40 recommended

**BRCA1 mutation:**
- Modestly increased risk
- Consider earlier screening

**Lynch syndrome:**
- Some increased prostate cancer risk
- May consider earlier screening
