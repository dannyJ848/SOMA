# Skin Cancer Screening

## Overview

### Level 1: Basic Understanding

**What is skin cancer screening?**
Checking your skin for signs of skin cancer before symptoms become serious.

**Two approaches:**
- **Self-exams**: You check your own skin regularly
- **Clinical skin exams**: A healthcare provider examines your skin

**Why it matters:**
Skin cancer is the most common cancer, but when found early, it's highly treatable.

**Current recommendations:**
- Self-awareness: Know your skin and report changes
- Clinical exams: Not routinely recommended for everyone, but may help for high-risk individuals
- Protect your skin: Prevention is key

### Level 2: Expanded Information

**Types of Skin Cancer**

**Melanoma:**
- Most dangerous type
- Can spread to other organs
- About 100,000 new cases per year in US
- When caught early, 5-year survival >99%
- When caught late, survival drops dramatically

**Basal cell carcinoma (BCC):**
- Most common type
- Rarely spreads
- Can cause local damage if untreated

**Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC):**
- Second most common
- Can spread if not treated
- Usually curable when caught early

**The ABCDEs of Melanoma**

Warning signs to look for:

| Letter | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **A** - Asymmetry | One half doesn't match the other |
| **B** - Border | Edges are irregular, ragged, or blurred |
| **C** - Color | Color is not uniform - different shades of brown, black, or other colors |
| **D** - Diameter | Larger than a pencil eraser (6mm), though melanomas can be smaller |
| **E** - Evolving | Size, shape, or color is changing |

**The "Ugly Duckling" Sign:**
A mole that looks different from all your other moles deserves attention.

**Current Screening Recommendations**

| Organization | Recommendation |
|--------------|----------------|
| USPSTF | Insufficient evidence to recommend for/against routine skin exams |
| American Cancer Society | No specific guidelines for general population |
| AAD | Monthly self-exams, annual dermatologist exam for high-risk |
| Skin Cancer Foundation | Monthly self-exams, annual professional exam |

### Level 3: Intermediate Detail

**Why No Clear Screening Recommendation?**

**The challenges:**
- No randomized trials proving screening reduces melanoma deaths
- Most detected melanomas would have been found anyway (symptoms)
- Concern about overdiagnosis of melanomas that wouldn't have caused harm
- Skin exams have high false positive rates

**The counterarguments:**
- Early melanomas are highly curable
- Late melanomas are often fatal
- Countries with screening programs have seen mortality decline
- Low harm from visual inspection

**Who Is High Risk?**

Consider more intensive surveillance if you have:
- Personal history of melanoma
- Many moles (50+ typical moles or atypical moles)
- Family history of melanoma (especially first-degree relatives)
- History of blistering sunburns
- Fair skin that burns easily
- Red or blonde hair, blue eyes
- History of using tanning beds
- Weakened immune system
- History of basal or squamous cell skin cancer

**How to Do a Self-Exam**

**What you need:**
- Well-lit room
- Full-length mirror
- Hand mirror
- Partner (for hard-to-see areas)

**Steps:**
1. **Face and scalp**: Use mirrors, part hair to see scalp
2. **Hands and arms**: Check palms, between fingers, under nails, arm pits
3. **Torso**: Front, back, sides
4. **Legs**: Front and back, between toes, soles of feet
5. **Back**: Use mirrors or have partner help

**When to do it:**
- Monthly
- Same time each month so you remember
- Note any new or changing spots

### Level 4: Advanced Understanding

**Clinical Skin Examination**

**What happens during a skin exam:**
- Undress completely (or wear exam gown)
- Provider examines all skin surfaces
- Magnification may be used (dermatoscopy)
- Suspicious lesions may be biopsied

**Dermoscopy:**
- Magnified, lit examination of skin lesions
- Improves accuracy of melanoma detection
- Reduces unnecessary biopsies
- Requires training to use effectively

**Total body photography:**
- Photos of entire skin surface
- Used for comparison at future visits
- Helps detect new or changing lesions
- Particularly useful for patients with many moles

**Understanding Biopsies**

If a suspicious lesion is found:
- Biopsy removes all or part of the lesion
- Pathologist examines under microscope
- Determines if cancer is present and what type
- Guides treatment decisions

**Types of biopsies:**
- Shave biopsy: Thin slice of lesion
- Punch biopsy: Small circular sample
- Excisional biopsy: Entire lesion removed

**Melanoma Staging**

If melanoma is diagnosed:

| Stage | Meaning | 5-Year Survival |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| 0 (in situ) | Confined to epidermis | ~99% |
| I | Thin, no spread | 95-99% |
| II | Thicker, no spread | 80-90% |
| III | Spread to lymph nodes | 40-78% |
| IV | Distant spread | 15-30% |

**This is why early detection matters** - survival difference between early and late stage is dramatic.

### Level 5: Expert Detail

**Evidence for Screening**

**The evidence gap:**
- No randomized trials of screening vs. no screening
- Would need to follow thousands of people for decades
- Likely never to be done

**Observational evidence:**
- Screening detects thinner melanomas
- Thinner melanomas have better survival
- But lead time and length bias may explain some of this

**Ecologic studies:**
- Germany introduced skin cancer screening 2008
- Initial reports showed decreased mortality
- Later analyses questioned the benefit
- Potential for overdiagnosis

**The Overdiagnosis Concern**

**Evidence for overdiagnosis:**
- Melanoma incidence has increased dramatically
- Mortality has not increased proportionally
- Many "melanomas" found today may never have caused harm
- Increasing detection of thin, early lesions

**Counter-evidence:**
- Treatment improvements may explain stable mortality
- Sun exposure changes may be factor
- Some thin melanomas do progress
- Can't identify which will progress

**Consensus:**
- Some overdiagnosis occurs
- Exact magnitude unknown
- Individual harms are real (anxiety, unnecessary surgery)
- Population benefit uncertain

**Risk Stratification Approaches**

**Genetic factors:**
- CDKN2A mutations increase melanoma risk 60-90%
- MC1R variants affect risk
- Polygenic risk scores in development

**Phenotypic factors:**
- Fitzpatrick skin type (I-VI, lighter = higher risk)
- Total mole count
- Atypical mole syndrome

**Risk calculators:**
- Combine multiple factors
- Help identify who needs surveillance
- Not widely used in practice

**Technology in Skin Cancer Detection**

**Artificial intelligence:**
- Computer algorithms analyze skin images
- Some perform as well as dermatologists
- May improve access to expert evaluation
- Apps available for smartphone screening
- Quality varies widely

**Teledermatology:**
- Remote evaluation of skin images
- May improve access
- Store-and-forward vs. live video
- Concerns about image quality

**Confocal microscopy:**
- Non-invasive cellular imaging
- May reduce unnecessary biopsies
- Limited availability

## Skin Cancer Prevention

### Sun Protection (Most Important)

**The basics:**
- Seek shade, especially 10am-4pm
- Wear protective clothing
- Use broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen
- Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours (more if swimming/sweating)
- Wear sunglasses
- Avoid tanning beds

**Sunscreen tips:**
- Apply 15 minutes before sun exposure
- Use about 1 ounce (shot glass) for full body
- Don't forget ears, lips, top of feet, back of neck
- Water-resistant doesn't mean waterproof

**Clothing:**
- Tightly woven fabrics
- Darker colors provide more protection
- UPF-rated clothing available
- Wide-brimmed hats

### Vitamin D Concerns

**The dilemma:**
- Sun exposure produces vitamin D
- Vitamin D is important for health
- But sun causes skin cancer

**The solution:**
- Get vitamin D from diet or supplements
- Food sources: fatty fish, fortified milk, eggs
- Most adults need 600-800 IU daily
- Sun exposure not needed for vitamin D

## What to Report to Your Doctor

### See Your Doctor Soon If You Notice:

- A new mole or growth that looks different from your others
- A mole that's changing in size, shape, or color
- A mole that's asymmetric, has irregular borders, multiple colors, or is large
- A spot that's itching, bleeding, or crusting
- A sore that doesn't heal within a few weeks
- A new dark area under a fingernail or toenail

### Describe Changes Specifically:

- When did you first notice it?
- How has it changed?
- Does it itch, bleed, or hurt?
