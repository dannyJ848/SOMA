# Condom Use Guide

> Patient Education: STI Prevention

## Overview

Condoms are one of the most effective and accessible methods for preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. This guide covers proper selection, use, and troubleshooting for maximum protection.

## Complexity Level 1: Basic Understanding

### What Are Condoms?

Condoms are thin barriers worn during sex that prevent body fluids from passing between partners.

### Types of Condoms

- **External condoms** - worn on the penis
- **Internal condoms** - inserted into the vagina or anus

### Why Use Condoms?

- Prevent pregnancy
- Protect against most STIs
- No prescription needed
- Inexpensive and widely available

### Basic Steps for External Condoms

1. Check expiration date
2. Open carefully (not with teeth)
3. Pinch tip and roll down
4. Use lubricant if needed
5. Remove carefully after sex
6. Throw away (never reuse)

## Complexity Level 2: Fundamental Concepts

### Choosing the Right Condom

#### Materials

| Material | STI Protection | Latex Allergy Safe | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| Latex | Yes | No | Most common; strong |
| Polyurethane | Yes | Yes | Thinner; less stretchy |
| Polyisoprene | Yes | Yes | Similar feel to latex |
| Lambskin | No (porous) | Yes | Only prevents pregnancy |

#### Size Matters

Using the wrong size increases failure risk:
- **Too tight**: More likely to break
- **Too loose**: May slip off
- Measure circumference to find proper fit
- Many brands offer size guides

#### Features

- **Lubricated**: Pre-coated for comfort
- **Ribbed/textured**: For increased sensation
- **Ultra-thin**: Enhanced sensitivity
- **Spermicide-coated**: Not recommended (can cause irritation)

### Step-by-Step External Condom Use

**Before:**
1. Store in cool, dry place (not wallet long-term)
2. Check expiration date
3. Look for damage to wrapper
4. Open at corner, push condom away from edge

**During application:**
1. Make sure penis is erect
2. Determine which way condom unrolls (tip should point out)
3. Pinch reservoir tip to leave space for semen
4. Roll down to base of penis
5. Smooth out air bubbles

**During sex:**
1. Add lubricant to outside if needed (water or silicone-based only)
2. Check periodically that condom is still in place

**After sex:**
1. Withdraw while still erect
2. Hold base of condom while withdrawing
3. Remove away from partner's body
4. Tie off and dispose in trash (not toilet)
5. Never reuse

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Using expired condoms
- Using oil-based lubricants with latex
- Putting on after starting sex
- Not leaving space at tip
- Not holding base during withdrawal
- Using two condoms (creates friction, increases breakage)

## Complexity Level 3: Detailed Knowledge

### Internal (Female) Condoms

#### Advantages
- Can be inserted up to 8 hours before sex
- Partner doesn't need to be erect
- Made of nitrile (latex-free)
- Covers more external area

#### How to Use

**Insertion:**
1. Find comfortable position (standing with one foot raised, squatting, or lying down)
2. Squeeze inner ring and insert like a tampon
3. Push inner ring past pubic bone
4. Outer ring stays outside vagina, covering labia

**For anal use:**
1. Remove inner ring
2. Insert condom with finger or applicator
3. Outer ring stays outside anus

**During and after:**
1. Guide penis into condom opening
2. After sex, twist outer ring to keep fluids inside
3. Pull out gently and dispose

### Lubricant Guidelines

**Why use lubricant:**
- Reduces friction and breakage risk
- Increases comfort and pleasure
- Essential for anal sex (no natural lubrication)

**Compatible lubricants:**

| Condom Material | Water-Based | Silicone-Based | Oil-Based |
|-----------------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| Latex | Yes | Yes | NO |
| Polyurethane | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Polyisoprene | Yes | Yes | NO |
| Nitrile (internal) | Yes | Yes | Yes |

**Products to avoid with latex:**
- Petroleum jelly (Vaseline)
- Baby oil
- Coconut oil
- Massage oils
- Body lotions

### Troubleshooting Condom Problems

**Breakage:**
- Causes: Expired, wrong lubricant, air bubbles, too small
- If it breaks: Stop, withdraw, discuss emergency contraception and testing

**Slippage:**
- Causes: Lost erection, wrong size, not holding base when withdrawing
- Prevention: Ensure proper fit, withdraw promptly after ejaculation

**Difficulty maintaining erection with condom:**
- Try different brands/materials
- Practice putting on alone
- Incorporate into foreplay
- Consider masturbating with condom to get used to sensation

**Reduced sensation:**
- Try ultra-thin varieties
- Add lubricant inside tip (small amount)
- Try different materials (polyurethane is thinner)

## Complexity Level 4: Advanced Understanding

### Efficacy Data and Research

#### Pregnancy Prevention

- **Perfect use**: 98% effective (2 pregnancies per 100 people per year)
- **Typical use**: 87% effective (13 pregnancies per 100 people per year)

The difference is mainly due to:
- Inconsistent use (not every time)
- Incorrect use (errors in application)

#### STI Prevention

**Meta-analysis findings:**

| STI | Risk Reduction with Consistent Use |
|-----|-----------------------------------|
| HIV | 80-95% |
| Gonorrhea | 60-80% |
| Chlamydia | 60-80% |
| Trichomoniasis | 60-80% |
| Herpes (HSV-2) | ~30% |
| HPV | ~70% |
| Syphilis | 50-70% |

**Why some STIs show lower reduction:**
- Herpes, HPV, and syphilis can transmit through skin contact in areas not covered by condom
- Condoms still provide significant protection

### Dual Protection Strategies

**Condoms + Hormonal Contraception:**
- Provides backup for pregnancy prevention
- Maintains STI protection
- Recommended for maximum efficacy

**Condoms + PrEP:**
- PrEP prevents HIV
- Condoms prevent other STIs
- Combined approach for those at higher HIV risk

### Condom Negotiation Strategies

**Preparing for the conversation:**
- Decide your boundaries beforehand
- Have condoms available
- Practice responses to resistance

**Communication approaches:**

*Direct approach:*
"I always use condoms. It's not negotiable for me."

*Collaborative approach:*
"Let's use condoms - I want us both to feel safe."

*Health-focused approach:*
"I was tested recently and use condoms with all partners. What about you?"

**Responding to common objections:**

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "It doesn't feel as good" | "Let's try different brands/add lube" |
| "I'm clean" | "Many STIs have no symptoms - let's both be safe" |
| "Don't you trust me?" | "It's not about trust - it's about health" |
| "Just this once" | "My health is worth protecting every time" |
| "I'll pull out" | "That doesn't protect against STIs" |

### Special Considerations

**Anal sex:**
- Higher friction increases breakage risk
- Use extra lubrication
- Consider thicker condoms designed for anal sex
- Internal condoms also work for receptive anal sex

**Oral sex:**
- Lower STI risk but not zero
- Use unlubricated condoms or dental dams
- Flavored condoms can make it more pleasant
- Cut external condom lengthwise for use as dam

**Multiple rounds:**
- Use new condom each time
- Even if no ejaculation occurred
