# PrEP for HIV Prevention

> Patient Education: STI Prevention

## Overview

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective medication strategy to prevent HIV infection in people who do not have HIV but are at risk. When taken as prescribed, PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%.

## Complexity Level 1: Basic Understanding

### What Is PrEP?

PrEP stands for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis - medicine taken BEFORE potential HIV exposure to prevent infection.

### How Does It Work?

- You take medication regularly
- The medicine builds up in your body
- If HIV enters your body, the medicine stops it from establishing infection

### Who Should Consider PrEP?

- People whose sexual partner(s) have HIV
- People who don't consistently use condoms
- People who have been diagnosed with an STI recently
- People who share injection drug equipment

### Key Points

- PrEP is very effective when taken correctly
- It only prevents HIV, not other STIs
- You need regular check-ups while on PrEP
- PrEP is available by prescription

## Complexity Level 2: Fundamental Concepts

### Types of PrEP Available

#### Oral PrEP

**Truvada (emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate)**
- Original FDA-approved PrEP (2012)
- One pill daily
- Generic versions available (more affordable)

**Descovy (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide)**
- Approved 2019
- One pill daily
- May have fewer bone and kidney effects
- Not studied for receptive vaginal sex

#### Injectable PrEP

**Apretude (cabotegravir)**
- Approved 2021
- Injection every 2 months (after initial doses)
- Good option for those who have difficulty with daily pills

### How Effective Is PrEP?

| PrEP Type | Effectiveness (with adherence) |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| Daily oral | ~99% for sex |
| On-demand (2-1-1)* | ~86-97% |
| Injectable | ~99% |

*On-demand dosing only studied in cisgender men who have sex with men

### Starting PrEP: The Process

1. **Consultation** - Discuss with healthcare provider
2. **HIV test** - Must be negative to start
3. **Kidney function test** - Ensure kidneys are healthy
4. **Hepatitis B test** - Check status
5. **STI screening** - Baseline testing
6. **Prescription** - Start medication
7. **Follow-up** - Every 3 months

### Daily Routine

- Take one pill at the same time each day
- Can take with or without food
- Set reminders if helpful
- Takes about 7 days to reach full protection for anal sex
- Takes about 21 days for vaginal sex

## Complexity Level 3: Detailed Knowledge

### Detailed Eligibility Criteria

#### Good Candidates for PrEP

**Based on sexual behavior:**
- Sexually active gay or bisexual men
- Transgender individuals with sexual risk factors
- Heterosexuals with HIV-positive partners
- People who don't consistently use condoms
- People with multiple sexual partners
- People with recent STI diagnosis
- People who engage in transactional sex

**Based on injection drug use:**
- People who inject drugs
- People who share needles or injection equipment

#### When PrEP May Not Be Right

- Already HIV-positive (different medications needed)
- Severe kidney disease
- Unable to commit to regular follow-up
- Unwilling to take medication consistently

### Understanding the Medications

#### Truvada Components

**Emtricitabine (FTC)**
- Blocks HIV reverse transcriptase enzyme
- Stops viral replication early in infection cycle

**Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)**
- Also blocks reverse transcriptase
- Achieves high concentrations in rectal and genital tissues

#### Descovy Differences

**Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) instead of TDF:**
- More efficiently enters cells
- Lower blood levels, higher cell levels
- Reduced impact on bone density
- Reduced impact on kidney function
- NOTE: Not studied in cisgender women for vaginal sex

### On-Demand (Event-Driven) PrEP

**2-1-1 Protocol:**
1. Take 2 pills 2-24 hours before sex
2. Take 1 pill 24 hours after first dose
3. Take 1 pill 24 hours after second dose

**Important limitations:**
- Only validated for cisgender MSM (men who have sex with men)
- Not recommended for cisgender women, transgender individuals, or injection drug use
- Requires ability to plan ahead
- Less effective than daily PrEP

### Side Effects and Management

**Common (usually temporary):**
- Nausea (first few weeks)
- Headache
- Fatigue
- Stomach discomfort

**Management strategies:**
- Take with food
- Take at bedtime
- Side effects usually resolve within 1 month

**Rare but serious (Truvada/TDF):**
- Kidney function changes
- Bone density reduction
- Monitored through regular lab work

### Monitoring Schedule

| Time Point | Tests Required |
|------------|---------------|
| Baseline | HIV, kidney function, Hepatitis B, STI screen |
| 1 month | HIV (some providers), tolerability check |
| Every 3 months | HIV, STI screen |
| Every 6-12 months | Kidney function |
| As needed | Pregnancy testing |

│ • Partner services              │
│ • Structural interventions      │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
        ↓
   Reduced HIV Incidence
```

#### Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative

**Goals by 2030:**
- 90% reduction in new HIV infections
- PrEP uptake is critical component
- Focus on geographic hotspots
- Reaching disproportionately affected populations

#### PrEP Coverage Gaps

**Current challenges:**
- Only ~25% of people who could benefit are on PrEP
- Significant racial disparities in PrEP access
- Geographic disparities (urban vs. rural)
- Cost and insurance barriers
- Stigma affecting uptake

### Pharmacokinetics and Tissue Protection

#### Drug Concentration Timelines

**Rectal tissue:**
- Protective levels reached: ~7 days of daily dosing
- Tissue levels remain high: ~7 days after stopping

**Vaginal tissue:**
- Protective levels reached: ~21 days of daily dosing
- More variable concentration levels
- Why on-demand not validated for vaginal exposure

**Blood (for injection-related exposure):**
- Protective levels reached: ~21 days of daily dosing

#### Injectable PrEP Pharmacokinetics

**Cabotegravir (Apretude):**
- Initial phase: Two injections 4 weeks apart
- Maintenance: Every 8 weeks (2 months)
- Long half-life: ~40 days
- Provides consistent protection without daily adherence
- Requires consistent clinic visits

### Resistance Concerns

#### If HIV Acquired on PrEP

**Risk factors for resistance:**
- Starting PrEP during acute/undiagnosed infection
- Poor adherence with ongoing exposure
- Extremely rare with good adherence

**Implications:**
- May limit future treatment options (M184V mutation)
- Reinforces need for regular HIV testing
- Proper baseline testing before starting

#### Population-Level Resistance

**Surveillance data shows:**
- No significant increase in transmitted resistance attributable to PrEP
- Benefits of PrEP far outweigh resistance risks
- Continued monitoring essential

### Health Equity Considerations

#### Racial Disparities

**HIV epidemic disproportionately affects:**
- Black/African American communities
- Hispanic/Latino communities
- Yet PrEP uptake lowest in these groups

**Contributing factors:**
- Healthcare access
