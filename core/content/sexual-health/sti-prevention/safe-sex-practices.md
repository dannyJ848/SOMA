# Safe Sex Practices

> Patient Education: STI Prevention

## Overview

Safe sex practices are behaviors that reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unintended pregnancy. These practices protect both you and your partners while allowing for a healthy, fulfilling sex life.

## Complexity Level 1: Basic Understanding

### What Is Safe Sex?

Safe sex means taking steps to protect yourself and your partners from STIs during sexual activity.

### Key Points

- **Barrier methods** like condoms block germs
- **Communication** with partners about sexual health
- **Testing** to know your status
- **Limiting partners** reduces exposure risk

### Simple Steps

1. Use condoms every time
2. Talk to your partners about testing
3. Get tested regularly
4. Avoid sex when you or a partner has symptoms

## Complexity Level 2: Fundamental Concepts

### Types of Sexual Activity and Risk

| Activity | STI Risk Level | Pregnancy Risk |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Vaginal sex (unprotected) | High | Yes |
| Anal sex (unprotected) | Very High | No |
| Oral sex (unprotected) | Low to Moderate | No |
| Mutual masturbation | Very Low | No |
| Kissing (deep) | Very Low | No |
| Skin-to-skin contact | Low (for some STIs) | No |

### Barrier Methods

**External (Male) Condoms**
- 98% effective when used correctly
- Protect against most STIs
- Use water-based or silicone-based lubricant

**Internal (Female) Condoms**
- 95% effective when used correctly
- Can be inserted up to 8 hours before sex
- Provide more coverage of external genitalia

**Dental Dams**
- Thin latex squares for oral sex
- Reduce transmission of STIs during oral-vaginal or oral-anal contact

### Communication Basics

Questions to discuss with partners:
- When were you last tested?
- What were you tested for?
- Do you have any current infections?
- What protection methods should we use?

## Complexity Level 3: Detailed Knowledge

### Comprehensive Risk Reduction Strategies

#### Primary Prevention

1. **Abstinence** - 100% effective but not practical for most adults
2. **Mutual monogamy** - Both partners tested and exclusively with each other
3. **Consistent barrier use** - Every time, start to finish
4. **Vaccination** - HPV and Hepatitis B vaccines
5. **PrEP** - Pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention

#### Secondary Prevention

1. **Regular testing** - Based on risk factors
2. **Prompt treatment** - If infection occurs
3. **Partner notification** - Inform partners of exposure
4. **Avoiding sex during outbreaks** - For herpes and other visible infections

### Understanding Transmission Routes

**Blood-borne transmission:**
- HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C
- Risk: sharing needles, blood contact with open wounds

**Genital fluid transmission:**
- HIV, Gonorrhea, Chlamydia, Trichomoniasis
- Risk: vaginal, anal, oral sex without barriers

**Skin-to-skin transmission:**
- Herpes, HPV, Syphilis
- Risk: direct contact with infected areas (condoms reduce but don't eliminate)

### Lubricant Selection

| Lubricant Type | Latex Compatible | Notes |
|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Water-based | Yes | Safe with all condoms; may need reapplication |
| Silicone-based | Yes | Longer lasting; not for use with silicone toys |
| Oil-based | NO | Degrades latex; can cause condom failure |

### Alcohol and Substance Considerations

- Impaired judgment increases risk-taking
- May lead to inconsistent protection use
- Strategy: make decisions about protection before substance use
- Consider pre-positioning supplies if planning sexual activity

## Complexity Level 4: Advanced Understanding

### Negotiating Safer Sex

#### Power Dynamics and Communication

**Assertive communication techniques:**
- Use "I" statements: "I feel more comfortable when we use condoms"
- Be direct: "I need us to use protection"
- Set non-negotiable boundaries: "Condoms are required for me to have sex"

**Addressing resistance:**
- Partner claims it "doesn't feel as good": Suggest different condom brands, sizes, or adding lubricant
- Partner claims they're "clean": Explain that many STIs have no symptoms
- Partner pressure: Your boundaries are valid; consider if this relationship is healthy

#### Serosorting and Seropositioning

**Serosorting:** Choosing partners based on HIV status
- Limitations: Only works if status is recent and accurate
- Does not protect against other STIs
- False sense of security if partner has other infections

**Seropositioning:** Strategic positioning based on HIV status
- Insertive partner has lower HIV acquisition risk
- Should not replace condom use
- Only reduces (does not eliminate) risk

### Combined Prevention Approaches

**For maximum protection:**
1. PrEP (for HIV) + condoms (for other STIs)
2. Regular testing (every 3 months for high-risk individuals)
3. HPV and Hepatitis B vaccination
4. Open communication with all partners

**Treatment as Prevention (TasP):**
- People with HIV who maintain undetectable viral load cannot transmit HIV sexually
- Known as U=U (Undetectable = Untransmittable)
- Does not prevent other STIs

### Specific Population Considerations

**Men who have sex with men (MSM):**
- Higher rates of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea
- Recommended: quarterly testing, PrEP consideration
- Hepatitis A vaccination also recommended

**People with multiple partners:**
- More frequent testing recommended
- Consider PrEP for HIV prevention
- Inform all partners of any positive results

**Sex workers:**
- Consistent barrier use is essential
- Regular comprehensive testing
- Access to PrEP and other prevention tools

## Complexity Level 5: Expert/Comprehensive

### Evidence-Based Prevention Efficacy

#### Condom Effectiveness Research

**Meta-analysis findings:**
- Consistent condom use reduces HIV transmission by 80-95%
- Reduces gonorrhea and chlamydia transmission by 60-80%
- Reduces herpes transmission by approximately 30% (due to areas not covered)
- HPV protection approximately 70% (similar limitation)

**Factors affecting effectiveness:**
- Correct and consistent use (most failures are usage errors)
- Condom quality and proper storage
- Adequate lubrication
- Appropriate size selection

#### Biomedical Prevention Integration

**Combination prevention model:**
```
Behavioral + Biomedical + Structural = Optimal Prevention

Behavioral: Condom use, partner reduction, communication
Biomedical: PrEP, TasP, vaccination, testing
Structural: Access to healthcare, destigmatization, education
```

**PrEP efficacy data:**
- Daily oral PrEP: >99% effective when taken as prescribed
- Injectable PrEP (cabotegravir): Similar or superior efficacy
- Reduces anxiety about HIV, potentially improving sexual wellbeing

### Public Health Framework

#### CDC Recommendations for STI Prevention

**Screening recommendations:**
- All adults 13-64: HIV test at least once
- Sexually active women <25: Annual chlamydia/gonorrhea screening
- MSM: Comprehensive STI screening every 3-6 months
- Pregnant individuals: HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B at first prenatal visit

**Vaccination recommendations:**
- HPV: All individuals through age 26 (may extend to 45 with shared decision-making)
- Hepatitis B: All unvaccinated adults at risk
- Hepatitis A: MSM, people who use drugs, people experiencing homelessness

### Harm Reduction Philosophy

Harm reduction acknowledges that:
1. People will engage in sexual activity
2. Abstinence-only approaches have failed to reduce STI rates
3. Meeting people where they are improves outcomes
4. Any risk reduction is valuable, even if not perfect

**Applying harm reduction:**
- If someone won't use condoms for all acts, encourage use for highest-risk activities
- If someone won't get tested monthly, quarterly is better than never
- Any positive change deserves support, not judgment

### Emerging Prevention Technologies

**In development or recently approved:**
- On-demand PrEP regimens (2-1-1 dosing for MSM)
- Multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) combining contraception and STI prevention
- Microbicides and vaginal/rectal gels
- Long-acting injectable PrEP (cabotegravir, lenacapavir)
- Broadly neutralizing antibodies for HIV prevention

## Key Takeaways

1. **No single method is perfect** - combine strategies for best protection
2. **Communication is essential** - talk openly with partners about sexual health
3. **Testing is a form of prevention** - knowing your status protects everyone
4. **Barrier methods work** - when used correctly and consistently
5. **Prevention is evolving** - new options like PrEP offer additional protection
6. **Judgment-free approach** - focus on harm reduction, not shame

## When to Seek Care

- Before starting a new sexual relationship
- If you have symptoms (discharge, sores, pain, itching)
- After unprotected sex with a partner of unknown status
- If a partner tells you they have an STI
- For routine screening based on your risk factors
