# What is Anaphylaxis?

Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen. It requires immediate medical attention.

## Common Symptoms

### Skin Symptoms
- Hives (itchy, raised red patches)
- Itching, flushed skin
- Swelling of the face, lips, or tongue

### Breathing Problems
- Shortness of breath
- Wheezing
- Throat tightness or swelling
- Trouble swallowing

### Other Symptoms
- Nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea
- Stomach pain
- Dizziness or fainting
- Rapid heartbeat
- Feeling of doom or anxiety

## Common Triggers

- Foods (peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs)
- Insect stings (bees, wasps, hornets)
- Medications (antibiotics, aspirin, NSAIDs)
- Latex
- Exercise (in some people)

## What to Do: The Emergency Response

### ACT Fast

**A - Assess the Reaction**
- Is it anaphylaxis? Look for breathing problems, swelling, or multiple symptoms

**C - Call 911**
- Call emergency services immediately
- Don't wait to see if symptoms improve

**T - Treat with Epinephrine**
- Use an epinephrine auto-injector immediately if available
- Don't hesitate - epinephrine saves lives

### After Using Epinephrine

1. **Call 911** immediately (or have someone call)
2. **Go to the emergency department** - even if symptoms improve
3. **Stay with the person** until help arrives
4. **Position properly**: Lie flat with legs elevated (unless breathing is difficult)
5. **Prepare for second dose** if symptoms don't improve after 5-15 minutes

## Prevention

- Know and avoid your triggers
- Always carry epinephrine if prescribed
- Wear medical alert identification
- Tell family, friends, coworkers about your allergies
- Have an emergency action plan
- Learn to use your epinephrine auto-injector properly

## Remember

**Epinephrine is the ONLY medication that treats anaphylaxis.**
- Antihistamines DO NOT treat anaphylaxis
- Inhalers DO NOT treat anaphylaxis
- Use epinephrine FIRST, then other medications if needed

**When in doubt, use epinephrine.** It's better to use it when not needed than to not use it when it is needed.

# Understanding Anaphylaxis

## What Happens During Anaphylaxis?

Anaphylaxis is a systemic allergic reaction that can affect multiple body systems simultaneously. It occurs when the immune system releases large amounts of chemicals that can cause shock.

### Two-Phase Reaction

**Immediate Phase**
- Begins within seconds to minutes
- Can last hours
- Most severe symptoms occur here

**Late Phase (Biphasic Reaction)**
- Returns in 8-12 hours (up to 72 hours) in up to 20% of cases
- Can occur without further exposure
- Why observation is important after initial reaction

## Diagnostic Criteria

Anaphylaxis is HIGHLY likely when ANY ONE of the following is present:

### Criterion 1
Acute onset of illness (minutes to hours) with involvement of:
- Skin/mucosa (hives, itching, swelling) AND
- Respiratory compromise OR
- Reduced blood pressure or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction

### Criterion 2
Two or more of the following occurring rapidly after exposure to likely allergen:
- Skin/mucosal involvement
- Respiratory compromise
- Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms
- Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms

### Criterion 3
Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen

## Common Triggers

### Foods (Most Common in Children)
- Peanuts and tree nuts
- Milk and eggs
- Fish and shellfish
- Sesame seeds
- Soy and wheat

### Medications (Most Common in Adults)
- Antibiotics (penicillin, cephalosporins)
- NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen)
- Neuromuscular blocking agents
- Chemotherapy drugs
- Monoclonal antibodies

### Insect Stings
- Honeybees
- Wasps
- Yellow jackets
- Hornets
- Fire ants

### Other Triggers
- Latex
- Exercise (food-dependent or independent)
- Seminal fluid
- Radiocontrast media

## Recognition and Diagnosis

### Skin Findings (Occurs in 80-90%)
- Urticaria (hives)
- Angioedema (deep tissue swelling)
- Flushing
- Pruritus (itching)

**Important**: Skin symptoms may be ABSENT in up to 20% of cases!

### Respiratory Symptoms (Occurs in 70%)
- Upper airway: throat tightness, stridor
- Lower airway: wheezing, chest tightness, dyspnea
- Rhinorrhea, sneezing

### Cardiovascular Symptoms (Occurs in 45%)
- Hypotension (low blood pressure)
- Tachycardia (fast heart rate)
- Dizziness, syncope (fainting)
- Cardiac arrest

### Gastrointestinal Symptoms (Occurs in 40-45%)
- Nausea, vomiting
- Diarrhea
- Abdominal cramps

### Neurologic Symptoms
- Sense of impending doom
- Anxiety
- Confusion, loss of consciousness

## Epinephrine Auto-Injectors

### Types Available

**EpiPen® and EpiPen Jr®**
- 0.3 mg (adults ≥30 kg)
- 0.15 mg (children 15-30 kg)

**Auvi-Q®**
- 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg
- Voice instructions
- Compact design

**Generic Epinephrine**
- More affordable options
- Same dosing

### Administration Steps

1. **Remove safety cap** (blue)
2. **Place orange tip against outer mid-thigh**
3. **Push firmly** until you hear a click
4. **Hold in place** for 3-10 seconds
5. **Remove and massage** injection site for 10 seconds
6. **Call 911** immediately

### Key Points
- Inject into outer mid-thigh (not buttock or arm)
- Can go through clothing
- Use even if uncertain - epinephrine is safe
- Second dose may be needed in 5-15 minutes if no improvement

## Emergency Management

### Positioning

**Recommended Position**
- Lie flat with legs elevated
- This helps blood flow to heart and brain

**Exceptions**
- If breathing is difficult: sit up
- If pregnant: on left side
- If unconscious: recovery position

**AVOID**
- Standing or walking (can cause sudden death)

### Emergency Department Care

**Observation Period**
- Minimum 4-6 hours (some recommend 8-12 hours)
- Monitoring for biphasic reaction
- Discharge only when stable

**Treatment May Include**
- Oxygen
- IV fluids
- Additional epinephrine
- Antihistamines (adjunct, not replacement)
- Corticosteroids (prevent biphasic?)

## Prevention and Preparedness

### Emergency Action Plan

A written plan should include:
- Specific triggers to avoid
- Early warning signs
- When to use epinephrine
- Step-by-step emergency instructions
- Emergency contact information

### Avoidance Strategies

**For Food Allergy**

# Clinical Management of Anaphylaxis

## Diagnosis and Clinical Criteria

### National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) / FAAN Criteria

Anaphylaxis is highly likely when ANY of the following criteria are met:

**Criterion 1:**
Acute onset (minutes to hours) with involvement of:
- Skin/mucosal tissue (urticaria, itching, flushing, angioedema)
AND AT LEAST ONE OF:
- Respiratory compromise (dyspnea, wheeze, stridor, hypoxia)
- Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (syncope, hypotonia)

**Criterion 2:**
Two or more of the following occurring rapidly after exposure to likely allergen:
- Skin/mucosal involvement
- Respiratory compromise
- Reduced blood pressure or symptoms of end-organ dysfunction
- Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (cramping, vomiting)

**Criterion 3:**
Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen:
- Infants/children: low systolic BP (age-specific) or >30% decrease
- Adults: systolic BP <90 mmHg or >30% decrease from baseline

### Diagnostic Challenges

**Atypical Presentations**
- No skin symptoms (10-20% of cases)
- Isolated cardiovascular collapse
- Isolated respiratory symptoms
- Gastrointestinal dominant presentation

**Misdiagnosis**
- Asthma exacerbation
- Vasovagal syncope
- Panic attack
- Cardiac arrhythmia
- Hereditary angioedema

## Pathophysiology

### Immunologic Mechanisms

**IgE-Mediated (Most Common)**
- Previous sensitization to allergen
- Allergen cross-links IgE on mast cells/basophils
- Immediate release of mediators
- Typical for foods, medications, stings

**Non-IgE Mediated**
- Direct mast cell activation
- Complement activation
- Examples: Radiocontrast, NSAIDs, exercise

### Mediators Released

**Pre-formed Mediators**
- Histamine
- Tryptase
- Chymase
- Heparin

**Newly Synthesized Mediators**
- Leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, LTE4)
- Prostaglandins (PGD2)
- Platelet-activating factor (PAF)
- Cytokines (TNF-α, IL-4, IL-13, IL-33)

**PAF as Key Mediator**
- Correlates with anaphylaxis severity
- Levels correlate with shock severity
- Inactivated by PAF-acetylhydrolase
- Genetic deficiency in PAF-acetylhydrolase increases risk

## Treatment: Emergency Response

### Epinephrine (First-Line Therapy)

**Why Epinephrine is Essential**
- Alpha-1 effects: ↑vasoconstriction, ↑blood pressure, ↓edema
- Beta-1 effects: ↑heart rate, ↑contractility
- Beta-2 effects: bronchodilation, ↓mediator release
- NO medication replaces epinephrine

**Dosing**
- Adults: 0.3-0.5 mg IM (0.3-0.5 mL of 1:1000)
- Children: 0.01 mg/kg IM (max 0.3 mg)
- Infants: 0.01 mg/kg IM
- Repeat every 5-15 minutes if needed

**Route: Intramuscular (IM)**
- Vastus lateralis (mid-outer thigh)
- Auto-injector preferred
- IM faster absorption than subcutaneous
- Avoid subcutaneous injection

**Contraindications**
- NONE in true anaphylaxis
- Benefits outweigh risks in all patients

### Adjunctive Therapies

**Antihistamines**

*H1 Antagonists*
- Diphenhydramine 25-50 mg IV/IM/PO
- Cetirizine 10 mg PO/IV
- Do NOT delay epinephrine for antihistamines
- Adjunctive only - do NOT treat upper airway obstruction or shock

*H2 Antagonists*
- Ranitidine 50 mg IV (or famotidine 20 mg IV)
- May add to H1 blocker
- Adjunctive only

**Corticosteroids**
- Methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg IV (max 125 mg)
- May prevent biphasic reaction (controversial)
- Onset too slow for acute treatment
- Not a substitute for epinephrine

**Bronchodilators**
- Albuterol for persistent wheezing
- Adjunct to epinephrine, not replacement
- Inhaled beta-agonists

**IV Fluids**
- For hypotension or shock
- Crystalloid bolus (10-20 mL/kg)
- May require large volumes (vascular leak)

**Vasopressors**
- For refractory shock despite epinephrine
- Norepinephrine, vasopressin
- ICU monitoring required

### Special Circumstances

**Patients on Beta-Blockers**
- May be resistant to epinephrine
- Consider glucagon 1-5 mg IV
- Higher epinephrine doses may be needed

**Pregnant Patients**
- Hypotension detrimental to fetus
- Left lateral decubitus position
- Standard epinephrine dosing
- Emergency C-section if needed for cardiac arrest

**Patients Taking ACE Inhibitors**
- May have more severe reactions
- Difficulty generating angiotensin II (compensatory)
- Consider stopping ACE inhibitors if recurrent anaphylaxis

## Post-Anaphylaxis Management

### Observation Period

**Why Observe?**
- Biphasic reactions: 1-20% of cases
- Typically occurs 8-12 hours post-reaction
- Range: 1-72 hours

**Duration**
- Minimum 4-6 hours (some recommend longer)
- Extended observation for:
  - Severe initial reaction
  - Asthma
  - Delayed presentation to care
  - Inadequate response to initial epinephrine

### Discharge Planning

**Prescribe Two Auto-Injectors**
- Second dose may be needed
- Keep one at home, one at school/work

**Education**
- Demonstrate proper technique
- When to use (early recognition)
- Return precautions

**Follow-up**
- Allergy referral
- Identify trigger
- Consider testing
- Update action plan

## Biphasic Anaphylaxis

### Definition
- Recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution
- Without re-exposure to trigger
- Can be same or different severity

### Risk Factors
- Severe initial reaction
- Delayed epinephrine administration
- History of asthma
- Unknown trigger

### Management
- Observation key
- Treat with epinephrine
- Consider steroid administration (though evidence limited)

# Advanced Anaphylaxis Management

## Special Populations and Challenges

### Pediatric Considerations

**Age-Specific Presentation**
- Infants may present with: apnea, sudden lethargy, pallor
- Young children: behavior changes, clinging
- Adolescents: risk-taking, non-adherence

**Dosing Considerations**
- Weight-based dosing for epinephrine
- Auto-injector selection based on weight
- Underdosing common with auto-injectors in some children

### Geriatric Patients

**Atypical Presentations**
- May have fewer skin symptoms
- Cardiovascular symptoms dominate
- Confusion, syncope may be primary presentation

**Comorbidities**
- Cardiovascular disease
- Anticoagulation (intramuscular hematomas)
- Polypharmacy

**Medication Interactions**
- Beta-blockers: relative epinephrine resistance
- ACE inhibitors: more severe reactions
- Anticoagulants: route considerations

### Pregnant Patients

**Fetal Considerations**
- Uterine blood flow depends on maternal perfusion
- Hypotension = fetal hypoxia
- Fetal heart rate monitoring

**Management**
- Left lateral decubitus positioning
- Standard epinephrine dosing
- IV fluids more liberal
- Emergency C-section for cardiac arrest

### Patients with Cardiovascular Disease

**Risks**
- Epinephrine increases myocardial O2 demand
- May precipitate ischemia or arrhythmias
- Underlying CAD present in many anaphylaxis deaths

**Management**
- Still need epinephrine (benefits > risks)
- Consider cardiology consultation
- ECG monitoring
- Lower threshold for ICU admission

### Mast Cell Disorders

**Mastocytosis and MCAS**
- Lower threshold for degranulation
- More frequent, more severe reactions
- May not have typical triggers

**Management Differences**
- Higher basal tryptase levels
- May require prophylactic medications
- Consider baseline tryptase
- Genetic testing for hereditary alpha-tryptasemia

## Refractory Anaphylaxis

### Definition
- Persistent symptoms despite 2+ doses of IM epinephrine
- Occurs in approximately 10-25% of cases

### Risk Factors
- Delayed epinephrine administration
- Beta-blocker use
- Severe initial presentation
- Older age
- Cardiovascular disease

### Management

**IV Epinephrine Infusion**
- Start if persistent shock after IM doses
- Titrate to effect
- ICU monitoring essential
- Prepare for arrhythmias

**Dosing**
- Initial: 1 mcg/min
- Titrate by 0.5-1 mcg/min
- Range: 0.05-2 mcg/min
- Prepare: 1 mg in 250 mL D5W (4 mcg/mL)

**Vasopressors**
- Norepinephrine for persistent hypotension
- Vasopressin consideration
- Methylene blue for distributive shock (controversial)

**Other Therapies**
- Methylene blue (methylene blue 1-2 mg/kg IV)
- Consider in distributive shock refractory to epinephrine
- Inhibits guanylate cyclase and nitric oxide

## Differential Diagnosis Considerations

### Anaphylaxis Mimics

**Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)**
- No urticaria
- No pruritus
- Abdominal symptoms common
- Family history
- Normal tryptase

**Vasovagal Syncope**
- Pale, clammy (not flushed)
- Bradycardia (not tachycardia)
- No respiratory symptoms
- Resolves with supine position

**Panic Attack**
- Tingling around mouth (from hyperventilation)
- Carpal spasm may occur
- Normal blood pressure
- No hypoxia

**Asthma Exacerbation**
- No hypotension
- No GI symptoms
- No skin involvement typically
- Doesn't improve with epinephrine as dramatically

**Scombroid Poisoning**
- Histamine-rich fish
- Mimics allergic reaction
- Multiple people affected
- Responds to antihistamines

### Biomarkers

**Serum Tryptase**
- Peaks 1-3 hours after reaction
- Remains elevated 6+ hours
- Baseline vs. acute comparison
- >2 + 1.2 × baseline suggests mast cell activation
- Normal doesn't exclude anaphylaxis

**Histamine**
- Peaks immediately, falls rapidly
- Not clinically useful
- Short half-life

**Chymase**
- Alternative to tryptase
- Less widely available

**Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase**
- Low levels associated with severe anaphylaxis
- Research use currently

## Diagnosis and Follow-up

### Trigger Identification

**Detailed History**
- Timeline of events
- All exposures (food, medications, stings)
- Activity level
- Recent infections
- Menstrual cycle

**Testing Considerations**

*Timing*

- IgE testing: can be done earlier
- False negatives if tested too early

*Foods*
- Specific IgE testing
- Skin prick testing
- Component testing when appropriate
- Oral food challenges (when safe)

*Venom*
- Skin testing and/or specific IgE
- Testing and serum tryptase level
- Consider baseline tryptase

*Medications*

# Expert-Level Perspectives on Anaphylaxis

## Mechanisms in Depth

### Molecular Pathways

**Immediate Phase (0-2 hours)**
- IgE cross-linking on mast cells and basophils
- FcεRI receptor activation
- Lyn, Syk kinase activation
- Calcium influx
- Degranulation

**Late Phase and Biphasic Reactions**
- Leukotriene, prostaglandin production
- Cytokine synthesis (TNF-α, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-33)
- Cellular recruitment (eosinophils, neutrophils, Th2 cells)
- Prolonged mediator production

**Platelet-Activating Factor (PAF)**
- Critical mediator of severity
- Produced by mast cells, basophils, platelets
- Causes vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction
- PAF-acetylhydrolase normally degrades PAF
- Severe anaphylaxis associated with:
  - High PAF levels
  - Low PAF-acetylhydrolase activity
  - Genetic variants in PAF-acetylhydrolase

### Genetic Susceptibility

**PAF-Acetylhydrolase Gene**
- PLA2G7 polymorphisms
- Reduced enzyme activity
- Associated with severe anaphylaxis

**Tryptase Gene**
- TPSAB1 duplications (hereditary alpha-tryptasemia)
- Increased basal tryptase
- More severe reactions

**HLA Associations**
- Specific alleles linked to drug anaphylaxis
- HLA-B*57:01 with abacavir
- HLA-B*15:02 with carbamazepine

**Mast Cell Regulatory Genes**
- KIT mutations (systemic mastocytosis)
- TPSAB1, IL31, IL33 variants
- Genes influencing mediator release

## Clinical Controversies

### Biphasic Reactions

**True Incidence**
- Reported range: 1-20%
- Variable definitions across studies
- May be underrecognized

**Risk Factors**
- Severe initial reaction
- Delayed epinephrine administration
- History of asthma
- Laryngeal edema
- Delayed presentation to care

**Steroid Prophylaxis**
- Common practice to give steroids
- No evidence it prevents biphasic reactions
- Potential for side effects
- Reconsider routine use

**Optimal Observation Duration**
- 4 hours vs. 6-8 hours vs. 24 hours
- Resource vs. risk balance
- Individualize based on:
  - Severity of initial reaction
  - Access to emergency care
  - Patient factors

### Epinephrine Administration

**IM vs. IV Route**
- IM: Standard, safe, recommended
- IV: Reserved for monitored, refractory cases
- No role for subcutaneous (slow absorption)

**Auto-Injector Needle Length**
- Pediatric concerns: needle too long?
- IM absorption vs. subcutaneous
- Individualized based on body habitus

**Weight-Based Dosing**
- Auto-injectors: 0.15 mg vs. 0.3 mg vs. 0.5 mg
- Optimal weight cutoffs debated
- Some children between doses (underdosing)
- Some adults may need >0.3 mg

**High-Concentration Epinephrine**
- 1:1000 vs. 1:10,000 for IM
- Safety concerns with IV concentration

### Second Dose

**Incidence of Second Dose Need**
- ~10-35% require second dose
- Higher for:
  - Delayed first dose
  - Severe reactions
  - Beta-blocker use

**Carrying Two Devices**
- Standard recommendation
- Access and cost issues
- Evidence behind the practice

## Diagnostic Controversies

### Biomarker Use

**Tryptase Interpretation**
- Not always elevated in anaphylaxis
- Elevated in other conditions (mastocytosis, acute myeloid leukemia)
- Timing critical
- Baseline vs. acute: what baseline?
  - After reaction resolved?
  - Months later?
  - Some conditions cause persistent elevation

**Diagnostic Cutoffs**
- Absolute value vs. change from baseline
- Time of specimen collection
- Tissue-specific tryptase release

### Skin Testing Timing

**How Long to Wait?**
- Traditional: 4-6 weeks
- Early testing: possible false negatives
- IgE levels fall over time
- Pragmatic vs. ideal

### Diagnostic Criteria

**Are Current Criteria Optimal?**
- Some severe cases may not meet criteria
- Atypical presentations
- Under-recognition in certain populations
- Need for biomarkers

## Special Situations

### Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis

**Food-Dependent EIA**
- Most common form
- Wheat/omega-5 gliadin most common
- Exercise within 2-4 hours after food
- Specific IgE often present

**Food-Independent EIA**
- NSAIDs as co-factors common
- Alcohol as co-factor
- Temperature extremes

**Management**
- Avoid food for 4+ hours pre-exercise
- Avoid triggers
- Always carry epinephrine
- Exercise with partner

### Idiopathic Anaphylaxis

**Definition**
- No identifiable trigger despite evaluation
- Diagnosis of exclusion
- Subclassified by frequency (infrequent, frequent)

**Evaluation**
- Comprehensive allergy testing
- Consider unusual triggers
- Rule out mastocytosis (serum tryptase)
- Consider psychiatric disease (factitious)

**Management**
- Same acute treatment
- Consider prophylaxis for frequent episodes:
  - Antihistamines
  - Montelukast
  - Omalizumab (case reports)
  - Corticosteroids (last resort)

### Mast Cell Activation Syndromes (MCAS)

**Diagnostic Criteria**
- Recurrent anaphylaxis-like symptoms
- Increase in serum tryptase during episode
- Response to antimediator therapy
- Exclusion of other diagnoses

**Overlap with Anaphylaxis**
- Similar presentations
- May have triggers
- Different underlying pathophysiology
- Different management approaches

## Research Frontiers

### Novel Therapeutics

**Anti-IgE (Omalizumab)**
- Case reports for:
  - Frequent idiopathic anaphylaxis
  - Mastocytosis-related anaphylaxis
  - Refractory cases
