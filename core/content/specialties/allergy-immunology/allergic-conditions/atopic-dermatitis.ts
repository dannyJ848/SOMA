# What is Atopic Dermatitis?

Atopic dermatitis, commonly called eczema, is a chronic skin condition that causes dry, itchy, and inflamed skin. It is common in children but can occur at any age.

## Common Symptoms

- Dry, scaly skin
- Intense itching (may be worse at night)
- Red to brownish-gray patches
- Small, raised bumps that may leak fluid
- Thickened, cracked, or scaly skin
- Raw, sensitive skin from scratching

## Common Areas Affected

**Babies and Young Children**
- Scalp and face (especially cheeks)
- Arms and legs
- Body creases (elbows, knees)

**Older Children and Adults**
- Hands and feet
- Inside elbows and behind knees
- Ankles, wrists, neck, eyelids
- Skin around the mouth and nose

## Triggers

- Dry skin
- Scratching
- Irritants (soaps, detergents, fragrances)
- Allergens (pollen, pet dander, dust mites)
- Heat and sweating
- Stress
- Certain fabrics (wool)

## Daily Skin Care

**Moisturizing**
- Apply moisturizer at least twice daily
- Use fragrance-free products
- Apply within 3 minutes after bathing
- Use thick creams or ointments (lotions are less effective)

**Bathing**
- Use lukewarm water (not hot)
- Limit bath time to 5-10 minutes
- Use gentle, fragrance-free cleansers
- Pat skin dry, don't rub

**Managing Itch**
- Keep nails short
- Use cool compresses
- Wear soft, breathable clothing (cotton)
- Avoid scratching as much as possible

## When to See a Doctor

- Skin discomfort affects sleep or daily activities
- Signs of infection (honey-colored crusts, blisters, pus)
- Home treatments aren't working
- Fever develops

# Understanding Atopic Dermatitis

## What Causes Atopic Dermatitis?

### Skin Barrier Problems
- Genetic factors affect skin barrier function
- Filaggrin gene mutations
- Difficulty retaining moisture
- Easier entry for allergens and bacteria

### Immune System Factors
- Overactive immune response
- Inflammation in the skin
- Increased sensitivity to irritants

### Environmental Factors
- Allergens
- Irritants
- Climate
- Stress

## The Atopic March

Atopic dermatitis is often the first step in the "atopic march" - the progression of allergic diseases:
1. Atopic dermatitis (often starts in infancy)
2. Food allergies
3. Allergic rhinitis (hay fever)
4. Asthma

Not everyone with eczema develops all conditions, but the risk is increased.

## Types of Atopic Dermatitis

### Infantile AD (0-2 years)
- Red, weepy patches on face, scalp, extremities
- May resolve by age 2-3
- 50% persist into childhood

### Childhood AD (2-12 years)
- Patches in skin folds (elbows, knees)
- Thickened, excoriated skin
- Neck, wrists, ankles often involved

### Adolescent/Adult AD
- Patches on face, neck, hands
- Often more localized
- Can be more severe

## Triggers to Avoid

**Common Irritants**
- Harsh soaps and detergents
- Fragrances and perfumes
- Wool and synthetic fabrics
- Hot water
- Chlorine in pools

**Environmental Allergens**
- Dust mites
- Pet dander
- Pollen
- Mold

**Other Triggers**
- Stress and anxiety
- Heat and sweating
- Dry weather
- Hormonal changes

## Treatment Basics

### Moisturizers (Emollients)

**Choosing the Right Product**
- Ointments: Most moisturizing, greasy
- Creams: Good balance
- Lotions: Least moisturizing, may contain more preservatives
- Fragrance-free, dye-free products

**Application**
- Apply at least twice daily
- More often if skin is very dry
- Use generous amounts
- Apply in direction of hair growth

### Topical Steroids

**Purpose**
- Reduce inflammation
- Relieve itching
- Clear flare-ups

**Common Types**
- Low potency: Hydrocortisone (available over-the-counter)
- Medium potency: Triamcinolone, Mometasone
- High potency: Clobetasol (short-term use only)

**General Rules**
- Use only on affected areas
- Apply to damp skin after moisturizing
- Use lowest effective strength
- Don't use on face unless prescribed

### Other Medications

**Antihistamines**
- Help with itching, especially at night
- Diphenhydramine, cetirizine, loratadine
- May cause drowsiness

**Antibiotics**
- Only for bacterial infections
- Signs: honey-colored crusting, pus, warmth

## Infection Prevention

### Bacterial Infections
- Staphylococcus aureus commonly found on AD skin
- Bleach baths can reduce bacteria
- Keep fingernails clean and short

### Viral Infections
- Eczema herpeticum (herpes infection)
- Molluscum contagiosum
- Avoid contact with active cold sores

## Daily Management Tips

1. **Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize**
2. **Identify and avoid triggers**
3. **Use gentle skin care products**
4. **Manage stress**
5. **Keep cool and dry**
6. **Wear soft, breathable clothing**
7. **Follow treatment plan consistently**
