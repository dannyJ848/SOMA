# What is Primary Immunodeficiency?

Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDD) are disorders where part of the body's immune system is missing or doesn't function properly. These are usually inherited (genetic) conditions present from birth, though symptoms may not appear until later in life.

## Common Signs and Symptoms

### Frequent Infections
- Needing antibiotics more than 2 times per year
- Infections that don't go away easily
- Infections that keep coming back
- Needing IV antibiotics for infections

### Unusual Infections
- Infections with organisms that don't usually make people sick
- Fungal infections
- Persistent thrush or fungal skin infections

### Other Common Problems
- Poor growth or failure to thrive (in children)
- Chronic diarrhea
- Absent tonsils or lymph nodes
- Skin rashes
- Autoimmune problems
- Family history of early deaths

## Most Common Types

### Antibody Deficiencies
- The body doesn't make enough antibodies
- Most common type of PIDD
- Examples: Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID), X-linked Agammaglobulinemia

### Combined Immunodeficiencies
- Both T-cells and B-cells affected
- More severe
- Example: Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)

### Phagocytic Cell Deficiencies
- Problems with white blood cells that fight bacteria
- Example: Chronic Granulomatous Disease

## When to See a Specialist

Consider seeing an immunologist if you or your child has:
- Eight or more ear infections in one year
- Two or more serious sinus infections in one year
- Two or more pneumonias in one year
- Need IV antibiotics to clear infections
- Infections with unusual organisms
- Family history of immunodeficiency

## Basic Management

### Infection Prevention
- Good hand hygiene
- Staying up to date on vaccines (with some exceptions)
- Avoiding sick people when possible
- Prompt treatment of infections

### Treatment Options
- Antibiotic prophylaxis (preventive antibiotics)
- Immunoglobulin replacement (IVIG or SCIG)
- Medications to boost immune function
- Bone marrow transplant for severe cases

# Understanding Primary Immunodeficiency

## How the Immune System Works

### Normal Immune System Components

**White Blood Cells**
- Neutrophils: First responders, eat bacteria
- Lymphocytes: T-cells and B-cells
  - B-cells: Make antibodies
  - T-cells: Help B-cells and kill infected cells
- NK cells: Natural killer cells

**Antibodies**
- Proteins that recognize germs
- Help mark germs for destruction
- Different types (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE, IgD)

**Complement System**
- Group of proteins that help antibodies
- Help destroy bacteria

## Classification of Primary Immunodeficiencies

### Antibody Deficiencies (Most Common)

**X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA)**
- Genetic defect in B-cell development
- Mostly affects males
- Very low antibody levels
- Recurrent bacterial infections

**Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID)**
- Low antibody levels
- Can develop at any age
- Both men and women affected
- Recurrent sinopulmonary infections

**Selective IgA Deficiency**
- Most common PIDD
- Low IgA levels
- Some have no symptoms
- Others have recurrent infections

**Hyper IgM Syndrome**
- Normal/high IgM, low other antibodies
- Recurrent infections
- Neutropenia common

### Combined Immunodeficiencies

**Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID)**
- Life-threatening in infancy
- "Bubble boy disease"
- Defect in both T-cells and B-cells
- Requires bone marrow transplant

**Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome**
- Low platelets, eczema, infections
- X-linked inheritance
- T-cell and B-cell dysfunction

### Phagocytic Cell Disorders

**Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD)**
- Neutrophils can't kill certain bacteria/fungi
- Granulomas form
- Recurrent infections with catalase-positive organisms

**Leukocyte Adhesion Deficiency**
- White cells can't get to infection sites
- Delayed umbilical cord separation
- Poor wound healing

### Complement Deficiencies

**C2 Deficiency**
- Most common complement deficiency
- Increased risk of infections
- Autoimmune disease risk

**C3 Deficiency**
- Severe recurrent infections
- Similar to antibody deficiency

## Diagnosis

### Warning Signs (10 Warning Signs)

1. Four or more new ear infections within one year
2. Two or more serious sinus infections within one year
3. Two or more months on antibiotics with little effect
4. Two or more pneumonias within one year
5. Failure of an infant to gain weight or grow normally
6. Recurrent, deep skin or organ abscesses
7. Persistent thrush in mouth or fungal infection on skin
8. Need for intravenous antibiotics to clear infections
9. Two or more deep-seated infections including septicemia
10. A family history of primary immunodeficiency
