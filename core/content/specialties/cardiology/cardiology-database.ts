    description: 'Irregular and often rapid heart rhythm originating from chaotic electrical activity in the atria, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia.',
    pathophysiology: 'Multiple re-entrant wavelets or rapidly firing ectopic foci (often from pulmonary vein ostia) cause disorganized atrial depolarization at 350-600/min. The AV node conducts irregularly, producing an irregularly irregular ventricular response. Loss of atrial contraction reduces cardiac output by 15-25% and promotes blood stasis, increasing thromboembolic risk.',

    complications: ['Ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolism', 'Heart failure (tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy)', 'Hemodynamic instability', 'Reduced quality of life', 'Increased mortality'],
    patientExplanation: 'Atrial fibrillation means the upper chambers of your heart are quivering instead of beating in a steady rhythm. This makes your heartbeat feel fast and irregular. The biggest danger is that blood can pool in the heart and form clots, which could travel to the brain and cause a stroke. That is why many people with AFib take blood thinners. Medicines can also slow or steady the heart rate.',

    description: 'Organized macro-reentrant atrial tachycardia, typically involving a circuit around the tricuspid valve annulus, with characteristic sawtooth flutter waves on ECG.',
    pathophysiology: 'A single macro-reentrant circuit, most commonly counterclockwise around the tricuspid annulus through the cavotricuspid isthmus (typical flutter). Atrial rate is ~300 bpm, usually conducted 2:1 through the AV node producing a ventricular rate of ~150 bpm. Less commonly, 3:1 or 4:1 block occurs.',

    complications: ['Stroke and thromboembolism (similar risk to AFib)', 'Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy', 'Degeneration into atrial fibrillation', '1:1 conduction with hemodynamic collapse (especially with class IC drugs without AV nodal blockade)'],
    patientExplanation: 'Atrial flutter is similar to atrial fibrillation but more organized. The upper chambers of the heart beat very rapidly in a regular loop pattern, usually around 300 times per minute, while the lower chambers beat at about 150 times per minute. It can cause a fast heartbeat, shortness of breath, and also raises stroke risk. A procedure called ablation can often cure it permanently.',

    description: 'A group of arrhythmias originating above the ventricles that cause episodes of rapid regular heart rate, most commonly AVNRT or AVRT.',
    pathophysiology: 'Most SVTs involve re-entrant circuits. In AVNRT (~60% of SVTs), dual AV nodal pathways (fast and slow) form the circuit. In AVRT (~30%), an accessory pathway (e.g., bundle of Kent in WPW) creates a macro-reentrant loop. Atrial tachycardia (~10%) involves enhanced automaticity or micro-reentry within the atria. Heart rates typically 150-250 bpm.',

    complications: ['Hemodynamic compromise if prolonged', 'Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy (if incessant)', 'Rarely syncope', 'Anxiety and reduced quality of life'],
    patientExplanation: 'SVT causes episodes where your heart suddenly beats very fast, usually between 150 and 250 beats per minute. It happens because electrical signals in the heart get caught in a short circuit loop above the lower chambers. Episodes can start and stop suddenly. Simple tricks like bearing down or putting your face in cold water can sometimes stop an episode. Medicine or a procedure called ablation can prevent them from coming back.',

    pathophysiology: 'Arises from abnormal automaticity, triggered activity, or re-entry within the ventricular myocardium. Most commonly associated with scar-related re-entry in structural heart disease (prior MI, cardiomyopathy). Monomorphic VT has a single QRS morphology (stable circuit).

    complications: ['Sudden cardiac death', 'Degeneration to ventricular fibrillation', 'Cardiogenic shock', 'End-organ damage from hypoperfusion', 'ICD shocks affecting quality of life'],
    patientExplanation: 'Ventricular tachycardia is a dangerously fast heartbeat that starts in the lower pumping chambers of the heart. Because the heart is beating so fast and from an abnormal place, it may not pump blood effectively. This can cause dizziness, fainting, or even be life-threatening if it does not stop on its own. Treatment may include medicines, an electric shock to reset the heart, or a small implanted device (defibrillator) that can automatically shock the heart back to normal.',

    complications: ['Death (without immediate treatment)', 'Anoxic brain injury', 'Post-cardiac arrest syndrome', 'Recurrent arrest', 'Multi-organ failure'],
    patientExplanation: 'Ventricular fibrillation is the most dangerous heart rhythm. The lower chambers of the heart quiver chaotically instead of pumping, so no blood flows to the body or brain. A person will collapse and stop breathing within seconds. The only effective treatment is an immediate electric shock (defibrillation) combined with CPR. This is why public defibrillators (AEDs) are placed in airports, gyms, and other public spaces.',

    pathophysiology: 'An accessory pathway of myocardial tissue connects the atria and ventricles, bypassing the AV node delay. During sinus rhythm, impulses conduct through both the AV node and accessory pathway, causing a short PR interval and delta wave (pre-excitation). The pathway enables macro-reentrant tachycardias (orthodromic AVRT most common). If AFib develops, rapid conduction through the accessory pathway can cause VFib.',

    complications: ['Sudden cardiac death (rare, ~0.1-0.3%/year)', 'Ventricular fibrillation from rapid accessory pathway conduction during AFib', 'Recurrent SVT episodes', 'Hemodynamic compromise during tachycardia'],
    patientExplanation: 'WPW means you were born with an extra electrical wire between the upper and lower chambers of your heart. This extra wire can cause episodes of very fast heartbeat by creating a short circuit. Most of the time it is not dangerous, but in rare cases it can cause a very serious fast rhythm. A procedure called ablation can disconnect the extra wire and usually cures the condition permanently.',

    pathophysiology: 'Prolonged repolarization from dysfunction of potassium (LQT1-KCNQ1, LQT2-KCNH2) or sodium (LQT3-SCN5A) channels creates transmural dispersion of repolarization. This enables early afterdepolarizations that can trigger torsades de pointes (polymorphic VT).

    complications: ['Torsades de pointes', 'Ventricular fibrillation', 'Sudden cardiac death', 'Inappropriate ICD shocks', 'Psychosocial impact of activity restrictions'],
    patientExplanation: 'Long QT syndrome means the electrical system in your heart takes too long to reset between beats. This can sometimes trigger a dangerously fast heart rhythm that causes fainting or, rarely, sudden cardiac arrest. It can be inherited or caused by certain medicines. Treatment usually includes a beta-blocker medicine and avoiding specific drugs. Some people may need a small implanted device that can shock the heart if a dangerous rhythm occurs.',

    description: 'Open-heart surgery creating bypass grafts around blocked coronary arteries using arterial (LIMA, RIMA, radial) or venous (saphenous vein) conduits to restore myocardial blood flow.',
    pathophysiology: 'Bypass grafts are anastomosed distal to coronary stenoses, providing new blood supply routes. Left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to LAD is the gold standard graft (90%+ patency at 10 years). Saphenous vein grafts (SVG) have lower long-term patency (~50% at 10 years). CABG offers survival benefit over PCI in left main disease, 3-vessel disease (especially with diabetes or reduced EF), and complex coronary anatomy (high SYNTAX score). Surgery typically performed on cardiopulmonary bypass with cardioplegia (arrested heart), though off-pump CABG is an option.',
    clinicalFeatures: ['Preoperative: severe angina or ACS, complex coronary anatomy', 'Postoperative: sternotomy wound care, gradual return of activity', 'Recovery: 6-12 weeks full recovery', 'Long-term: symptom relief in most patients'],
    diagnostics: ['Pre-CABG: coronary angiography with SYNTAX score for complexity assessment', 'Heart team decision (interventional cardiology + cardiac surgery)', 'Preoperative assessment: echocardiography (EF, valvular disease), carotid duplex, PFTs, renal function', 'Risk scoring: STS score for operative mortality prediction', 'Post-CABG: ECG monitoring, troponin, echocardiography'],
    treatment: ['Procedure: median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass (most), graft anastomosis', 'LIMA to LAD (should be performed in all CABG)', 'Additional arterial grafts (RIMA, radial artery) increasingly used for better long-term outcomes', 'SVG for remaining targets', 'Post-op: ICU monitoring, ventilator weaning, chest tube management', 'Medications: aspirin indefinitely, statin, beta-blocker, ACEi/ARB', 'Cardiac rehabilitation (supervised exercise program)', 'Sternal precautions for 6-8 weeks'],
    complications: ['Perioperative mortality (1-3% for elective, higher for emergent)', 'Stroke (1-2%)', 'Mediastinitis / sternal wound infection', 'Atrial fibrillation (20-40% postop)', 'Graft failure (early or late)', 'Postpericardiotomy syndrome', 'Renal failure', 'Cognitive decline (pump head)', 'Bleeding requiring reoperation', 'Pneumonia and atelectasis'],
    patientExplanation: 'CABG (coronary artery bypass graft, pronounced "cabbage") is open-heart surgery to bypass blocked heart arteries. The surgeon takes a blood vessel from your chest wall, arm, or leg and attaches it to the heart artery past the blockage, creating a detour for blood flow. It is the best option when multiple arteries are severely blocked. Recovery takes 6-12 weeks, during which you participate in cardiac rehabilitation. Most people experience significant improvement in their symptoms and quality of life.',

    description: 'Surgical or transcatheter replacement of a diseased heart valve with a mechanical or bioprosthetic valve to restore normal hemodynamics.',
    pathophysiology: 'Severely stenotic or regurgitant valves that cannot be repaired are replaced. Mechanical valves (bileaflet, tilting disc) are durable but require lifelong anticoagulation (INR 2.5-3.5 aortic, 2.5-3.5 mitral) due to thrombogenicity. Bioprosthetic valves (porcine, bovine pericardial) do not require long-term anticoagulation but have limited durability (10-20 years, faster degeneration in younger patients). TAVR/TAVI uses catheter-delivered bioprosthesis for aortic position. Choice depends on age, bleeding risk, anticoagulation compliance, and patient preference.',
    clinicalFeatures: ['Preoperative: symptoms of severe valvular disease (dyspnea, angina, syncope, heart failure)', 'Postoperative: prosthetic valve clicks (mechanical), improved hemodynamics', 'Annual follow-up with echocardiography', 'Anticoagulation management (mechanical valves)'],

    patientExplanation: 'Heart valve replacement surgery removes a damaged valve and puts in a new one. There are two main types: mechanical valves (made of metal, last a lifetime but require blood thinner medication forever) and tissue valves (made from animal tissue, do not need long-term blood thinners but wear out after 10-20 years). For aortic valves, a newer option called TAVR can replace the valve through a catheter without open-heart surgery. Your heart team will help you choose the best option based on your age, health, and lifestyle.',

    description: 'Noninvasive assessment of myocardial ischemia and functional capacity by monitoring cardiovascular response to exercise or pharmacologic stress.',
    pathophysiology: 'Exercise increases myocardial oxygen demand via increased heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure (rate-pressure product). In the presence of significant coronary stenosis (>70%), blood flow cannot augment sufficiently, causing ischemia detectable by ECG changes, wall motion abnormalities, or perfusion defects. Pharmacologic alternatives: dobutamine (inotropic/chronotropic stress) or vasodilators (adenosine, regadenoson, dipyridamole) create differential flow between stenosed and normal coronary beds.',

    patientExplanation: 'A cardiac stress test checks how your heart works when it is working hard. Usually you walk on a treadmill while your heart is monitored. If you cannot exercise, a medication can stress the heart instead. The test looks for signs that blood flow to parts of your heart muscle is limited. It helps your doctor decide if you need further testing or treatment for blocked arteries. The test is very safe and takes about an hour.',
