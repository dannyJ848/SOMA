- Grandparents raising grandchildren
- Other relatives helping family members

**Important Facts:**
- Over 50 million Americans are caregivers
- Most caregivers are family members
- Many caregivers also have jobs and children
- Caregiving often lasts for several years

**Caregiving Can Be Hard**

**Physical Challenges:**
- Lifting or moving someone who needs help
- Less time for exercise and self-care
- Tiredness from being "on call" all the time
- Getting sick more often

**Emotional Challenges:**
- Feeling stressed or overwhelmed
- Worry about the person you're helping
- Sadness seeing someone you love decline
- Guilt when you can't do everything
- Feeling isolated from friends

**Caregivers Need Care Too**

**You can't pour from an empty cup** - this means you need to take care of yourself to be able to care for someone else.

**Signs You Need Help:**
- Feeling exhausted all the time
- Getting angry easily
- Having trouble sleeping

- Getting sick often
- Not seeing friends or doing things you enjoy

**Getting Help is Important**

**Ask family and friends:**

- "Can you help with Dad's doctor appointments?"
- "Can you pick up prescriptions?"

**Community Resources:**
- Senior centers
- Adult day programs
- Meal delivery services
- Transportation services
- Support groups

**Taking Care of Yourself**

**Health Basics:**
- See your own doctor regularly
- Take your own medicines
- Get enough sleep
- Eat healthy foods
- Exercise when you can

**Emotional Self-Care:**
- Take breaks - even 15 minutes helps
- Stay connected with friends
- Do hobbies you enjoy
- Join a caregiver support group
- Consider talking to a counselor

**Remember:**
- You're doing important work
- You can't do everything alone
- Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness
- Taking care of yourself helps you be a better caregiver`,

   - Duration and intensity of care
   - Living situation

2. **Caregiver values and preferences:**
   - Willingness to provide care
   - Cultural beliefs about caregiving
   - Goals for care recipient

3. **Caregiver capacity:**
   - Physical ability to provide care
   - Cognitive ability
   - Financial resources
   - Available time

4. **Caregiver needs:**
   - Education and training
   - Respite and support services
   - Financial assistance
   - Mental health services

## Population-Specific Considerations

### Diverse Populations

**Cultural Factors:**
- Filial piety in Asian cultures (obligation to care for elders)
- Family-centered vs. individual decision-making
- Stigma about mental health treatment

**Health Disparities:**
- Minority caregivers: Often younger, with fewer resources
- LGBTQ caregivers: May face family rejection, legal barriers
- Rural caregivers: Limited access to services, longer distances
- Sandwich generation: Caring for children and parents simultaneously

### Spousal vs. Adult Child Caregivers

**Spousal Caregivers:**
- Older age with more health problems
- More intense emotional involvement
- 24/7 co-residence
- May have fewer alternative supports
- Higher rates of depression and burden

**Adult Child Caregivers:**
- Competing responsibilities (work, children)
- May live at distance
- Relationship dynamics with siblings
- Role reversal challenges
- More likely to use formal services

### Working Caregivers

**Statistics:**
- 60% of caregivers work full- or part-time
- Average 15-20 hours/week caregiving
- Work performance affected
- Career advancement limited

**Workplace Support:**
