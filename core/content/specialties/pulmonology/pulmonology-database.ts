    pathophysiology: 'Flexible bronchoscopy passes a thin scope (5-6 mm) through the nose or mouth, past the vocal cords, and into the tracheobronchial tree under topical anesthesia and moderate sedation. Enables direct visualization of airway anatomy, mucosa, and lesions down to subsegmental bronchi.

EBUS (endobronchial ultrasound) allows real-time guided sampling of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Rigid bronchoscopy requires general anesthesia and provides a larger working channel for therapeutic interventions.',

It allows the doctor to look at your airways directly and take small tissue samples for testing. You will receive numbing medicine and sedation so you are comfortable and relaxed.
