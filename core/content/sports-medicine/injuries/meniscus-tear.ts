      explanation: `## What is a Meniscus Tear?

Each knee has two menisci - C-shaped pieces of cartilage that act like shock absorbers between your thigh bone and shin bone.

**What Happens**
- The meniscus can tear during twisting movements
- It can also wear down over time with age
- A torn piece can get caught in the knee joint

**Common Causes**
- Twisting your knee during sports
- Squatting or kneeling
- Aging and wear-and-tear
- Degenerative changes

**Symptoms**
- Pain on the side of the knee
- Swelling
- Knee catching or locking
- Feeling like your knee might give out

**Treatment**
- Rest, ice, and elevation
- Physical therapy
- Surgery for some tears`,

      summary: 'Meniscal tears occur through traumatic or degenerative mechanisms, presenting with joint line tenderness and mechanical symptoms, diagnosed by clinical exam and MRI, with treatment ranging from conservative management to surgical repair or resection.',
      explanation: `## Understanding Meniscus Tears

### Anatomy
- Two menisci per knee: medial and lateral
- C-shaped fibrocartilage
- Medial meniscus more commonly torn (less mobile)
- Blood supply: outer 1/3 (red zone), middle (red-white), inner (white zone)

### Mechanism of Injury
**Traumatic:**
- Twisting on planted foot
- Sudden pivoting
- Deep squatting with rotation
- Associated with ACL injuries

**Degenerative:**
- Gradual wear with age
- Minor trauma on already weakened tissue
- Common after age 40

### Tear Patterns
- Radial
- Longitudinal (including bucket handle)
- Horizontal
- Complex
- Root tears

### Clinical Presentation
**Acute Tears:**
- Immediate pain
- Effusion (hours to days)
- Mechanical symptoms: catching, locking

**Degenerative Tears:**
- Gradual onset
- Pain with squatting, stairs
- Intermittent swelling

### Physical Examination
| Test | Technique | Positive Finding |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| McMurray | Rotation with flexion/extension | Click + pain |
| Thessaly | Single-leg rotation at 20° | Pain, locking sensation |
| Joint Line | Palpation | Point tenderness |

### Imaging
- X-ray: Rule out arthritis, loose bodies
- MRI: Sensitivity 90-95% for meniscal tears

### Treatment
**Conservative:**
- For stable, degenerative tears
- Physical therapy
- Activity modification

**Surgical:**
- Repair: For peripheral tears in vascular zone
- Partial meniscectomy: For non-repairable tears
- Goal: Preserve as much meniscus as possible`,
      keyTerms: [
        { term: 'bucket handle tear', definition: 'Longitudinal meniscal tear where displaced fragment resembles bucket handle, causes locking' },
        { term: 'joint line tenderness', definition: 'Pain on palpation at the knee joint line, suggests meniscal pathology' },
        { term: 'red zone', definition: 'Vascular peripheral portion of meniscus with healing potential' },
      ],

      summary: 'Meniscal pathology spans from acute traumatic tears to degenerative changes, with treatment decisions based on tear characteristics, zone, patient factors, and associated pathology.',
      explanation: `## Meniscal Tear Management

### Tear Classification
**By Location:**
- Peripheral (red zone): Good healing
- Middle (red-white zone): Variable healing
- Central (white zone): Poor healing

**By Pattern:**
- Longitudinal: Often repairable
- Radial: Affects hoop stress function
- Horizontal: Usually degenerative
- Complex: Multiple patterns
- Root tears: Functional meniscectomy

### Biomechanical Implications
- Meniscus distributes 50-70% of load
- Meniscectomy increases contact stress 2-3x
- Root tears eliminate hoop stress function
- Accelerated arthritis after meniscectomy

### Diagnostic Accuracy
**Clinical Tests Pooled Data:**
- McMurray: Sensitivity 52%, Specificity 97%
- Joint line tenderness: Sensitivity 76%, Specificity 77%
- Combination improves accuracy

**MRI:**
- Sensitivity 90-95%
- False positives in degenerative knees
- Intrameniscal signal vs. tear

### Treatment Algorithm
**Factors Favoring Repair:**
- Young patient
- Peripheral location
- Longitudinal pattern
- Concomitant ACL reconstruction
- Acute injury

**Factors Favoring Partial Meniscectomy:**
- White zone tears
- Complex tears
- Degenerative changes
- Irreparable patterns

### Surgical Outcomes
**Meniscal Repair:**
- Success rates: 70-90%
- Higher with concurrent ACL reconstruction
- Longer rehab but better long-term

**Partial Meniscectomy:**
- Quick return to activity
- Increased arthritis risk long-term`,

      summary: 'Advanced meniscal management integrates understanding of biomechanical function, healing biology, and individualized treatment including repair augmentation and transplantation options.',
      explanation: `## Advanced Meniscal Concepts

### Biomechanics
**Load Distribution:**
- Hoop stress converts axial load to tensile force
- Radial tears disrupt circumferential fibers
- Root tears: 25% increase in tibiofemoral contact pressure
- Equivalent to total meniscectomy biomechanically

### Healing Biology
**Factors Affecting Healing:**
- Vascularity (peripheral better)
- Tear pattern and stability
- Mechanical environment
- Biological augmentation

**Repair Augmentation:**
- Fibrin clot
- PRP
- Stem cells
- Trephination

### Surgical Techniques
**Repair Methods:**
- Inside-out: Gold standard
- All-inside: Modern devices
- Outside-in: Anterior tears
- Vertical sutures stronger than horizontal

**Root Repair:**
- Trans-tibial pullout technique
- Reduces contact pressures
- Prevents progression of arthritis

### Meniscal Transplantation
**Indications:**
- Post-meniscectomy pain
- Young patient (<50)
- No significant arthritis
- Normal alignment and stability

**Considerations:**
- Sizing critical
- Lateral > medial outcomes
- Combined with osteotomy if malaligned

### Post-operative Rehabilitation
**Repair Protocol:**
- Protected weight-bearing 4-6 weeks
- ROM restrictions initially
- Return to sport 4-6 months

**Meniscectomy Protocol:**
- Early weight-bearing
- ROM as tolerated
- Return to sport 4-6 weeks`,
