      explanation: `## What Is Flexibility?

Flexibility is how far your muscles can stretch. Think about touching your toes - some people can reach their toes easily, while others can barely reach their knees!

## What Is Mobility?

Mobility is how well your joints can move in all directions. Good mobility helps you move smoothly and easily.

## Why Are They Important?

- Help you move better in sports
- Can help prevent injuries
- Make everyday activities easier
- Help you feel less stiff

## Types of Stretching

### Static Stretching
- Hold a stretch for 20-30 seconds
- Don't bounce!
- Should feel like a gentle pull, not pain
- Best after exercise when muscles are warm

### Dynamic Stretching
- Stretching while moving
- Like leg swings and arm circles
- Great for warming up before sports

## Tips for Stretching

**Do:**
- Warm up first (at least a little walking)
- Breathe normally while stretching
- Hold stretches gently - no bouncing
- Stretch regularly for best results

**Don't:**
- Force a stretch until it hurts
- Bounce while holding a stretch
- Rush through stretches
- Stretch a hurt muscle without asking an adult

## Simple Stretches Everyone Can Do

- Reach for the sky (arms up high)
- Touch your toes (or as close as you can)
- Neck rolls (look left, right, up, down)
- Arm circles (forward and backward)`,

      level: 3,
      summary: 'Flexibility and mobility training involves systematic targeting of neural, muscular, and connective tissue factors limiting range of motion, with evidence-based protocols tailored to individual limitations and sport-specific demands.',
      explanation: `## Physiology of Flexibility

### Limiting Factors

- Structural remodeling (limited evidence)

## Evidence-Based Stretching Protocols

### Static Stretching
**Dose-Response:**
- Duration: 15-30 seconds sufficient for most
- >60 seconds: Marginal additional benefit
- Frequency: Daily > 2-3x/week for maximal gains

**Acute Effects:**
- Increased ROM: Yes
- Decreased stiffness: Yes (temporary)
- Performance effects: Potential transient decrease in power
- Duration: Effects last ~15-30 minutes

### Dynamic Stretching
**Applications:**
- Pre-activity preparation
- Movement skill practice
- Neuromuscular activation

**Protocol:**
- 10-15 repetitions per movement
- Progressive amplitude
- Control speed (not ballistic)
- Sport-specific patterns

### PNF Techniques
**Types:**
1. **Contract-Relax (CR):** Contract agonist, relax, stretch
2. **Contract-Relax-Antagonist-Contract (CRAC):** Add antagonist contraction during stretch
3. **Hold-Relax:** Isometric contraction before stretch

**Mechanisms:**
- Autogenic inhibition (GTO involvement)
- Reciprocal inhibition (with CRAC)
- Reduced stretch perception

**Effectiveness:**
- May produce greater acute ROM gains than static
- Time and partner requirements limit practicality

## Mobility Assessment

### Clinical Tests
| Joint | Test | Normal Range |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Hip flexion | Thomas test, straight leg raise | 80-90° |
| Hip internal rotation | Seated or prone | 30-40° |
| Ankle dorsiflexion | Knee-to-wall | >10 cm or >35° |
| Shoulder flexion | Wall test | 170-180° |
| Thoracic rotation | Seated rotation | 45-55° |

### Movement Screening
**Overhead Squat Assessment:**
- Arms overhead, squat deep
- Observe: Foot, knee, hip, spine, arm position
- Identifies mobility and stability limitations

**Asymmetries:**
- >15% side-to-side difference may indicate issue
- Address limitations individually

## Sport-Specific Flexibility

### Requirements Vary by Sport
| Sport | Key Flexibility Needs |
|-------|----------------------|
| Swimming | Shoulder, ankle |
| Running | Hip flexor, hamstring, calf |
| Baseball throwing | Shoulder external rotation, hip |
| Gymnastics | Total body, extreme ranges |
| Soccer | Hip, hamstring, adductor |

### Excessive Flexibility Concerns
- Joint instability
- Increased injury risk in some contexts
- May impair power production
- Balance flexibility with stability

## Self-Myofascial Release (SMR)

### Foam Rolling Research
**Acute Effects:**

- Reduced muscle soreness perception
- No performance decrement (unlike long static stretching)

**Proposed Mechanisms:**
- Altered fascial properties
- Neural effects (reduced muscle tone)
- Increased blood flow
- Pain modulation

**Protocol:**

- Massage sticks
- Vibrating rollers
- Percussion devices

## Corrective Exercise Framework

### Address Limitations Systematically
1. **Release:** SMR to reduce tone/restrictions
2. **Lengthen:** Stretching to improve extensibility
3. **Activate:** Strengthen inhibited muscles
4. **Integrate:** Movement patterns incorporating changes

### Common Patterns
**Lower Crossed Syndrome:**
- Tight: Hip flexors, lumbar extensors
- Weak: Glutes, abdominals
- Address both flexibility and strength

**Upper Crossed Syndrome:**
- Tight: Pec major/minor, upper trap
- Weak: Deep neck flexors, lower trap
- Postural correction needed`,
