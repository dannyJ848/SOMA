      explanation: `## Why Prevent Injuries?

Getting hurt during sports or exercise is no fun! Injuries can:
- Make you miss games and practices
- Hurt a lot
- Take a long time to heal
- Sometimes have lasting effects

The good news is that many injuries can be prevented!

## Ways to Stay Safe

### Warm Up First
- Gets your muscles ready
- Increases blood flow
- Makes you more flexible
- Examples: Light jogging, jumping jacks, arm circles

### Use the Right Equipment
- Wear proper shoes for your sport
- Use helmets, pads, and guards when needed
- Make sure equipment fits correctly
- Replace worn-out gear

### Learn Proper Technique
- Have a coach teach you the right way
- Practice good form
- Don't skip the basics

### Rest When You Need To
- Tired muscles get injured more easily
- Take breaks during practice
- Get enough sleep
- Have rest days between hard workouts

### Listen to Your Body
- Pain is a warning sign
- Don't play through injuries
- Tell a coach or parent if something hurts

## Common Mistakes That Cause Injuries

- Skipping the warm-up
- Doing too much too soon
- Playing when tired or hurt
- Not drinking enough water
- Using wrong technique

## Remember

- Prevention is easier than healing
- Take care of your body
- Ask for help if something doesn't feel right`,

      summary: 'Sports injury prevention involves modifying risk factors through proper training, equipment, and technique while recognizing early warning signs of injury to reduce both acute and overuse injuries.',
      explanation: `## Understanding Sports Injuries

### Types of Injuries
**Acute Injuries:**
- Happen suddenly
- Examples: Sprains, strains, fractures
- Often from contact or sudden movements

**Overuse Injuries:**
- Develop gradually over time
- Examples: Tendinitis, stress fractures
- Result from repetitive stress

### Risk Factors for Injury

**Intrinsic (Personal) Factors:**
- Age and growth stage
- Fitness level
- Previous injuries
- Muscle imbalances
- Flexibility

**Extrinsic (External) Factors:**
- Playing surface
- Equipment
- Training errors
- Weather conditions
- Contact/collision

## Key Prevention Strategies

### Proper Training
**Progressive Overload:**
- Increase training gradually (10% rule)
- Allow adaptation time
- Balance intensity and rest

**Variety:**
- Cross-train to avoid overuse
- Balance different muscle groups
- Include rest days

### Warm-Up and Cool-Down
**Effective Warm-Up:**
- 10-15 minutes minimum
- Raise core temperature
- Dynamic movements (not just static stretching)
- Sport-specific preparation

**Cool-Down:**
- Gradual intensity reduction
- Helps remove metabolic waste
- May include stretching

### Proper Equipment
**Footwear:**
- Sport-appropriate
- Proper fit
- Replace when worn

**Protective Gear:**
- Helmets for appropriate sports
- Mouth guards
- Pads and guards
- Properly fitted

### Technique and Biomechanics
- Learn correct form from qualified coaches
- Video analysis can help
- Address movement dysfunctions

## Recognizing Warning Signs

### Early Warning Signs of Overuse
- Persistent soreness
- Pain that worsens with activity
- Decreased performance
- Swelling or stiffness

### When to Seek Help
- Pain that doesn't improve with rest
- Swelling that persists
- Joint instability
- Numbness or tingling

## Special Considerations

### Youth Athletes
- Growth plates are vulnerable
- Specialization too early increases risk
- Adequate rest and recovery
- Multi-sport participation protective

### Return from Injury
- Follow rehabilitation completely
- Gradual return to activity
- Address any weaknesses
- Don't rush the process

## Prevention Programs

Evidence-based programs like FIFA 11+ have shown:
- 30-50% reduction in injuries
- Improved strength and balance
- Cost-effective implementation`,

      level: 3,
      summary: 'Evidence-based injury prevention integrates biomechanical analysis, risk factor modification, and validated prevention programs targeting intrinsic and extrinsic factors to systematically reduce injury incidence across athletic populations.',
      explanation: `## Injury Prevention Model

### Translating Research to Prevention (van Mechelen Model)
1. Establish injury problem (incidence, severity)
2. Establish etiology and mechanisms
3. Introduce preventive measures
4. Assess effectiveness through RCTs

### Risk Factor Framework
**Predisposing Factors:**
- Age, sex, body composition
- Previous injury history
- Anatomical factors
- Psychological factors

**Enabling Factors:**
- Flexibility, strength, endurance
- Neuromuscular control
- Sport-specific fitness

**Precipitating Factors:**

## Load Management

### Training Load Concepts
**External Load:**
- Volume (distance, reps, sets)
- Intensity (speed, weight, power)
- Frequency

**Internal Load:**
- Physiological response
- sRPE (session RPE × duration)
- Heart rate measures
- Wellness questionnaires

### Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR)
**Calculation:**
- Acute: Last 7 days' load
- Chronic: Rolling 28-day average
- Ratio: Acute / Chronic

**Sweet Spot:**
- ACWR 0.8-1.3: Lower injury risk
- ACWR >1.5: Elevated injury risk (spike)
- ACWR <0.8: Detraining concerns

**Application:**
- Monitor weekly
- Avoid sudden load spikes
- Maintain chronic fitness

### Periodization for Injury Prevention
- Strategic variation of load
- Planned recovery periods
- Build fitness progressively
- Competition phase considerations

## Pre-Participation Screening

### Movement Screening
**Functional Movement Screen (FMS):**
- 7 movement tests
- Identifies asymmetries and limitations
- Predictive value debated but useful for baselines

**Y-Balance Test:**
- Dynamic balance assessment
- Identifies asymmetries
- Linked to injury risk in some populations

### Baseline Testing
- Strength measures
- Range of motion
- Balance assessment
- Sport-specific tests

## Implementation Considerations

### Compliance
- Simple programs better uptake
- Coach education critical
- Integration into practice routine
- Regular reinforcement

### Dose-Response
- Frequency: 2-3x/week minimum
- Duration: Season-long implementation
- Quality of execution matters

### Team vs. Individual Approach
- Program-based (all athletes same program)
- Individualized (based on screening)
- Hybrid approaches common`,

      level: 4,
      summary: 'Advanced injury prevention encompasses biomechanical modeling, load-response relationships, tissue adaptation science, and integrated monitoring systems to create individualized, data-driven prevention strategies targeting athlete-specific risk profiles.',
      explanation: `## Biomechanical Risk Factors

### Lower Extremity Mechanics

## Tissue Adaptation and Load Management

### Mechanotransduction
**Principle:**

- Underloading: Atrophy
- Overloading: Damage

**Tissue-Specific Adaptation:**
| Tissue | Adaptation Rate | Training Principle |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Muscle | Days-weeks | Progressive overload |
| Tendon | Weeks-months | High load, slow cycles |
| Bone | Weeks-months | Impact loading |
| Cartilage | Months-years | Moderate cyclic loading |

### Load-Response Modeling

- Fitness decays slower than fatigue
- Performance = Fitness - Fatigue

**Application:**
- Predict performance and injury risk
- Optimize training periodization
- Individual response profiles

### ACWR Refinements
**Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA):**
- More recent loads weighted more heavily
- May better predict injury than simple rolling average
- Accounts for training decay

**Combined Internal + External Load:**

- Internal load: Athlete response
- Both provide unique information
- Integration improves risk assessment
