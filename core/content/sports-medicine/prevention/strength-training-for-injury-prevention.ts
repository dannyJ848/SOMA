      explanation: `## Why Does Strength Training Prevent Injuries?

When your muscles are strong, they protect your body better!

### Strong Muscles Help By:
- Supporting your joints (like knees and ankles)
- Absorbing shock when you jump and land
- Helping you balance and not fall
- Making it easier to move correctly

## Simple Exercises That Help

### For Your Legs
- Squats (like sitting in a chair and standing up)
- Lunges (big steps forward or backward)
- Calf raises (standing on your tippy toes)

### For Your Core (Tummy and Back)
- Planks (holding your body straight like a board)
- Bird-dogs (balancing on hands and knees)
- Bridges (lifting your hips off the ground)

### For Your Upper Body
- Push-ups (or wall push-ups to start)
- Rows (pulling movements)

## Tips for Young Athletes

**Start Simple:**
- Use your own body weight first
- Learn the right way to do each exercise
- Don't lift heavy weights until you're older

**Be Consistent:**
- Do strength exercises 2-3 times per week
- It takes time to get stronger
- A little bit regularly is better than a lot once in a while

**Stay Safe:**
- Always warm up first
- Ask a coach or trainer to check your form
- Stop if something hurts

## Remember

- Strong athletes are safer athletes!
- It's not about being the strongest - it's about being strong enough
- Balance and control are just as important as strength`,

3. Individual risk factors
4. Current strength/weakness profile

### Exercise Selection
| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| Essential | Addresses top injury risks |
| Important | Sport-specific strength |
| Beneficial | General fitness/resilience |

### Periodization
**Off-Season:**
- Highest volume for strength development
- Address deficits aggressively
- Build foundation

**Pre-Season:**
- Maintain strength gains
- Transition to sport-specific power
- Reduce volume, increase intensity

**In-Season:**
- Maintenance programming
- 1-2 sessions per week minimum
- Manage fatigue

### Loading Parameters
| Goal | Intensity | Volume |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Strength | 70-85% 1RM | 3-5 sets × 4-8 reps |
| Hypertrophy | 60-75% 1RM | 3-4 sets × 8-12 reps |
| Endurance | 40-60% 1RM | 2-3 sets × 15-20 reps |

## Eccentric Training

- Address plateaus with variation
- Balance progression with recovery`,
