      summary: 'Warming up gets your body ready for exercise by raising your temperature and preparing your muscles, while cooling down helps your body recover afterward.',
      explanation: `## Why Warm Up?

Think of your body like a car on a cold morning. You wouldn\'t drive fast right away - you let the engine warm up first!

**Warming up helps:**
- Get your muscles ready to work
- Make your heart start pumping faster gradually
- Help you move better and faster
- Reduce your chance of getting hurt

## What Makes a Good Warm-Up?

### Start Easy
- Begin with light movement like walking or slow jogging
- This should take about 5 minutes

### Get Moving
- Do movements that are similar to your sport
- Examples: Arm circles, leg swings, skipping
- These are called "dynamic" exercises because you keep moving

### Get Ready for Your Sport
- Do some of the movements you'll do in your activity
- Slowly increase your effort
- Now you're ready to go!

## Why Cool Down?

After exercising hard, you shouldn't just stop suddenly!

**Cooling down helps:**
- Let your heart slow down gradually
- Help your muscles recover
- Remove waste products from exercise
- Help you feel less sore later

## What Makes a Good Cool-Down?

### Slow Down First
- Keep moving but at an easy pace
- Walk or do light activity for 5-10 minutes

### Stretch Your Muscles
- Hold stretches gently (don't bounce!)
- Hold each stretch for about 20-30 seconds
- This helps your muscles relax

## Remember

- Never skip the warm-up!
- A good warm-up takes about 10-15 minutes
- Don't rush the cool-down either`,

      summary: 'An effective warm-up increases core temperature, activates muscles, and prepares the nervous system for activity, while cool-downs facilitate recovery by gradually returning the body to resting state.',
      explanation: `## The Purpose of Warming Up

### Physiological Effects
- Increases heart rate and blood flow
- Raises muscle temperature
- Improves oxygen delivery
- Enhances nerve signal transmission
- Reduces muscle stiffness

### Performance Benefits
- Faster muscle contractions
- Improved reaction time
- Greater range of motion
- Better coordination
- Mental preparation

### Injury Prevention
- More pliable muscles and tendons
- Better shock absorption
- Improved neuromuscular control

## Components of an Effective Warm-Up

### Phase 1: General Warm-Up (5-10 minutes)
- Light aerobic activity
- Target: Raise core temperature, light sweat
- Examples: Jogging, cycling, rowing

### Phase 2: Dynamic Stretching (5-10 minutes)
- Active movements through range of motion
- Prepares specific muscle groups
- Examples:
  - Leg swings (forward/back, side to side)
  - Walking lunges with rotation
  - Arm circles and crosses
  - High knees, butt kicks

### Phase 3: Sport-Specific Activity (5 minutes)
- Movements mimicking the upcoming activity
- Progressively increasing intensity
- Examples: Practice throws, sprints, skill drills

## Static vs. Dynamic Stretching Before Exercise

| Type | When to Use | Effect on Performance |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| Static (holding stretches) | Cool-down, flexibility focus | May temporarily reduce power |
| Dynamic (moving stretches) | Warm-up | Maintains or improves performance |

**Key Point:** Dynamic stretching is preferred for warm-ups; static stretching is better saved for cool-downs.

## The Cool-Down

### Why Cool Down?
- Gradually lowers heart rate
- Helps clear metabolic waste (lactate)
- Redistributes blood (prevents pooling)
- Begins recovery process
- May reduce muscle soreness (debated)

### Components of Cool-Down

**Active Recovery (5-10 minutes):**
- Continued light movement
- Walking, easy cycling
- Allow heart rate to return toward normal

**Static Stretching (5-10 minutes):**
- Hold stretches 20-30 seconds
- Target major muscle groups used
- Don't stretch to point of pain

### Post-Exercise Stretching
- Muscles are warm and more pliable
- Ideal time to work on flexibility
- Focus on tight areas
- Breathe and relax into stretches

## Special Considerations

### Cold Weather
- Longer warm-up needed
- Keep muscles warm (extra layers)
- Gradual intensity increase

### Morning vs. Evening
- Morning: Stiffness may require longer warm-up
- Evening: Body temperature naturally higher

### Age Considerations
- Older athletes: Longer warm-up recommended
- Youth: Warm-up still important despite perception of not needing it`,

## Static Stretching: Pre-Exercise Considerations

### Current Evidence
**Acute Effects:**

- Effects diminish if followed by sport-specific warm-up

**When Potentially Appropriate:**
- Sports requiring extreme flexibility
- If followed by dynamic activity
- Individual preference (psychological benefit)

**Duration Considerations:**
- <30 seconds per stretch: Minimal performance impact
- >60 seconds: Greater performance decrement

## Cool-Down Physiology

### Cardiovascular Recovery
**Heart Rate Recovery:**
- Parasympathetic reactivation
- Gradual blood redistribution
- Prevention of venous pooling

**Active vs. Passive Recovery:**
- Active: Maintains blood flow, enhances lactate clearance
- Passive: May be preferred after very high intensity

### Metabolic Recovery
**Lactate Clearance:**
- Active recovery at ~30-40% VO2max
- Faster clearance than passive rest
- May or may not affect next-day performance

### Stretching in Cool-Down
**Potential Benefits:**
- Muscles warm and compliant
- Time for flexibility improvement
- Psychological transition
- Range of motion maintenance

**Evidence for DOMS Prevention:**
- Limited evidence for reduction in muscle soreness
- May have small effect, individual variation
- Other recovery strategies (nutrition, sleep) likely more impactful

## Sport-Specific Considerations

### Endurance Sports

- Extended aerobic cool-down
- Flexibility focus on primary movers

### Power/Sprint Sports
- Shorter dynamic warm-up
- PAP considerations
- Neural activation emphasis
