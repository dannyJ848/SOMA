# Before Surgery: Complete Preparation Guide

## Overview

Proper preparation before surgery helps ensure the safest possible procedure and best outcomes. This guide covers everything you need to know from scheduling through the day of surgery.

**Complexity Level: 2 (Basic)**

## Preoperative Testing

### Why Testing Is Needed

Before surgery, your medical team needs to understand your overall health status. Tests help identify any conditions that could affect your surgery or anesthesia.

### Common Preoperative Tests

**Blood Tests**
- Complete blood count (CBC): Checks for anemia, infection, clotting ability
- Basic metabolic panel: Evaluates kidney function and electrolytes
- Coagulation studies: Ensures blood clots properly
- Blood type and crossmatch: Prepares blood if transfusion needed

**Heart Tests**
- Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG): Records heart rhythm
- Sometimes: Stress test or echocardiogram for major surgeries

**Imaging**
- Chest X-ray: Checks lungs and heart size
- Surgery-specific imaging as needed

**Other Tests**
- Urinalysis: Screens for infection
- Pregnancy test: For women of childbearing age
- COVID-19 or other infectious disease screening

### When Tests Are Done

- Usually 1-30 days before surgery depending on type
- Results must be recent enough to be valid
- Some tests may need to be repeated if surgery is delayed

## Medication Adjustments

### Critical: Blood Thinners

**Why This Matters**
Blood thinners increase bleeding risk during surgery. Most need to be stopped temporarily.

**Common Blood Thinners and Typical Timing**

| Medication | Generic Name | Typical Stop Time |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Coumadin | Warfarin | 5-7 days before |
| Eliquis | Apixaban | 2-3 days before |
| Xarelto | Rivaroxaban | 2-3 days before |
| Pradaxa | Dabigatran | 2-5 days before |
| Plavix | Clopidogrel | 5-7 days before |
| Aspirin | Aspirin | Varies by surgery |

**Important**
- Never stop blood thinners without surgeon's specific instructions
- Some patients need "bridging" with injectable blood thinners
- Your surgeon will coordinate with your cardiologist if needed

### Diabetes Medications

**Oral Diabetes Medications**
- Metformin: Usually stopped day before surgery
- Sulfonylureas (glipizide, glyburide): Skip morning of surgery
- SGLT2 inhibitors: May stop 3-4 days before
- Follow specific instructions from your care team

**Insulin**
- Type 1 diabetes: Usually reduce long-acting insulin
- Type 2 diabetes: May skip or reduce morning dose
- Never stop all insulin without medical guidance
- Bring your insulin to the hospital

**Blood Sugar Monitoring**
- Check blood sugar morning of surgery
- Target usually 100-180 mg/dL
- Call if blood sugar very high or very low

### Other Medication Considerations

**Usually Continue**
- Blood pressure medications (may take with sip of water)
- Heart medications (beta blockers, etc.)
- Thyroid medications
- Anti-seizure medications
- Asthma inhalers

**Usually Stop Temporarily**
- Herbal supplements (2 weeks before)
- Vitamin E (1 week before)
- Fish oil (1 week before)
- NSAIDs like ibuprofen, naproxen (1 week before)
- Weight loss medications

**Always Discuss**
- Immunosuppressants
- Steroids (may need adjustment, not abrupt stop)
- Psychiatric medications
- Hormone therapy

## Fasting Guidelines (NPO Instructions)

### Why Fasting Is Essential

An empty stomach prevents aspiration - when stomach contents enter the lungs during anesthesia. This can cause serious, sometimes fatal complications.

### Standard Fasting Guidelines

**For General Anesthesia or Sedation**

| Food/Drink Type | Stop Eating/Drinking |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Solid food | 8 hours before |
| Milk, formula | 6 hours before |
| Light meal (toast, clear soup) | 6 hours before |
| Breast milk | 4 hours before |
| Clear liquids | 2 hours before |

**Clear Liquids Include**
- Water
- Apple juice, white grape juice
- Black coffee (no cream)
- Tea (no milk)
- Clear sports drinks
- Gatorade, Pedialyte

**Clear Liquids Do NOT Include**
- Milk or cream
- Orange juice with pulp
- Smoothies
- Alcohol

### Special Situations

**If Your Surgery Is in the Afternoon**
- You may have a light breakfast early morning
- Follow specific timing from your surgical team

**Diabetic Patients**
- May need modified fasting to prevent low blood sugar
- Usually can have clear liquids with sugar if needed
- Always follow your specific instructions

**Children**
- Different guidelines apply
- Pediatric team will provide specific instructions

### What If You Eat or Drink?

**Be Honest** - Tell your surgical team if you ate or drank
- Surgery may need to be delayed or rescheduled
- The risk of aspiration is too serious to ignore
- Your safety is the priority
