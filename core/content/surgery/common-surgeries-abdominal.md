# Common Surgeries: Abdominal Procedures

## Overview

This guide covers three of the most common abdominal surgeries: appendectomy, cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal), and hernia repair. Understanding what to expect can help reduce anxiety and prepare you for recovery.

**Complexity Level: 2 (Basic)**

# Appendectomy (Appendix Removal)

## What Is the Appendix?

The appendix is a small, finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine in the lower right abdomen. While it may have some immune function, the body functions normally without it.

## Why Is Appendectomy Needed?

**Appendicitis** occurs when the appendix becomes blocked and infected. Without treatment, an infected appendix can burst, spreading infection throughout the abdomen.

### Symptoms of Appendicitis
- Pain starting around the navel, moving to lower right abdomen
- Pain that worsens with movement, coughing, sneezing
- Nausea and vomiting
- Loss of appetite
- Low-grade fever
- Abdominal swelling

### Why Surgery Is Urgent
- Appendicitis is a medical emergency
- A ruptured appendix can cause life-threatening infection
- Most appendectomies are performed within hours of diagnosis

## Types of Appendectomy

### Laparoscopic Appendectomy (Most Common)
- 3 small incisions (1/4 to 1/2 inch)
- Camera and instruments inserted through incisions
- Appendix removed through small opening
- Faster recovery, less pain, smaller scars

### Open Appendectomy
- One larger incision (2-4 inches)
- Used if appendix has ruptured or for complex cases
- Direct visualization for complicated infections
- Longer recovery time

## What to Expect

### Before Surgery
- Blood tests and imaging (CT scan or ultrasound)
- IV fluids and antibiotics started immediately
- Surgery usually within 24 hours of diagnosis
- No eating or drinking once appendicitis is suspected

### During Surgery
- General anesthesia (you're completely asleep)
- Surgery takes 30-60 minutes typically
- Appendix is removed and sent to pathology
- Incisions closed with stitches or surgical glue

### Recovery Timeline

**In the Hospital**
- Laparoscopic: Usually home same day or next day
- Open: 2-3 days in hospital
- IV antibiotics if appendix was ruptured

**At Home**
- Week 1: Rest, walk short distances, manage pain
- Week 2: Light activities, no lifting over 10 pounds
- Weeks 3-4: Gradual return to normal activities
- 4-6 weeks: Resume strenuous activity and exercise

### What to Watch For After Surgery
- Fever over 101.5°F
- Increasing abdominal pain
- Redness, swelling, or drainage from incisions
- Nausea and vomiting that doesn't improve
- No bowel movement for 3+ days

# Cholecystectomy (Gallbladder Removal)

## What Is the Gallbladder?

The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ beneath the liver that stores bile (digestive fluid). When you eat fatty foods, the gallbladder releases bile to help digest fat.

## Why Is Cholecystectomy Needed?

### Gallstones
Hardened deposits form in the gallbladder, ranging from sand-grain to golf ball size.

**Symptoms of Gallbladder Problems**
- Sudden, intense pain in upper right abdomen
- Pain between shoulder blades or right shoulder
- Nausea and vomiting
- Pain after eating fatty foods
- Episodes lasting 30 minutes to several hours

### Other Reasons for Surgery
- Gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis)
- Gallbladder polyps
- Gallbladder doesn't empty properly (biliary dyskinesia)
- Pancreatitis caused by gallstones

## Life Without a Gallbladder

**Good News**: Most people live completely normally without a gallbladder.

**How Digestion Works After**
- Liver continues making bile
- Bile flows directly into small intestine
- Most people notice no dietary changes
- Some may have looser stools initially

## Types of Cholecystectomy

### Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy (Standard Approach)
- 4 small incisions in abdomen
- Camera and instruments remove gallbladder
- 95% of gallbladder surgeries are laparoscopic
- Outpatient or overnight stay

### Single-Incision Laparoscopic Surgery
- One incision in the belly button
- Cosmetically hidden scar
- Not appropriate for all patients

### Open Cholecystectomy
- One larger incision (4-6 inches)
- Used for complicated cases or if laparoscopic isn't safe
- Longer recovery (4-6 weeks)

## What to Expect

### Before Surgery
- Preoperative testing (blood work, imaging)
- Usually scheduled surgery (not emergency)
- Fasting after midnight
- Arrive 1-2 hours before surgery time

### During Surgery
- General anesthesia
- Surgery takes 1-2 hours
- Gallbladder carefully separated from liver
- Bile duct checked for stones
- Gallbladder removed through incision

### Recovery Timeline

**Day of Surgery**
- Wake in recovery room
- Sip liquids when awake
- Walk with assistance
- Usually home same day

**First Week**
- Shoulder pain common (from gas used in surgery)
- Manage pain with prescribed medications
- Walk regularly to prevent blood clots
- Start with bland, low-fat foods
- No driving while on pain medications

**Weeks 2-4**
- Gradually increase activity
- Return to work (1-2 weeks for desk jobs)
- No lifting over 10-15 pounds
- Slowly reintroduce normal diet

**After 4 Weeks**
- Most restrictions lifted
- Resume exercise and normal activities
- Full recovery

### Dietary Adjustments After Surgery

**First Few Weeks**
- Eat smaller, more frequent meals
- Avoid high-fat and fried foods
- Stay hydrated
- Add fiber gradually to prevent diarrhea

**Long Term**
- Most people return to normal diet
- Some remain sensitive to very fatty foods
- Listen to your body's signals

# Hernia Repair

## What Is a Hernia?

A hernia occurs when an organ or tissue pushes through a weak spot in the muscle or connective tissue that normally holds it in place. The most visible sign is often a bulge under the skin.

## Types of Hernias

### Inguinal Hernia (Most Common)
- Located in the groin area
- More common in men
- Intestine pushes through inguinal canal
- May extend into scrotum

### Umbilical Hernia
- Located at or near the belly button
- Common in infants and adults
- Often seen in women after pregnancy
- Can occur with obesity or heavy lifting

### Incisional Hernia
- Occurs at site of previous surgery
- Tissue pushes through weakened surgical scar
- More common after open abdominal surgery

### Hiatal Hernia
- Stomach pushes up through diaphragm
- Located in chest area
- Causes heartburn and reflux
- May not require surgery

### Femoral Hernia
- Located in upper thigh/groin
- More common in women
- Higher risk of complications

## Symptoms of Hernia

**What You May Notice**
- Visible bulge in affected area
- Bulge may appear when standing, coughing, straining
- Bulge may disappear when lying down
- Dull ache or pain at bulge site
- Discomfort with lifting or bending

**Warning Signs - Seek Immediate Care**
- Severe pain at hernia site
- Bulge that can't be pushed back in
- Nausea and vomiting
- Fever
- Bulge that becomes red, purple, or dark
*These may indicate strangulated hernia - a surgical emergency*

## Why Repair Is Recommended

Hernias don't heal on their own and typically enlarge over time. Risks of not repairing include:
- Incarceration (tissue gets stuck)
- Strangulation (blood supply cut off)
- Bowel obstruction
- Emergency surgery with higher complications

## Types of Hernia Repair

### Laparoscopic Repair
- 3 small incisions
- Mesh placed to reinforce weak area
- Faster recovery, less pain
- Good for bilateral (both sides) hernias
- May not be suitable for large or complex hernias

### Open Repair
- One incision over hernia site
- Tissue pushed back into place
- Mesh typically used to reinforce repair
- May be preferred for large hernias
- Local, regional, or general anesthesia options

### Robotic Repair
- Surgeon controls robotic instruments
- Enhanced precision and visualization
- Similar recovery to laparoscopic

### Mesh vs. No Mesh

**Mesh Repair (Most Common)**
- Lower recurrence rate
- Synthetic or biological materials
- Provides permanent reinforcement
- Slight risk of mesh-related complications

**Primary Repair (No Mesh)**
- Tissue sewn together
- Higher recurrence rate
- May be used for small hernias or in presence of infection

## What to Expect

### Before Surgery
- Usually scheduled (not emergency)
- Preoperative testing
- May be outpatient or short hospital stay
- Discuss anesthesia options with your team

### During Surgery
- Surgery takes 30-90 minutes
- Hernia contents pushed back in place
- Weak area reinforced (usually with mesh)
- Incisions closed with stitches or glue

### Recovery Timeline

**Day of Surgery**
- Ice packs to reduce swelling
- Walk same day
- Usually home within hours

**First Week**
- Pain and swelling at surgical site
- Limited activity
- No lifting more than 10 pounds
- May need stool softeners (straining is bad)

**Weeks 2-4**
- Gradually increase activity
- Return to desk work (1-2 weeks)
- Avoid strenuous activity
- No heavy lifting

**Weeks 4-6**
- Most normal activities resumed
- May return to physical work
- Exercise can resume (start slowly)

### Tips for Smooth Recovery

- Use ice packs first 48 hours
- Support incision when coughing or sneezing
- Prevent constipation with fiber and fluids
- Wear supportive underwear if inguinal hernia
- Avoid heavy lifting until cleared
- Don't smoke (impairs healing)
