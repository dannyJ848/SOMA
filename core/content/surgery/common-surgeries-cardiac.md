# Common Surgeries: Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)

## Overview

Coronary artery bypass grafting, commonly called CABG (pronounced "cabbage") or bypass surgery, is one of the most performed heart surgeries. It creates new pathways for blood to flow to the heart muscle when coronary arteries are blocked.

**Complexity Level: 3-4 (Intermediate to Advanced)**

## Understanding Coronary Artery Disease

### The Problem

Coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle. When these arteries become narrowed or blocked by plaque (atherosclerosis), the heart doesn't get enough blood. This is called coronary artery disease (CAD).

### What Happens With Blocked Arteries
- **Angina**: Chest pain or pressure, especially with exertion
- **Shortness of breath**: Heart can't pump efficiently
- **Heart attack**: Complete blockage cuts off blood flow
- **Heart failure**: Weakened heart muscle over time

### The Three Main Coronary Arteries
1. **Left anterior descending (LAD)**: Supplies front and bottom of heart
2. **Left circumflex (LCx)**: Supplies back and side of heart
3. **Right coronary artery (RCA)**: Supplies bottom and back of heart

The left main coronary artery splits into the LAD and LCx, making it critical.

## What Is Coronary Bypass Surgery?

### The Concept

Bypass surgery creates a detour around blocked arteries using blood vessels from elsewhere in your body. Blood flows through these new "bypasses" to reach the heart muscle beyond the blockage.

### The Bypass Grafts

**Where Grafts Come From**

1. **Internal Mammary Arteries (IMA)**
   - Left internal mammary (LIMA) - most important
   - Right internal mammary (RIMA)
   - Located inside chest wall
   - Best long-term results
   - Usually used for LAD (most critical artery)

2. **Saphenous Vein**
   - Taken from the leg
   - Most commonly used graft
   - Good results but may narrow over years
   - Long enough for multiple bypasses

3. **Radial Artery**
   - Taken from forearm
   - Good results
   - Only one arm's artery used
   - Hand circulation tested first

### Naming the Surgery

Surgery is named by number of bypasses:
- **Single bypass**: 1 graft
- **Double bypass**: 2 grafts
- **Triple bypass**: 3 grafts
- **Quadruple bypass**: 4 grafts
- **Quintuple bypass**: 5 grafts

More bypasses doesn't mean worse condition - it means all significant blockages are being addressed.

## When Is CABG Recommended?

### Typical Candidates
- Left main coronary artery disease
- Three-vessel disease (all three major arteries blocked)
- Blocked arteries not suitable for stents
- Failed previous stents
- Diabetes with multi-vessel disease
- Reduced heart function with blockages

### CABG vs. Stents

| Feature | CABG | Stents (PCI) |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Invasiveness | Open surgery | Catheter-based |
| Hospital stay | 4-7 days | 1-2 days |
| Recovery | 6-12 weeks | 1-2 weeks |
| Best for | Multi-vessel, complex | 1-2 vessel, simple |
| Repeat procedures | Less likely needed | May need additional |
| Diabetics | Often preferred | May be less durable |

## Types of CABG Surgery

### Traditional On-Pump CABG
- Heart-lung machine takes over circulation
- Heart stopped during surgery
- Surgeon works on still heart
- Most common approach

### Off-Pump CABG (Beating Heart Surgery)
- Heart continues beating during surgery
- No heart-lung machine
- Special stabilizing device holds heart still
- May reduce some complications
- Technically more challenging

### Minimally Invasive CABG
- Smaller incisions
- Specialized instruments
- Not suitable for all patients
- Faster recovery

### Hybrid Procedures
- Combines surgery and stent procedures
- LIMA graft surgically placed
- Other arteries treated with stents
- Reduces surgical extent

---

## Preparing for CABG Surgery

### Medical Preparation

**Weeks Before**
- Cardiac catheterization confirms blockage locations
- Complete medical evaluation
- Optimize other medical conditions
- Adjust medications as directed
- Stop smoking immediately (critical for healing)
- Dental work if needed

**Medications to Discuss**
- Blood thinners may be stopped
- Aspirin regimen may change
- Diabetes medications adjusted
- Continue heart medications as directed

### Physical Preparation

**Prehabilitation**
- Walking program if possible
- Breathing exercises
- Nutritional optimization
- Quit smoking (cannot be overemphasized)

### Home Preparation

- Arrange 2-4 weeks of help at home
- Ground floor living preferred initially
- Prepare easy meals or arrange meal delivery
- Pillow for car ride home (protects chest)
- Loose, comfortable clothing

---

## What to Expect

### Day Before Surgery
- Hospital admission (sometimes same day)
- Final blood tests and preparation
- Surgical site may be shaved
- Shower with antibacterial soap
- Nothing to eat or drink after midnight

### Day of Surgery

**Pre-Operative Area**
- IV lines placed
- Additional monitoring lines
- Anesthesia team consultation
- Final verification of procedure

**Operating Room**
- General anesthesia (completely asleep)
- Breathing tube placed after asleep
- Full monitoring established
- Surgery begins

### During Surgery (3-6 Hours)

**Traditional CABG Steps**

1. **Incision**: Vertical cut down center of chest (sternotomy)

2. **Harvest grafts**: Team obtains vein from leg and/or artery from chest wall

3. **Heart-lung machine connected**: Blood diverted through machine
   - Machine oxygenates blood
   - Heart can be stopped safely
   - Temperature may be lowered

4. **Bypasses created**:
   - Grafts sewn to coronary arteries beyond blockages
   - Each bypass takes 15-30 minutes

5. **Heart restarted**:
   - Heart-lung machine gradually disconnected
   - Heart resumes beating

6. **Chest closed**:
   - Sternal wires close breastbone
   - Layers of tissue closed
   - Drainage tubes placed

- Walking in hallways
- Education about recovery

**Phase 2: Outpatient (6-12 weeks)**
- 2-3 sessions per week
- Monitored exercise
- Nutrition counseling
- Stress management
- Risk factor education

**Phase 3: Maintenance**
- Ongoing exercise program
- Lifestyle maintenance
- May be gym-based

### Benefits of Cardiac Rehab
- Reduces risk of future heart problems
- Improves exercise capacity
- Better quality of life
- Reduces depression
- Helps with weight management
- Provides confidence to exercise safely

## Potential Complications

### Common Issues (Usually Manageable)

- **Atrial fibrillation**: Irregular heart rhythm (20-40% of patients)
  - Usually temporary
  - Treated with medications
  - Usually resolves before discharge

- **Swelling**: Leg swelling if saphenous vein used
  - Elevate legs
  - Compression stockings
  - Improves over weeks

- **Incision pain**: Normal during healing
  - Gradually improves
  - Report if worsening

- **Fatigue**: Very common
  - Improves over weeks
  - Rest is important

### Serious Complications (Less Common)

- **Bleeding**: May require return to surgery (2-5%)
- **Infection**:
  - Superficial wound infection
  - Deep sternal wound infection (rare but serious)
- **Stroke**: (1-2%)
- **Kidney problems**: Usually temporary
- **Memory/cognitive changes**: Usually temporary

### Long-Term Considerations

- **Graft failure**: Vein grafts may narrow over 10-15 years
- Arterial grafts (LIMA) have better long-term patency
- May eventually need additional treatment

---

## Medications After CABG

### Typical Long-Term Medications

**Almost Everyone**
- **Aspirin**: Prevents clots in grafts
- **Statin**: Lowers cholesterol, protects grafts (crucial)
- **Beta-blocker**: Protects heart, controls rhythm

**Many Patients**
- **ACE inhibitor/ARB**: Protects heart
- **Second antiplatelet**: Sometimes temporary
- **Blood pressure medications**: As needed

### The Importance of Statins
- Critical for graft longevity
- Lower LDL cholesterol aggressively
- Reduce inflammation in arteries
- Take even if cholesterol "normal"

---

## Lifestyle Changes for Long-Term Success

### Heart-Healthy Diet
- Mediterranean-style diet
- Plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains
- Lean proteins (fish, poultry)
- Limit saturated fat and sodium
- Avoid processed foods

### Exercise
- Regular aerobic exercise
- 150 minutes per week minimum
- Cardiac rehab provides foundation
- Maintain lifelong habit

### Risk Factor Control
- Quit smoking permanently
- Control blood pressure
- Manage diabetes carefully
- Maintain healthy weight
- Manage stress

### Regular Follow-Up
