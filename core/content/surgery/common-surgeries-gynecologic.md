# Common Surgeries: Hysterectomy and Cesarean Section

## Overview

This guide covers two important gynecologic and obstetric surgeries: hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) and cesarean section (surgical birth). Understanding these procedures helps patients prepare mentally and physically.

**Complexity Level: 2-3 (Basic to Intermediate)**

# Hysterectomy

## What Is a Hysterectomy?

A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus. It is one of the most common surgeries performed on women, with approximately 600,000 performed annually in the United States.

## Reasons for Hysterectomy

### Common Conditions

**Uterine Fibroids** (Most Common Reason)
- Non-cancerous growths in uterine wall
- Can cause heavy bleeding, pain, pressure
- May cause anemia from blood loss

**Endometriosis**
- Tissue similar to uterine lining grows outside uterus
- Causes severe pain, especially during periods
- Definitive treatment when other options fail

**Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**
- Heavy or prolonged periods
- Bleeding between periods
- Bleeding after menopause

**Uterine Prolapse**
- Uterus drops into or out of vagina
- Caused by weakened support structures
- More common after multiple vaginal births

**Chronic Pelvic Pain**
- When other treatments haven't helped
- Often related to other conditions listed

**Cancer or Precancer**
- Uterine (endometrial) cancer
- Cervical cancer
- Ovarian cancer (ovaries also removed)
- Severe precancerous conditions

## Types of Hysterectomy

### By What Is Removed

**Total Hysterectomy** (Most Common)
- Uterus and cervix removed
- Ovaries may or may not be removed

**Subtotal (Partial) Hysterectomy**
- Uterus removed, cervix left in place
- Less common today
- Still need cervical cancer screening

**Total Hysterectomy with Salpingo-Oophorectomy**
- Uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes, and ovaries removed
- Necessary for ovarian cancer
- Causes surgical menopause if premenopausal

### About Keeping or Removing Ovaries

**Reasons to Remove Ovaries**
- Cancer risk reduction (BRCA gene carriers)
- Ovarian cancer treatment
- Severe endometriosis involving ovaries
- Patient preference

**Reasons to Keep Ovaries**
- Preserves natural hormones until menopause
- Reduces cardiovascular disease risk
- No increased ovarian cancer risk
- Avoids surgical menopause symptoms

### Surgical Approaches

**Vaginal Hysterectomy**
- Uterus removed through vagina
- No abdominal incision
- Fastest recovery
- Ideal for prolapse or smaller uterus

**Laparoscopic Hysterectomy**
- Small incisions in abdomen
- Camera and instruments used
- Less pain, faster recovery than open
- Most common approach today

**Robotic Hysterectomy**
- Type of laparoscopic surgery
- Surgeon controls robotic arms
- Enhanced precision
- Similar recovery to laparoscopic

**Abdominal Hysterectomy (Open)**
- Large incision in lower abdomen
- Best visualization
- Necessary for very large uterus or cancer
- Longest recovery

## Before Surgery

### Important Considerations

**This Is Permanent**
- You will no longer have periods
- You cannot become pregnant after hysterectomy
- If ovaries removed, menopause begins immediately

**Questions to Ask**
- Is this surgery necessary, or are there alternatives?
- Which type of hysterectomy do you recommend and why?
- Should my ovaries be removed?
- What should I expect during recovery?

### Medical Preparation
- Complete medical evaluation
- Blood tests and imaging
- Stop certain medications as directed
- May need bowel preparation

## What to Expect

### Day of Surgery

**For All Types**
- General anesthesia (or regional for vaginal)
- Surgery takes 1-3 hours
- Wake in recovery room
- Pain management begins immediately

### Hospital Stay

| Approach | Typical Stay |
|----------|-------------|
| Vaginal | Same day to 1 day |
| Laparoscopic/Robotic | Same day to 1 day |
| Abdominal | 2-3 days |

### Recovery Timeline

**First 2 Weeks**

**If Ovaries Removed (Surgical Menopause)**
- Immediate menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, etc.)
- May need hormone therapy
- Discuss risks and benefits with doctor

**If Ovaries Kept**
- Still produce hormones until natural menopause
- May still have cyclic symptoms
- No periods, but ovaries continue functioning

### Emotional Considerations

# Cesarean Section (C-Section)

## What Is a Cesarean Section?

A cesarean section is the delivery of a baby through surgical incisions in the mother's abdomen and uterus. Approximately 32% of births in the United States are cesarean deliveries.

## Reasons for Cesarean Section

### Planned (Scheduled) C-Sections

**Medical Reasons**
- Placenta previa (placenta covers cervix)
- Previous classical (vertical) uterine incision
- Certain fetal positions (transverse lie)
- Multiple previous C-sections
- Active genital herpes outbreak
- Certain birth defects
- HIV with high viral load

**Sometimes Planned**
- Breech presentation (bottom first)
- Large baby (especially with diabetes)
- Previous C-section (repeat cesarean)

### Emergency or Unplanned C-Sections

**During Labor**
- Labor not progressing (most common reason)
- Baby showing signs of distress
- Umbilical cord problems
- Placental abruption
- Uterine rupture
- Maternal health emergency

## Planned vs. Emergency C-Section

| Aspect | Planned | Emergency |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Timing | Scheduled date | During labor |
| Preparation | Full preparation | Quick decisions |
| Anesthesia | Usually spinal | Spinal, epidural, or general |
| Emotional experience | Time to prepare | May be stressful |
| Partner present | Usually yes | Often yes (unless general anesthesia) |

## Types of Incisions

### Skin Incision (What You See)

**Low Transverse (Bikini Cut)**
- Horizontal cut below bikini line
- Most common
- Heals well, less visible scar
- Stronger healing

**Vertical (Midline)**
- Up-and-down incision
- Faster access for emergencies
- More visible scar
- More uncomfortable healing

### Uterine Incision (Inside)

**Low Transverse** (Most Common)
- Horizontal cut in lower uterus
- Allows VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) option
- Lower risk of rupture in future pregnancies

**Classical (Vertical)**
- Vertical cut in upper uterus
- Used for certain emergencies or very premature babies
- Future pregnancies must be cesarean (rupture risk)

## Preparing for a Planned C-Section

### Before Surgery

**Medical Preparation**

- Discussion of anesthesia
- Consent forms signed
- When to stop eating/drinking

**What to Bring**

## Future Pregnancies After C-Section

### Options for Next Delivery

**VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean)**

- Success rate 60-80% for good candidates
- Discuss with your provider
- Must deliver at hospital equipped for emergency C-section

**Repeat Cesarean**
- Predictable timing

- Each C-section slightly increases risks
- Usually recommended after 2-3 C-sections

### Considerations

**Waiting Between Pregnancies**
- Recommended: at least 18 months between delivery and next conception
- Allows uterus to heal fully
- Reduces complications

**Number of C-Sections**
- Multiple C-sections increase surgical complexity
- Scar tissue accumulates
- Placenta problems more likely
- Discuss family planning with provider
