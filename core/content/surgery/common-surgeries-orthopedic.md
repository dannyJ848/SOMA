# Common Surgeries: Joint Replacement (Hip and Knee)

## Overview

Joint replacement surgery, also called arthroplasty, replaces damaged joint surfaces with artificial components. This guide covers hip and knee replacement, two of the most successful surgeries in modern medicine.

**Complexity Level: 2-3 (Basic to Intermediate)**

# Hip Replacement Surgery

## Understanding the Hip Joint

The hip is a ball-and-socket joint:
- **Ball**: Head of the femur (thighbone)
- **Socket**: Acetabulum (part of pelvis)
- **Cartilage**: Covers both surfaces, allowing smooth movement
- **Function**: Bears body weight, allows walking, sitting, bending

## Why Hip Replacement Is Needed

### Osteoarthritis (Most Common Reason)
- Cartilage wears away over time
- Bones rub against each other
- Causes pain, stiffness, limited mobility
- Usually develops after age 50

### Other Conditions
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Autoimmune inflammation damages joint
- **Avascular necrosis**: Loss of blood supply to femoral head
- **Hip fracture**: Sometimes best treated with replacement
- **Hip dysplasia**: Abnormal hip development

### When Surgery Is Recommended
- Pain significantly affects daily life
- Pain interferes with sleep
- Stiffness limits normal activities
- Non-surgical treatments no longer help
- Walking aids are needed for short distances

## Types of Hip Replacement

### Total Hip Replacement (Most Common)
- Both ball and socket replaced
- Femoral head removed and replaced with metal or ceramic ball
- Socket lined with plastic, metal, or ceramic

### Partial Hip Replacement (Hemiarthroplasty)
- Only femoral head replaced
- Usually for certain hip fractures
- Not typically for arthritis

### Hip Resurfacing
- Femoral head reshaped and capped with metal
- Preserves more bone
- Usually for younger, larger, active patients

## The Artificial Hip

### Components
1. **Acetabular cup**: Replaces socket (metal outer, plastic/ceramic liner)
2. **Femoral stem**: Inserted into thighbone
3. **Femoral head**: Ball that attaches to stem (metal or ceramic)

### Materials
- Titanium and cobalt-chrome alloys
- High-grade polyethylene (plastic)
- Ceramic
- Designed to last 20-30+ years

### Fixation Methods
- **Cemented**: Bone cement secures components
- **Uncemented**: Bone grows into porous surface (most common now)
- **Hybrid**: Socket cemented, stem uncemented

## What to Expect

### Before Surgery

**Preparation Period**
- Medical evaluation to ensure fitness for surgery
- Dental work completed (infection prevention)
- Weight optimization if needed
- Stop smoking (crucial for healing)
- Strengthen leg muscles (prehabilitation)

**Home Preparation**

### Hip Precautions (Critical for First 6-12 Weeks)

These movements can cause hip dislocation until tissues heal:

**DO NOT:**
- Bend hip past 90 degrees (don't bring knee above hip)
- Cross operated leg over other leg
- Turn toes inward (internal rotation)
- Twist at the hip
- Sit on low chairs or toilets

**DO:**
- Keep legs apart (use pillow between legs in bed)
- Keep toes pointing forward or slightly outward
- Use raised toilet seat
- Sit in chairs with arms (help getting up)

- Keep incision clean and dry

**Weeks 2-6**
- Transition from walker to cane
- Increase walking distance
- Continue physical therapy
- May return to desk work (4-6 weeks)
- Follow-up appointment

**Weeks 6-12**
- Most hip precautions lifted
- Walk without assistive device
- Resume driving (when off narcotics and safe)
- Continue strengthening exercises

**3-6 Months**
- Return to most activities
- Continue improvement
- May resume low-impact sports

**1 Year**
- Maximum improvement reached
- Full activity without restrictions
- Annual check-ups recommended

## Long-Term Success

**Hip Replacement Success Rates**
- Over 95% of patients have significant pain relief
- Most artificial hips last 20-30 years
- Younger, more active patients may need revision sooner
- Regular follow-up monitors implant condition

# Knee Replacement Surgery

## Understanding the Knee Joint

The knee is the largest joint in the body:
- **Three bones**: Femur (thighbone), tibia (shinbone), patella (kneecap)
- **Cartilage**: Covers bone ends for smooth movement
- **Menisci**: Shock-absorbing cartilage pads
- **Ligaments**: Provide stability
- **Function**: Bending, straightening, some rotation

## Why Knee Replacement Is Needed

### Osteoarthritis (Most Common)
- Cartilage breaks down with age and use
- Bone-on-bone contact causes pain
- Joint becomes stiff and swollen
- Most common after age 50

### Other Conditions
- **Rheumatoid arthritis**: Inflammatory joint disease
- **Post-traumatic arthritis**: Following knee injury
- **Knee deformity**: Bowing in or out

### When Surgery Is Recommended
- Severe knee pain that limits daily activities
- Pain that continues at rest or disturbs sleep
- Chronic knee inflammation and swelling
- Knee deformity (bowing in or out)
- Failure to improve with other treatments

## Types of Knee Replacement

### Total Knee Replacement
- All three compartments resurfaced
- Most common type
- Best for widespread arthritis

### Partial Knee Replacement (Unicompartmental)
- Only damaged compartment replaced
- Preserves healthy bone and cartilage
- Smaller incision, faster recovery
- Suitable if damage limited to one area

### Bilateral Knee Replacement
- Both knees replaced
- Can be done same surgery or staged
- Longer single recovery vs. two separate recoveries

## The Artificial Knee

### Components
1. **Femoral component**: Covers end of thighbone (metal)
2. **Tibial component**: Covers top of shinbone (metal with plastic insert)
3. **Patellar component**: Resurfaces kneecap (plastic) - not always used

### Materials
- Cobalt-chromium alloys
- Titanium
- High-grade polyethylene (plastic)
- Designed to last 15-25+ years

## What to Expect

### Before Surgery

**Preparation**
