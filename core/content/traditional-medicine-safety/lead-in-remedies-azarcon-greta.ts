## What You Need to Know About Lead in Some Remedies

Some traditional remedies that families have used for a long time actually contain a very
dangerous poison called lead. Lead is a heavy metal that you cannot see, smell, or taste, but
it can seriously harm your health, especially children's health. Think of lead like an invisible
thief — it sneaks into your body and slowly causes damage without you knowing.

### Which Remedies Contain Lead?

The most well-known dangerous remedies are:

- **Azarcon** (also called rueda, coral, alarcon, or Maria Luisa) — a bright orange powder
  that can contain up to 95% lead. It is traditionally used for empacho (stomach blockage)
  and teething pain in babies.
- **Greta** (also called albayalde) — a yellow or white powder that can contain up to 90%
  lead. Also used for empacho and stomach problems.
- **Pay-loo-ah** — a bright orange powder from Southeast Asian traditions, similar in
  appearance and lead content to azarcon.
- **Some kohl/kajal eye cosmetics** — dark powder used around the eyes that may contain lead.

### Why Is Lead So Dangerous?

Lead is dangerous because your body cannot break it down or get rid of it easily. It builds
up over time, like trash piling up in a room with no door to take it out.

**For children, lead can:**
- Damage the brain and nervous system, leading to learning problems and lower IQ
- Slow growth and development
- Cause stomach pain, constipation, and loss of appetite
- Lead to anemia (not enough healthy red blood cells)
- At very high levels, cause seizures, coma, and even death

**For adults, lead can:**
- Cause high blood pressure and heart problems
- Damage kidneys
- Cause problems with pregnancy, including miscarriage
- Cause headaches, joint pain, and memory problems

### How to Protect Your Family

1. **Never use azarcon, greta, or any bright-colored powder as medicine.** These are not safe
   for anyone, especially babies and children.
2. **If your child has empacho**, talk to your doctor about safe treatments. Gentle abdominal
   massage and dietary changes are safe traditional options.
3. **Tell your doctor** if anyone in your family has ever used these remedies so they can
   test for lead.
4. **Spread the word** — many families do not know these remedies contain lead. Share this
   information with family and friends.
5. **If you have these products at home**, do not throw them in the regular trash. Contact your
   local health department for safe disposal instructions.

## Lo Que Necesita Saber Sobre el Plomo en Algunos Remedios

Algunos remedios tradicionales que las familias han usado por mucho tiempo en realidad
contienen un veneno muy peligroso llamado plomo. El plomo es un metal pesado que no se puede
ver, oler ni saborear, pero puede daniar seriamente su salud, especialmente la salud de los ninos.

### Cuales Remedios Contienen Plomo?

- **Azarcon** (tambien llamado rueda, coral, alarcon o Maria Luisa) — un polvo anaranjado brillante.
- **Greta** (tambien llamado albayalde) — un polvo amarillo o blanco.
- Ambos pueden contener hasta 90-95% de plomo.

### Como Proteger a Su Familia

1. Nunca use azarcon, greta, ni ningun polvo de colores brillantes como medicina.
2. Hable con su doctor sobre tratamientos seguros para el empacho.
3. Informe a su doctor si alguien en su familia ha usado estos remedios.

## Understanding Lead in Traditional Medicine

Lead contamination in traditional remedies is a serious public health issue that has been
documented by the CDC, FDA, and state health departments for decades. Unlike many health risks
that have been reduced over time, lead-containing traditional remedies continue to cause
poisoning cases in the United States and internationally.

### Products Known to Contain Lead

**Mexican/Latin American Traditional Remedies:**
- **Azarcon/Rueda/Coral/Alarcon/Maria Luisa**: Bright orange lead tetroxide powder (Pb3O4),
  containing 70-95% lead. Traditionally recommended for empacho in children.
- **Greta/Albayalde**: Lead monoxide (PbO) or lead carbonate (PbCO3), containing up to 90%
  lead. Yellow to white powder used for stomach ailments.

**South Asian Traditional Remedies:**
- **Pay-loo-ah**: Bright orange powder similar to azarcon, used in Hmong communities.
- **Some Ayurvedic medicines**: Studies have found that approximately 20% of Ayurvedic
  medicines manufactured in India and available in US stores contain detectable levels of
  lead, mercury, or arsenic (Saper et al., 2004).

**Traditional Cosmetics:**
- **Kohl/Surma/Kajal**: Traditional eye cosmetics that may contain up to 80% lead sulfide.
  Applied to children's eyes, creating both dermal and potential ingestion exposure.

### The Toxicology of Lead

Lead exerts its toxic effects through multiple mechanisms:

1. **Enzyme inhibition**: Lead inhibits delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) and
   ferrochelatase, two key enzymes in heme (hemoglobin) synthesis. This leads to anemia and
   the accumulation of toxic heme precursors.

2. **Calcium mimicry**: Lead substitutes for calcium in biological processes, disrupting:
   - Neurotransmitter release at synapses (causing neurological damage)
   - Bone formation and maintenance (lead is stored in bones for decades)
   - Cell signaling pathways throughout the body

3. **Oxidative stress**: Lead generates reactive oxygen species that damage cell membranes,
   DNA, and proteins throughout the body.

4. **Blood-brain barrier penetration**: Lead crosses the blood-brain barrier, particularly in
   children, causing direct neurotoxicity. Children's developing brains are especially
   vulnerable because of rapid neural growth and incomplete myelination.

### CDC Blood Lead Level Reference Values

| Blood Lead Level (mcg/dL) | Classification | Action Required |
|---------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| <3.5 | Below reference value | Routine monitoring |
| 3.5-9.9 | Elevated | Identify and eliminate source; follow-up testing |
| 10-19.9 | Elevated — increased risk | Source investigation; nutritional counseling; monitoring |
| 20-44.9 | Elevated — significant | Medical evaluation; environmental investigation |
| 45-69.9 | Elevated — urgent | Chelation therapy may be indicated |
| >=70 | Medical emergency | Immediate chelation; hospitalization |

### Why This Problem Persists

Several factors perpetuate the use of lead-containing remedies:
- **Cultural transmission**: Recipes and recommendations passed through generations
- **Trust**: Deep trust in traditional healers and family knowledge
- **Access barriers**: Language, cost, and immigration status barriers to medical care
- **Lack of awareness**: Many families genuinely do not know these products contain lead
- **Availability**: Products remain available at some border markets, botanicas, and through
  informal networks
- **Appearance of safety**: The products look like ordinary herbal powders

### What You Can Do

1. Learn to identify these products by name and appearance.
2. If your family uses traditional remedies, ask about the ingredients.
3. Get your children tested for lead, especially if they have been exposed.
4. Share this information in your community — knowledge saves lives.
5. Support community education programs that raise awareness while respecting cultural values.

## Advanced Toxicology of Lead-Containing Traditional Remedies

Lead-containing traditional remedies represent one of the most preventable causes of severe
heavy metal poisoning in pediatric and adult populations. Unlike environmental lead exposure
(e.g., lead paint, contaminated water), remedy-related exposure involves direct ingestion of
compounds with extraordinarily high lead concentrations, often administered to the most
vulnerable populations — infants and young children.

### Toxicokinetics of Ingested Lead Compounds

**Absorption**
- Gastrointestinal absorption of lead varies by compound solubility, particle size, and
  physiological factors.
- Lead tetroxide (azarcon) and lead monoxide (greta): 10-70% bioavailability depending on
  gastric pH, fasting state, and co-ingestion with food.
- Absorption is significantly increased in:
  - Children vs. adults (40-50% vs. 10-15% in adults)
  - Fasting individuals vs. fed state
  - Iron-deficient individuals (lead and iron compete for the same intestinal transporter, DMT1)
  - Calcium-deficient individuals (lead substitutes for calcium at absorption sites)

**Distribution**
- After absorption, lead distributes to three compartments:
  1. Blood (half-life: ~30 days) — measured by blood lead level (BLL)
  2. Soft tissues: liver, kidney, brain (half-life: ~40 days)
  3. Bone (half-life: 20-30 years) — lead substitutes for calcium in hydroxyapatite crystal
     lattice; bone serves as a long-term reservoir containing >90% of total body lead burden

- In children, a higher proportion of absorbed lead reaches the brain due to:
  - Incomplete blood-brain barrier maturation
  - Higher cerebral blood flow relative to body mass
  - Active neurodevelopmental processes that are disrupted by lead's calcium-mimetic effects

**Metabolism and Excretion**
- Lead is not metabolized — it is excreted unchanged, primarily through renal elimination.
- Renal clearance is slow (estimated total body half-life: years to decades when accounting
  for bone stores).
- During periods of physiological bone turnover (pregnancy, lactation, menopause, fracture
  healing), lead is remobilized from bone into blood, creating secondary exposure episodes
  long after the original exposure has ceased.

### Pathophysiology of Lead Toxicity

**Neurological Effects**
- Inhibition of NMDA receptor function, disrupting synaptic plasticity, long-term
  potentiation, and memory formation
- Disruption of dopaminergic, cholinergic, and GABAergic neurotransmission
- Interference with oligodendrocyte maturation and myelin synthesis
- Induction of astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema at high concentrations (encephalopathy)
- Apoptosis of neurons in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex
- Net effect in children: reduced IQ (estimated 1-5 IQ point loss per 10 mcg/dL increase in BLL),
  attention deficits, behavioral problems, learning disabilities

**Hematological Effects**
- Inhibition of ALAD: accumulation of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), which is itself
  neurotoxic and generates oxidative stress
- Inhibition of ferrochelatase: accumulation of zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), resulting in
  microcytic anemia
- Basophilic stippling of erythrocytes: aggregation of degraded RNA in red blood cells
  (pathognomonic but insensitive finding)

**Renal Effects**
- Acute: proximal tubular dysfunction (Fanconi-like syndrome)
- Chronic: progressive interstitial nephritis, eventually leading to chronic kidney disease
- Lead nephropathy is associated with hyperuricemia and "saturnine gout"

**Gastrointestinal Effects**
- Lead colic: severe abdominal cramping due to intestinal smooth muscle spasm
- Constipation, nausea, vomiting, anorexia
- "Lead line" (Burton's line): blue-black line at the gingival margin from lead sulfide
  deposition (present in chronic exposure with poor oral hygiene)

**Reproductive Effects**
- Males: reduced sperm count and motility, abnormal morphology
- Females: increased risk of spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, preterm birth
- Transplacental transfer: lead crosses the placenta freely, with fetal BLL approximately
  equal to maternal BLL

### Clinical Presentations by Exposure Scenario

**Acute high-dose exposure (typical of azarcon/greta ingestion in children):**
- Onset: hours to days after ingestion
- Presentation: severe abdominal pain, vomiting, encephalopathy (lethargy, irritability,
  seizures), anemia
- BLL: often >45 mcg/dL, may exceed 100 mcg/dL
- This is a medical emergency requiring immediate chelation therapy

**Chronic low-dose exposure (repeated use of contaminated remedies):**
- Onset: insidious, over weeks to months
- Presentation: nonspecific — fatigue, abdominal pain, constipation, developmental delays
  in children, cognitive decline in adults
- BLL: may be moderately elevated (10-40 mcg/dL) or may appear deceptively normal if
  exposure has ceased and lead has redistributed to bone
- Diagnosis often delayed due to nonspecific presentation

### Chelation Therapy Principles

| Agent | Route | Indication | Key Considerations |
|-------|-------|-----------|-------------------|
| Succimer (DMSA) | Oral | BLL 45-69 mcg/dL (symptomatic) | Preferred oral agent; can be used outpatient |
| CaNa2EDTA | IV | BLL >=70 mcg/dL or encephalopathy | Hospitalization required; monitor renal function |
| BAL (dimercaprol) | IM | BLL >=70 mcg/dL with encephalopathy | Used with CaNa2EDTA for severe cases; painful injection |
| D-penicillamine | Oral | Second-line; chronic management | Cross-reactivity with penicillin allergy; many side effects |

**Critical principle**: The source of exposure MUST be identified and eliminated before or
concurrent with chelation. Chelation without source removal is futile and may paradoxically
increase GI lead absorption.

## Comprehensive Clinical Management Framework

Lead poisoning from traditional remedies presents unique clinical challenges compared to
environmental lead exposure: the doses are often dramatically higher, the exposure is
intentional (though unintentionally harmful), and the cultural context requires sensitive
clinical communication to prevent ongoing exposure without alienating the family from
the healthcare system.

### Diagnostic Approach

**Initial Assessment**
When traditional remedy-related lead exposure is suspected:

1. **History**: Detailed traditional remedy use history (see curanderismo assessment protocol).
   Key questions:
   - What remedies have been given to the child? (Use specific names: azarcon, greta, etc.)
   - How much, how often, and for how long?
   - What was the indication? (Empacho, teething, colic?)
   - Where was the product obtained?
   - Are there other children or family members who have used the same product?
   - Has the child shown any symptoms? (Irritability, abdominal pain, constipation, lethargy)

2. **Physical Examination**:
   - Neurological: mental status, cranial nerves, motor tone, deep tendon reflexes
   - Abdominal: tenderness, distension, bowel sounds (lead colic vs. surgical abdomen)
   - Oral: gingival lead line (Burton's line) — present in chronic exposure
   - Growth parameters: plot on growth curves (lead exposure associated with growth failure)
   - Developmental assessment: age-appropriate milestones

3. **Laboratory Workup**:
   - **Venous blood lead level (BLL)**: The primary diagnostic test. Capillary (fingerstick)
     samples are acceptable for screening but must be confirmed with venous draw due to
     contamination risk.
   - **CBC with peripheral smear**: Microcytic anemia, basophilic stippling, reticulocyte count
   - **Iron studies**: Ferritin, serum iron, TIBC (iron deficiency increases lead absorption
     and must be corrected)
   - **BMP**: Renal function (BUN, creatinine), electrolytes
   - **Hepatic panel**: Transaminases (lead hepatotoxicity)
   - **Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) or zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP)**: Elevated in
     lead poisoning; useful for confirming chronic exposure but insensitive for acute exposure
   - **Urinalysis**: Glucosuria, aminoaciduria (proximal tubular dysfunction)
   - **Abdominal radiograph**: Radio-opaque material in the GI tract (lead compounds are
     radiopaque; if present, indicates recent ingestion and may require whole bowel irrigation)

### Treatment Algorithm

**BLL <3.5 mcg/dL**: No lead exposure detected. Reassure family. Routine monitoring if
ongoing risk factors present.

**BLL 3.5-9.9 mcg/dL**: Identify and eliminate exposure source. Nutritional counseling
(adequate iron, calcium, vitamin C). Retest BLL in 1-3 months. Developmental surveillance.

**BLL 10-19.9 mcg/dL**: All of the above, plus environmental investigation. Coordinate with
local health department for home visit and product identification/removal. Retest BLL in
1-3 months. Formal developmental assessment if concerns.

**BLL 20-44.9 mcg/dL**: All of the above, plus urgent environmental investigation and source
removal. Consider abdominal radiograph (if recent ingestion suspected). Consultation with
medical toxicology or pediatric environmental health specialty center. Retest BLL in
2-4 weeks. Comprehensive developmental evaluation.

**BLL 45-69.9 mcg/dL**: Medical emergency. Hospitalization for symptomatic patients.
Chelation therapy with succimer (DMSA) — oral, 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 5 days, then
10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 14 days. Confirm source elimination before discharge.
Abdominal radiograph; whole bowel irrigation if radiopaque material present.
Monitor BLL every 2 weeks during and after chelation. Rebound expected as lead redistributes
from bone.

**BLL >=70 mcg/dL or encephalopathy**: Life-threatening emergency. Immediate hospitalization,
preferably in PICU. Dual chelation: BAL (dimercaprol) 75 mg/m2 IM every 4 hours, PLUS
CaNa2EDTA 1500 mg/m2/day by continuous IV infusion (begin 4 hours after first BAL dose).
Manage cerebral edema (avoid lumbar puncture if elevated ICP suspected). Seizure precautions.
Monitor renal function daily. Transition to oral succimer when BLL <50 mcg/dL and patient
clinically stable.

### Long-Term Follow-Up Protocol

Lead poisoning from traditional remedies requires extended follow-up because:
- Bone lead stores will remobilize over months to years, causing BLL rebounds
- Neurodevelopmental effects may not manifest until school age
- Family may need ongoing support to avoid re-exposure

Recommended follow-up schedule:
- BLL monitoring: Monthly for 3 months after chelation, then every 3 months for 1 year,
  then every 6 months until stable and below reference value for 2 consecutive tests
- Developmental assessments: At 6 months, 12 months, and annually through school age
- Iron status: Correct deficiency aggressively (improves both anemia and reduces
  lead re-absorption)
- Educational support: Refer for early intervention services (Part C/Part B) if developmental
  delays identified
- Family support: Connect with community health workers; ensure family understands the risk
  without feeling blamed or shamed

### Cultural Communication Protocol

The discovery that a family has unknowingly poisoned their child with a traditional remedy
requires extraordinary sensitivity. The clinical team must:

1. **Avoid blame**: The family used these remedies out of love and cultural tradition. Frame
   the conversation around new information, not negligence.
2. **Validate the intent**: "I can see you care deeply about your child's health and were
   trying to help them feel better."
3. **Provide clear, factual information**: "This particular remedy, unfortunately, contains
   a metal called lead that can harm children. This is not widely known, and many families
   have used it without knowing."
4. **Offer alternatives**: "There are safe ways to treat empacho. Let's talk about those."
5. **Involve the family in the solution**: Empower the family to share this information
   with others in their community.
6. **Address fear**: Reassure regarding immigration status if relevant; mandatory reporting
   for child lead poisoning is a public health measure, not a punitive one.

## Population-Level Impact and Public Health Response

Lead-containing traditional remedies represent a persistent, preventable cause of severe lead
poisoning that disproportionately affects Latino and immigrant communities. Despite decades
of public health warnings, case reports continue to appear in the medical literature and
surveillance systems, indicating that current interventions have been insufficient to
eliminate this exposure pathway.

### Epidemiological Scope

**US Surveillance Data**
- CDC MMWR reports and state-level surveillance document ongoing cases of traditional
  remedy-related lead poisoning across multiple states, with clusters in California, Texas,
  Arizona, New Mexico, Illinois, and New York.
- Between 1993 and 2018, published case series document over 100 cases of severe lead
  poisoning (BLL >45 mcg/dL) attributed to azarcon, greta, and similar products in the US.
- True incidence is likely substantially higher due to:
  - Underreporting and underdiagnosis
  - Cases misattributed to environmental sources
  - Absence of systematic screening for traditional remedy use in lead-poisoned patients
  - Fear of authorities preventing families from seeking medical care

**International Context**
- In Mexico, studies have found azarcon and greta available in mercados and yerbarias in
  multiple states, with variable community awareness of lead content.
- WHO estimates that lead exposure accounts for 21.7 million disability-adjusted life years
  (DALYs) globally, with traditional remedy exposure contributing an unknown but significant
  proportion in low- and middle-income countries.
- Cross-border movement of people and products creates a continuous supply chain that domestic
  US regulation alone cannot address.

### Analysis of Intervention Failures

Despite longstanding awareness, several factors have limited the effectiveness of public
health interventions:

1. **Fragmented surveillance**: No dedicated national surveillance system tracks traditional
   remedy-related lead exposure as a distinct category. Cases are captured within general
   childhood lead poisoning surveillance, obscuring remedy-specific epidemiology.

2. **Regulatory limitations**: The FDA has issued multiple import alerts and safety warnings
   about azarcon and greta, but enforcement is limited by:
   - Products entering through informal channels (personal importation, border markets)
   - Domestic preparation from raw materials
   - Absence of a commercial distribution chain amenable to traditional regulatory intervention

3. **Culturally mismatched messaging**: Many public health campaigns have used fear-based
   messaging or implicitly demeaned traditional healing, reducing community receptivity and
   trust. Effective messaging must respect cultural values while clearly communicating risk.

4. **Healthcare system gaps**: Routine pediatric lead screening (recommended by AAP and CDC)
   does not consistently include questions about traditional remedy use. Providers may lack
   cultural knowledge to identify at-risk patients.

5. **Socioeconomic barriers**: Families most likely to use azarcon/greta are often those with
   the least access to healthcare — uninsured, undocumented, limited English proficiency,
   and living in areas with fewer healthcare providers.

### Evidence-Based Public Health Intervention Framework

**Primary Prevention (Preventing Exposure)**
- Community-based education campaigns co-designed with community members using CBPR methodology
- Promotor/a-delivered education in homes, churches, community centers, and WIC clinics
- Botanica/yerbaria owner education and voluntary product removal programs
- Social media and Spanish-language media campaigns with culturally resonant messaging
- Provider education to improve screening during well-child visits and prenatal care

**Secondary Prevention (Early Detection)**
- Universal blood lead screening at ages 1 and 2 (per AAP/CDC recommendation)
- Targeted screening with traditional remedy exposure questionnaire for at-risk populations
- Integration of traditional remedy use questions into EHR templates for medication reconciliation
- Laboratory partnerships to reduce turnaround time for BLL results in community health settings

**Tertiary Prevention (Reducing Harm After Exposure)**
- Standardized clinical protocols for managing traditional remedy-related lead poisoning
- Chelation therapy guidelines optimized for the typically high BLLs seen in remedy exposures
- Long-term developmental follow-up programs for lead-exposed children
- Family and community support services to prevent re-exposure and reduce stigma

### Policy Priorities

1. **Establish remedy-specific surveillance**: Create a reportable category within NHANES and
   state lead surveillance systems specifically for traditional remedy-related exposure.

2. **Bilateral cooperation with Mexico**: Coordinate regulatory and educational efforts with
   Mexico's COFEPRIS and Secretaria de Salud to reduce availability at the source.

3. **Mandate cultural competency training**: Require pediatric lead screening protocols to
   include culturally appropriate assessment of traditional remedy use.

4. **Fund community-level interventions**: Direct CDC childhood lead poisoning prevention
   program funding toward community-based interventions in disproportionately affected
   Latino communities.

5. **Research priorities**: Conduct population-based prevalence studies to quantify the
   contribution of traditional remedy exposure to the overall childhood lead burden in
   US Latino populations.

### Ethical Framework for Intervention

Public health responses to lead in traditional remedies must navigate complex ethical terrain:

- **Beneficence vs. autonomy**: The imperative to prevent poisoning must be balanced against
  respect for cultural practices and individual autonomy.
- **Non-stigmatization**: Interventions must avoid reinforcing stereotypes or demonizing
  traditional medicine broadly — the goal is eliminating specific dangerous products, not
  delegitimizing traditional healing.
- **Structural justice**: Addressing why families use dangerous remedies (healthcare access
  barriers, poverty, language isolation) is as important as addressing the remedies themselves.
- **Community empowerment**: The most effective and ethical interventions position communities
  as partners in the solution, not passive recipients of public health instruction.

## Impacto a Nivel Poblacional y Respuesta de Salud Publica

Los remedios tradicionales que contienen plomo representan una causa persistente y prevenible
de envenenamiento severo por plomo que afecta desproporcionadamente a las comunidades latinas
e inmigrantes.

### Marco Etico para la Intervencion

Las respuestas de salud publica deben navegar un terreno etico complejo: equilibrando la
prevencion del envenenamiento con el respeto a las practicas culturales, evitando la
estigmatizacion y abordando las barreras estructurales.
