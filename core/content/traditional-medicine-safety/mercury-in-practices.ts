## What Is Mercury and Why Is It Dangerous?

Mercury is a silvery liquid metal that you might have seen in old thermometers. In some
traditional practices, mercury (called "azogue" in Spanish) is used for spiritual purposes —
it might be carried in a pouch, sprinkled in the home, added to bath water, or placed in
candles or oil lamps. Some people believe it brings good luck, protection, or spiritual power.

However, mercury is one of the most dangerous metals known to science. Think of it like an
invisible poison gas: when mercury is left out in the open, it slowly turns into a vapor that
you breathe in without even knowing it. It is like secondhand smoke, except you cannot see
it or smell it.

### How Mercury Gets Into Your Body

- **Breathing it in** (most common and most dangerous): Mercury evaporates at room temperature.
  If you have mercury in your home — on the floor, in a container, or anywhere else — you
  and your family are breathing in mercury vapor every minute.
- **Through the skin**: Handling mercury with bare hands allows it to absorb through your skin.
- **Swallowing it**: Some practices involve ingesting small amounts of mercury, which is
  extremely dangerous.

### What Mercury Does to Your Body

Mercury is like a slow-acting poison that builds up over time:

**Brain and Nerves:**
- Memory problems and difficulty concentrating
- Mood changes — irritability, anxiety, and depression
- Trembling hands (tremors)
- Numbness and tingling in hands and feet
- In children: learning difficulties, developmental delays, and behavior problems

**Kidneys:**
- Mercury damages the kidneys, which are your body's filters. Over time, this can lead
  to kidney failure.

**Unborn Babies:**
- Mercury passes from a pregnant mother to her baby. It can cause brain damage, learning
  disabilities, and developmental problems in the child. This is one of the most serious
  risks of mercury exposure.

### How to Protect Your Family

1. **Do not use azogue in your home** for any purpose — spiritual or otherwise.
2. **If you have mercury in your home**, do not try to vacuum it or sweep it up — this
   spreads the vapor. Call your local health department or the EPA for safe cleanup guidance.
3. **Tell your doctor** if you or anyone in your family has been exposed to mercury.
4. **If you are pregnant**, mercury exposure is especially dangerous for your baby.
5. **Ventilate your home** if mercury has been used — open windows and doors.
6. **Wash hands thoroughly** if you have touched mercury.

## Que Es el Mercurio y Por Que Es Peligroso?

El mercurio es un metal liquido plateado que quizas haya visto en termometros antiguos.
En algunas practicas tradicionales, el mercurio (llamado "azogue") se usa con fines
espirituales. Sin embargo, el mercurio es uno de los metales mas peligrosos conocidos
por la ciencia.

### Como Proteger a Su Familia

1. No use azogue en su hogar para ningun proposito.
2. Si tiene mercurio en su hogar, no intente aspirarlo o barrerlo.
3. Diga a su doctor si usted o alguien de su familia ha estado expuesto al mercurio.
4. Si esta embarazada, la exposicion al mercurio es especialmente peligrosa para su bebe.

## Mercury in Traditional and Spiritual Practices

The use of elemental mercury (azogue) in spiritual and folk medicine practices has been
documented in multiple communities across the Americas, including Mexican, Caribbean,
Central American, and African diaspora traditions (such as Santeria and Voodoo). Mercury
is used for various spiritual purposes:

- **Carried in pouches or amulets** — believed to bring good luck and protection
- **Sprinkled on floors or in corners of rooms** — believed to ward off evil spirits
- **Added to baths or wash water** — for spiritual cleansing
- **Burned in candles or oil lamps** — as part of spiritual rituals
- **Placed under beds or in shoes** — for protection
- **Ingested in small amounts** (extremely dangerous) — believed to have healing properties

These practices create multiple routes of mercury exposure for everyone living in the
household, including children and visitors.

### How Mercury Affects the Body

Mercury is classified as a neurotoxin — a substance that poisons the nervous system. The
body handles mercury in a particularly dangerous way:

**Pathway of Harm:**
1. Mercury evaporates at room temperature, releasing invisible vapor into the air.
2. When inhaled, approximately 80% of mercury vapor is absorbed through the lungs.
3. Mercury enters the bloodstream and travels throughout the body.
4. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in the brain and nervous system.
5. It is oxidized to ionic mercury (Hg2+) inside cells, where it binds to and damages
   proteins and enzymes.
6. It accumulates in the kidneys, liver, and brain.
7. It crosses the placenta in pregnant women, reaching the developing fetus.

**The Clinical Syndrome: Erethism and Beyond**
Chronic mercury vapor exposure produces a characteristic clinical syndrome called "erethism":
- Personality changes (irritability, social withdrawal, depression)
- Insomnia and excessive fatigue
- Memory impairment
- Tremor (starting in fingers, progressing to arms and legs)
- Gingivitis and metallic taste in the mouth
- Excessive salivation
- Peripheral neuropathy (numbness, tingling, weakness in extremities)

At higher exposure levels, more severe effects occur:
- Renal dysfunction (proteinuria, renal failure)
- Immune system disruption (autoimmune-like responses)
- Thyroid dysfunction
- Cardiovascular effects (hypertension)

### Environmental Contamination

Mercury used in the home creates lasting environmental contamination:

- **Mercury droplets**: When spilled, mercury breaks into tiny beads that roll into cracks,
  carpets, and crevices. These beads continuously release vapor.
- **Carpet contamination**: Mercury trapped in carpet fibers cannot be removed by normal
  vacuuming and may actually be spread further.
- **HVAC contamination**: Mercury vapor can be distributed through heating and air
  conditioning systems throughout a building.
- **Persistence**: Without professional remediation, mercury contamination can persist
  for years, exposing residents to chronic low-level vapor.

### Testing and Treatment

**Testing for mercury exposure:**
- Urine mercury level: The standard screening test. Levels >20 mcg/L indicate significant
  exposure.
- Blood mercury level: Useful for recent acute exposure.
- Hair analysis: Can indicate chronic exposure over months.

**Environmental testing:**
- Air monitoring: Mercury vapor concentration should be below 1 mcg/m3 in residential settings.
- Professional environmental assessment can identify contaminated areas.

**Treatment:**
- Remove from exposure (most important step)
- For symptomatic cases: chelation therapy with DMSA (succimer) may be considered
- Most neurological symptoms are slowly reversible after exposure cessation, but some
  damage (particularly in children and fetuses) may be permanent

### Prevention

- Do not use azogue for any purpose — spiritual or otherwise.
- If mercury has been used in your home, seek professional environmental assessment.
- Educate community members about safe alternatives to mercury in spiritual practices.
- Healthcare providers should routinely screen for mercury use in at-risk populations.

## Mercury Speciation and Toxicokinetics

Understanding mercury toxicology in the context of traditional practices requires attention
to mercury speciation — the chemical form of mercury determines its absorption, distribution,
and toxic effects.

### Mercury Forms and Their Relevance

**Elemental Mercury (Hg0)** — The form used in traditional practices
- Physical state: Liquid metal at room temperature; vapor pressure 0.0012 mmHg at 20C
- Volatility: Saturated air concentration at 20C (~14 mg/m3) is approximately 200 times
  the occupational exposure limit
- Absorption: ~80% of inhaled vapor absorbed across alveolar membranes; <0.01% absorbed
  from GI tract (liquid); moderate dermal absorption

**Inorganic Mercury (Hg2+)** — Formed by oxidation of Hg0 in vivo
- The primary toxic species: formed when elemental mercury is oxidized by catalase in tissues
- Binds to sulfhydryl groups on proteins and enzymes, disrupting cellular function
- Primary target organs: kidney (proximal tubule cells), CNS (astrocytes and neurons)
- Poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier in ionic form, but Hg0 that has already
  crossed the BBB is trapped as Hg2+ after oxidation

**Organic Mercury (Methylmercury)** — Not typically involved in traditional practice exposure
- Primarily a dietary exposure (contaminated fish)
- Different toxicokinetic profile from elemental mercury

### Toxicokinetic Model for Elemental Mercury

**Absorption:**
Inhalation is the primary exposure route in traditional practice contexts:
- Alveolar absorption rate: ~80% of inhaled dose
- Mercury vapor is lipophilic, crossing alveolar membranes by passive diffusion
- Peak blood levels within hours of exposure onset
- Continuous exposure from household contamination produces steady-state body burden

**Distribution:**
- Blood half-life: ~60 days for elemental mercury
- Lipophilic Hg0 crosses the blood-brain barrier readily
- In the CNS, Hg0 is oxidized to Hg2+ by catalase; ionic mercury is then trapped in
  neural tissue
- Significant accumulation in kidneys (primary excretory organ)
- Mercury crosses the placenta; fetal brain concentrations can exceed maternal levels

**Metabolism:**
- Hg0 oxidized to Hg2+ by catalase in red blood cells, liver, and brain
- Hg2+ forms complexes with glutathione, cysteine, and other sulfhydryl-containing molecules
- These complexes are the ultimate toxic species, interfering with enzyme function

**Excretion:**
- Primarily renal (as Hg2+ conjugates)
- Some fecal excretion
- Exhaled vapor (minor pathway)
- Half-life: 40-60 days in blood; much longer in CNS tissue

### Pathophysiology of Mercury Neurotoxicity

Mercury's neurotoxic effects operate through multiple molecular mechanisms:

1. **Sulfhydryl binding**: Hg2+ has extraordinary affinity for -SH groups, disrupting
   thousands of enzymes and structural proteins. Selenium-containing enzymes (selenoenzymes)
   are particularly vulnerable, including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase.

2. **Oxidative stress**: Mercury depletes intracellular glutathione (the primary endogenous
   antioxidant), while simultaneously generating reactive oxygen species through disruption
   of mitochondrial electron transport.

3. **Calcium homeostasis disruption**: Mercury interferes with intracellular calcium signaling,
   leading to excitotoxicity in neurons and disrupted neurotransmitter release.

4. **Autoimmune activation**: Mercury can trigger autoimmune responses, including production
   of anti-nucleolar antibodies. This is genetically influenced (HLA-linked susceptibility).

5. **Demyelination**: Chronic mercury exposure damages oligodendrocytes and disrupts myelin
   maintenance, contributing to the peripheral neuropathy and CNS dysfunction seen in chronic
   poisoning.

### Environmental Assessment and Remediation

**Assessment Protocol for Mercury-Contaminated Residences:**

1. **Initial survey**: Visual inspection for visible mercury droplets; history of mercury
   use in the home (location, amount, duration, method of use)
2. **Air monitoring**: Jerome or Lumex mercury vapor analyzers measure real-time air
   concentrations. EPA residential action level: 1 mcg/m3
3. **Surface screening**: XRF (X-ray fluorescence) analyzers can detect mercury
   contamination on surfaces, including inside carpets
4. **Risk characterization**: Based on air concentrations, exposure duration, and
   occupant vulnerability (children, pregnant women)

**Remediation Priorities:**
- Hard surfaces: Professional chemical treatment (sulfur-based products convert Hg0 to
  less volatile HgS)
- Carpets: Must be removed and disposed of as hazardous waste if contaminated
- HVAC systems: Professional cleaning and filter replacement
- Cracks and crevices: Mercury droplets in floor cracks require specialized extraction
- Post-remediation clearance: Air monitoring must confirm <1 mcg/m3 before reoccupancy

**Cost and Logistical Challenges:**
- Professional mercury remediation costs $10,000-$100,000+ depending on contamination extent
- Temporary relocation of residents may be necessary during remediation
- The families most affected are often least able to afford remediation
- State and federal assistance programs have limited capacity
- Cultural sensitivity required in intervention delivery

## Clinical Approach to Mercury Exposure from Spiritual Practices

Mercury exposure from traditional spiritual practices (azogue use) presents unique clinical
challenges: the exposure is typically chronic and low-level, the symptoms are insidious and
often attributed to other causes, the exposure source is not routinely queried in clinical
encounters, and cultural factors may make patients reluctant to disclose mercury use.

### Diagnostic Algorithm

**Step 1: Clinical Suspicion**
Consider mercury exposure in patients presenting with:
- Unexplained tremor, especially fine intentional tremor of the hands
- Personality or mood changes (irritability, social withdrawal, depression, anxiety)
- Insomnia with daytime fatigue
- Memory or concentration complaints
- Peripheral neuropathy (paresthesias, weakness)
- Unexplained proteinuria or renal dysfunction
- Gingivitis, metallic taste, or excessive salivation
- Any of the above in a patient from a cultural background where azogue use is common

**Step 2: Exposure History**
Elicit specific information using culturally appropriate language:
- "Have you or anyone in your home ever used azogue (mercury) for any purpose?"
- "Have you visited a curandero or spiritual advisor who may have used mercury?"
- "Have you purchased candles, baths, or spiritual products that contained a silver liquid?"
- "Is there or has there ever been mercury in your home?"
- "Do you carry any pouches or amulets that might contain a liquid metal?"

**Step 3: Biomarker Assessment**

| Test | Specimen | Indication | Interpretation |
|------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Urine mercury | Spot or 24-hr urine | Primary screening test | <20 mcg/L: normal; 20-50: elevated; >50: significant; >200: severe |
| Blood mercury | Whole blood | Acute/recent exposure | <10 mcg/L: normal; >50: concerning |
| Hair mercury | Hair sample | Chronic exposure history | >1 mcg/g suggests chronic exposure |
| Urine NAG | Spot urine | Renal tubular damage marker | Elevated indicates proximal tubular injury |
| Beta-2-microglobulin | Urine | Renal tubular damage marker | Elevated indicates tubular proteinuria |

**Step 4: Neurological Assessment**
- Detailed neurological examination: tremor assessment (postural, intentional, resting),
  peripheral nerve function (vibration sense, proprioception, reflexes), cerebellar function
- Neuropsychological testing if cognitive complaints present
- Consider nerve conduction studies if peripheral neuropathy suspected
- Brain MRI: may show cortical atrophy and cerebellar changes in severe chronic exposure

### Chelation Therapy Protocol

**Indications for Chelation:**
- Symptomatic patients with elevated urine mercury (>50 mcg/L)
- Asymptomatic patients with urine mercury >200 mcg/L
- Clinical judgment for intermediate cases based on symptoms and exposure duration

**Agent: DMSA (Succimer)**
- Dose: 10 mg/kg (or 350 mg/m2) orally every 8 hours for 5 days, then every 12 hours
  for 14 days
- Monitor: CBC, hepatic panel, renal function at baseline and during treatment
- Side effects: GI upset (most common), rash, transient elevation of transaminases,
  neutropenia (rare)
- Efficacy: Reduces body burden but cannot reverse established CNS damage
- Note: The source of mercury exposure MUST be identified and eliminated prior to or
  concurrent with chelation therapy

**Agent: DMPS (Unithiol)** — Available in some countries
- Alternative to DMSA with similar efficacy
- Can be administered IV or orally
- Less commonly used in the US

**Chelation Monitoring:**
- Urine mercury levels before, during, and after chelation
- Expect a rise in urine mercury during chelation (mobilization effect)
- Post-chelation urine mercury should be monitored at 2-4 week intervals to assess rebound
- Multiple courses may be necessary for significant body burdens

### Longitudinal Care Plan

Mercury exposure from traditional practices requires long-term follow-up:

**Immediate (0-4 weeks):**
- Biomarker assessment (urine mercury, renal function, neurological exam)
- Source identification and elimination
- Environmental assessment of residence
- Chelation if indicated
- Family/household member screening

**Short-term (1-6 months):**
- Repeat urine mercury every 4-8 weeks until stable and below 20 mcg/L
- Monitor renal function if initially abnormal
- Neuropsychological assessment if cognitive symptoms present
- Prenatal referral if patient is pregnant (high-risk obstetric follow-up)
- Developmental assessment for exposed children

**Long-term (6 months - years):**
- Annual urine mercury and renal function for patients with history of significant exposure
- Neurodevelopmental monitoring for children exposed in utero or early childhood
- Continued community education to prevent re-exposure

### Cultural Communication Considerations

Discussing mercury use requires extraordinary cultural sensitivity:
- Mercury use in spiritual practices is deeply embedded in cultural beliefs
- Patients may fear judgment, loss of cultural identity, or legal consequences
- Frame the conversation around health protection, not criticism of beliefs
- Offer to discuss safe alternatives with their spiritual advisor
- Connect with community health workers who understand the cultural context
- Assure confidentiality and supportive intent

## Population Health Impact of Mercury in Traditional Practices

The use of elemental mercury in traditional spiritual and folk medicine practices represents
an undercharacterized environmental health risk that affects specific cultural communities
in the United States. Unlike industrial mercury exposure — which is well-regulated and
monitored — mercury exposure from traditional practices occurs in private residential
settings, is driven by cultural beliefs, and is invisible to conventional environmental
health surveillance systems.

### Epidemiological Data

**Prevalence of Mercury Use**
- EPA-funded surveys of botanicas in New York, New Jersey, and Florida found that mercury
  was available for sale in a significant proportion of establishments (estimates range
  from 7-30% depending on the survey and region)
- Community-based surveys in Caribbean and Latino communities have reported azogue use
  rates of 3-10% in some populations
- The true prevalence is likely underestimated due to stigma and privacy around spiritual practices

**Documented Health Impact**
- Case reports in the medical literature document mercury poisoning from spiritual use,
  including pediatric cases with significant neurological sequelae
- Environmental assessments of residences where mercury was used for spiritual purposes
  have documented air concentrations exceeding EPA residential action levels by 10-100x
- One study found that 50% of buildings where mercury had been released for spiritual
  purposes had mercury vapor levels exceeding 1 mcg/m3 at follow-up assessment
- Fetal and neonatal mercury exposure from maternal household use is documented but poorly
  quantified at the population level

### Regulatory Framework Analysis

**EPA Authority**
- Mercury is regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and the Clean Air Act
- EPA established a residential mercury action level of 1 mcg/m3 for air concentration
- However, enforcement is primarily geared toward industrial and occupational settings
- Residential mercury contamination from cultural practices falls in a regulatory gray area:
  not industrial, not accidental (intentional use), but also not an "emergency release"

**State and Local Regulation**
- Several states (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut) have enacted specific legislation
  restricting the sale of elemental mercury, including sales at botanicas
- New York City has conducted targeted inspection campaigns at botanicas
- Enforcement is complicated by small business dynamics, cultural sensitivity considerations,
  and the distinction between mercury sold for spiritual vs. industrial purposes

**International Context**
- UNEP Minamata Convention on Mercury (2017): Global treaty to reduce mercury exposure,
  including provisions relevant to mercury in cultural practices
- The Convention encourages parties to "take measures to reduce or eliminate" mercury use
  in traditional or artisanal practices

### Surveillance System Recommendations

Current surveillance for mercury exposure from traditional practices is inadequate. A
comprehensive surveillance framework would include:

1. **Clinical surveillance**: Integration of mercury exposure screening questions into
   primary care and emergency department protocols for at-risk populations. Standardized
   reporting of mercury exposure cases to state poison control centers with cultural
   practice source designation.

2. **Environmental surveillance**: Systematic assessment of botanicas and spiritual supply
   stores for mercury sales. Air monitoring programs for residences in communities with
   known mercury use traditions.

3. **Product surveillance**: Testing of candles, spiritual baths, and other products sold
   at botanicas for mercury content. Many of these products are imported and may not
   disclose mercury content on labels.

4. **Biomonitoring**: Inclusion of mercury biomarker testing in population health surveys
   (NHANES) with oversampling of at-risk cultural communities. Development of community-
   based biomonitoring programs.

### Public Health Intervention Design

**Effective Interventions (Evidence-Based):**
- Promotor/a-led community education programs that provide culturally respectful information
  about mercury hazards while offering safe alternatives for spiritual practices
- Botanica owner education programs (successful in New York and New Jersey)
- Partnership with spiritual leaders and traditional healers to modify practices
- Free mercury testing for households that volunteer to be assessed

**Ineffective or Counterproductive Approaches:**
- Heavy-handed enforcement that drives mercury sales underground
- Messaging that dismisses or demonizes spiritual practices
- Reliance solely on provider-based education without community outreach
- Generic environmental health messaging not tailored to the cultural context

### Environmental Justice Analysis

Mercury exposure from traditional practices must be understood within an environmental
justice framework:
- Affected communities are predominantly low-income communities of color
- They face disproportionate environmental health risks from multiple sources
- Healthcare access barriers prevent timely diagnosis and treatment
- Housing quality issues may exacerbate mercury contamination persistence
- Cultural practices evolved in contexts where mercury hazards were unknown
- Remediation costs are prohibitive for most affected families
- The intersection of immigration status, poverty, and cultural practice creates
  compounding vulnerability

**Environmental justice demands that:**
- Public health responses address the root causes of vulnerability, not just the mercury exposure
- Remediation funding is accessible to affected families regardless of income or immigration status
- Community members are partners in designing and implementing interventions
- The cultural significance of spiritual practices is respected even as specific dangerous
  materials are targeted for elimination

## Impacto en la Salud Publica del Mercurio en Practicas Tradicionales

El uso de mercurio elemental en practicas espirituales y de medicina popular representa un
riesgo de salud ambiental poco caracterizado que afecta a comunidades culturales especificas
en Estados Unidos.

### Analisis de Justicia Ambiental

La exposicion al mercurio por practicas tradicionales debe entenderse dentro de un marco de
justicia ambiental: las comunidades afectadas son predominantemente comunidades de bajos
ingresos y de color que enfrentan riesgos desproporcionados.

      clinicalNotes: [
        'EPA residential mercury action level (1 mcg/m3) is frequently exceeded by 10-100x in homes where azogue has been used for spiritual purposes — this level of contamination requires professional remediation.',
        'Botanica-based mercury sales have been documented in multiple states; regulatory enforcement varies and is complicated by cultural sensitivity considerations and small business dynamics.',
        'The Minamata Convention on Mercury provides an international framework for addressing mercury in cultural practices, but implementation in the domestic traditional practice context remains limited.',
        'Community-based interventions using promotores de salud and botanica owner education have demonstrated greater effectiveness than enforcement-only approaches in reducing mercury availability and use.',
        'Environmental justice principles require that mercury remediation assistance be available to affected families regardless of income or immigration status — current programs have limited capacity.',
        'Surveillance systems for mercury exposure from traditional practices are fundamentally inadequate; integration of cultural practice exposure screening into clinical and environmental surveillance is a priority.',
