      summary: 'Gender dysphoria is the distress that can occur when someone\'s gender identity differs from their assigned sex, and it can be relieved through social and medical affirmation.',
      explanation: `Gender dysphoria is a clinical term for significant distress related to gender incongruence.

**Understanding Gender Dysphoria:**

*What It Is:*
- Significant distress from mismatch between gender identity and assigned sex
- Can involve body, social role, or both
- Intensity varies from person to person

*What It's Not:*
- NOT the same as being transgender
- NOT a mental illness (the distress is the diagnosis)
- NOT something everyone experiences the same way

**Types of Distress:**
- **Body dysphoria**: Discomfort with physical characteristics
- **Social dysphoria**: Distress from being seen/treated as wrong gender

**How It Can Be Helped:**

*Social Affirmation:*
- Using correct name and pronouns
- Dressing in affirming ways
- Social recognition of gender

*Medical Options:*
- Hormone therapy
- Surgery (for some people)
- Other procedures as desired

*Mental Health Support:*
- Therapy to cope with distress
- Support groups
- Family counseling

**Important Facts:**
- Relief of dysphoria improves mental health
- Not all transgender people have significant dysphoria
- Treatment should be individualized`,

      summary: 'Gender dysphoria is defined in DSM-5-TR as marked incongruence between experienced and assigned gender with associated clinically significant distress, while ICD-11 uses gender incongruence classification outside mental disorders.',
      explanation: `Gender dysphoria and gender incongruence are the current diagnostic terms with important distinctions.

**Diagnostic Classifications:**

*DSM-5-TR (2022):*
- Gender Dysphoria (F64.0 in adults, F64.2 in children)
- Criteria: Marked incongruence + clinically significant distress/impairment
- Duration: At least 6 months
- Specifiers: With/without disorder of sex development, post-transition

*ICD-11 (2022):*
- Gender Incongruence (HA60, HA61)
- Moved from mental disorders to sexual health chapter
- Emphasis on incongruence, not distress
- Represents depathologization

**Clinical Criteria (DSM-5-TR Adult):**

Two or more for 6+ months:
1. Incongruence between experienced gender and primary/secondary sex characteristics
2. Desire to be rid of sex characteristics
3. Desire for sex characteristics of experienced gender
4. Desire to be of experienced gender
5. Desire to be treated as experienced gender
6. Conviction of having feelings/reactions of experienced gender

Plus: Clinically significant distress or functional impairment

**Phenomenology:**
- Varies in intensity and focus
- May fluctuate over time
- Social vs. body dysphoria distinction
- Non-binary presentations recognized

**Treatment:**
- Individualized based on symptoms and goals
- Social transition
- Hormone therapy
- Surgical interventions
- Psychotherapy for coping
- Not all components needed by all patients

**Outcomes:**
- Treatment significantly reduces dysphoria
- Mental health improvements documented
- Quality of life improvements
- High satisfaction rates with gender-affirming care`,

      summary: 'Gender dysphoria (DSM-5-TR) and gender incongruence (ICD-11) represent current diagnostic frameworks, with clinical assessment focusing on phenomenology, functional impact, and treatment planning rather than gatekeeping.',
      explanation: `Understanding gender dysphoria requires familiarity with diagnostic criteria, phenomenology, and clinical approach.

**Diagnostic Framework Evolution:**

*Historical Context:*
- DSM-III (1980): Gender Identity Disorder - highly pathologizing
- DSM-IV (1994): GID refined
- DSM-5 (2013): Gender Dysphoria - focus shifted to distress
- ICD-11 (2022): Gender Incongruence - depathologized

*Current Distinctions:*
- DSM-5-TR: Gender dysphoria = incongruence + distress
- ICD-11: Gender incongruence = incongruence (distress not required)
- Both support treatment access
- ICD-11 represents more depathologized approach

**Clinical Assessment:**

*Components:*
- Gender history across development
- Current gender identity/expression
- Nature and intensity of dysphoria
- Areas of focus (body, social, both)
- Functional impact
- Co-occurring mental health
- Goals for treatment

*Assessment Approach:*
- Non-pathologizing, affirming stance
- Supportive, not gatekeeping
- Collaborative goal-setting
- Informed consent framework

**Phenomenology:**

*Body Dysphoria:*
- Primary characteristics (genitals)
- Secondary characteristics (breasts, voice, hair)
- Varies in intensity and focus
- May be specific to certain features

*Social Dysphoria:*
- Misgendering distress
- Role expectations
- Name/pronoun usage
- May be prominent even without body dysphoria

*Non-Binary Considerations:*
- May experience dysphoria differently
- Goals may not fit binary framework
- Partial interventions may be appropriate

**Differential Considerations:**
- Body dysmorphic disorder (distinct psychopathology)
- Other psychiatric conditions (assess separately)
- Medical conditions with gender-related concerns

**Treatment Planning:**
- Address dysphoria sources
- Social affirmation
- Medical options (individualized)
- Mental health support
- Ongoing monitoring`,

        { term: 'partial interventions', definition: 'Gender-affirming treatments tailored to specific goals rather than full binary transition' },
        { term: 'functional impairment', definition: 'Difficulty in daily life activities, work, relationships due to condition' },

      summary: 'Gender dysphoria assessment integrates DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 frameworks within affirming clinical practice, emphasizing comprehensive phenomenological assessment, treatment planning, and differentiation from other conditions while avoiding gatekeeping.',
      explanation: `Expert assessment of gender dysphoria requires integration of diagnostic knowledge, clinical skill, and affirming approach.

**Diagnostic Frameworks:**

*DSM-5-TR Gender Dysphoria:*
- Criteria specify incongruence + distress
- 6-month duration
- Specifiers: With DSD, post-transition
- Enables billing, justifies medical necessity
- Retains "disorder" framing (controversial)

*ICD-11 Gender Incongruence:*
- HA60: Gender Incongruence of Adolescence and Adulthood
- HA61: Gender Incongruence of Childhood
- In "Conditions Related to Sexual Health" chapter
- Does not require distress
- Represents depathologization effort

*Clinical Implications:*
- Both support treatment access
- Choice may depend on payer requirements
- ICD-11 preferred by many patients and providers
- Transition between systems ongoing

**Comprehensive Assessment:**

*Gender History:*
- Earliest awareness of gender
- Development across lifespan
- Expression history
- Social environment responses
- Previous interventions if any

*Current Presentation:*
- Identity (binary, non-binary, fluid)
- Expression
- Dysphoria phenomenology
- Intensity and fluctuation
- Specific targets (body, social)

*Psychosocial Assessment:*
- Mental health comorbidities (independent of gender)
- Substance use
- Trauma history
- Social support
- Resources and barriers

*Capacity Assessment:*
- Understanding of treatment options
- Appreciation of effects
- Reasoning about choices
- Ability to express preference

**Differential Considerations:**

*Body Dysmorphic Disorder:*
- Focused on perceived flaw
- Insight often limited
- Not identity-based
- Different treatment approach

*Other Conditions:*
- Psychotic disorders (rare, usually clearly distinct)
- Obsessional rumination
- ASD (co-occurrence, not exclusionary)
- Medical conditions (e.g., DSD)

*Key Distinctions:*
- Gender dysphoria: Consistent identity, distress is about incongruence
- BDD: Perceived defect, distress about specific feature
- Psychosis: Typically other symptoms present, not consistent

**Treatment Approach:**

*WPATH SOC 8 Principles:*
- Individualized care
- Shared decision-making
- Flexible pathways
- Support available (not required gatekeeping)

*Intervention Matching:*
- Address specific dysphoria targets
- Social transition
- Hormones (feminizing or masculinizing)
- Surgical options
- Other procedures (voice, hair removal)
- Psychological support

**Documentation:**
- Clinical rationale for diagnosis
- Phenomenological description
- Treatment goals and plan
- Informed consent discussion
- Ongoing assessment notes`,

      clinicalNotes: `**Assessment Pearls:**
- Use ICD-11 when possible for depathologized framing
- DSM-5-TR may be required for billing
- Assessment should be affirming and supportive
- Not gatekeeping but collaborative treatment planning
- Document phenomenology carefully
- Consider non-binary presentations
- Differentiate from BDD (different treatment)
- Co-occurring conditions don't preclude treatment
- ASD co-occurrence is common; not a contraindication
- Capacity assessment is standard informed consent, not extra barrier`,
