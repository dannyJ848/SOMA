      explanation: `The transplant evaluation determines if you are a good candidate for transplant.

**What Is the Transplant Evaluation?**

The transplant evaluation is like a comprehensive check-up to see if a transplant is the right choice for you. It involves many medical tests and meetings with different specialists.

**Why Is Evaluation Important?**

The transplant team needs to know:
- Is your body healthy enough for surgery?
- Will the new organ work well in your body?
- Can you take care of yourself after surgery?
- Do you have support from family or friends?

**What to Expect During Evaluation**

*Many Appointments*
- You will meet many members of the transplant team
- The process includes many medical tests
- It can take several weeks to months to complete
- After evaluation, the transplant committee decides if you can be placed on the waiting list

*The Transplant Team*
- Transplant surgeons
- Nephrologists or hepatologists (kidney or liver doctors)
- Transplant coordinators (nurses who guide you through the process)
- Social workers
- Dietitians
- Financial counselors

**Key Terms**
- **Transplant Evaluation**: Series of medical tests and appointments to determine if someone can safely receive a transplant
- **Transplant Team**: Group of healthcare professionals who work together to perform transplants and care for recipients
- **Waiting List**: Official list of people waiting for organ transplants, managed by UNOS
- **Candidate**: Person being evaluated for or awaiting a transplant
- **Transplant Coordinator**: Nurse who helps guide patients through the transplant process`,

      explanation: `The transplant evaluation is a comprehensive process involving multiple medical, surgical, and psychosocial assessments.

**Components of Transplant Evaluation**

*Medical Evaluation*
- Physical exam, blood tests, imaging studies
- Organ-specific testing based on which organ you need
- Laboratory tests check organ function and overall health

*Cardiac Evaluation*
- Stress test: monitors heart during exercise to check for heart disease
- Echocardiogram: ultrasound of the heart to check structure and function
- Ensures your heart is strong enough for surgery

*Psychosocial Evaluation*
- Assesses mental health and social support
- Evaluates understanding of transplant process
- Checks ability to follow treatment after transplant
- Assesses for substance abuse or psychiatric conditions

*Financial Counseling*
- Ensures coverage for transplant surgery
- Verifies coverage for anti-rejection medications
- Helps with insurance and financial planning

*Dental Evaluation*
- Identifies infections that could spread after transplant
- Important because immunosuppression increases infection risk

**What the Team Looks For**

*Red Flags That Need Treatment First*
- Active infection must be treated before listing
- Uncontrolled psychiatric conditions may require treatment
- Substance abuse requires documented treatment and abstinence
- Obesity may need to be addressed before transplant (target BMI <35 for most centers)
- Cancer history requires a cancer-free period (varies by type)

      explanation: `# Advanced Evaluation Considerations

## Frailty Assessment

**Why It Matters**
Frailty predicts mortality and graft loss independent of age. Frail patients have 2x higher mortality after transplant regardless of age.

**Measurement Tools**
- **Fried Criteria**: Unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, weak grip, slow walking, low activity
- **Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)**: Balance, gait speed, chair stands
- **Timed Up-and-Go Test**: Measures mobility

## Sarcopenia Assessment

**What Is It?**
Loss of muscle mass and strength associated with poor outcomes.

**How Measured**
- CT imaging of muscle areas
- DEXA scans for body composition
- Grip strength testing

**Clinical Impact**
- Sarcopenia on CT imaging correlates with worse outcomes independent of age
- Predicts longer hospital stays
- Associated with higher mortality

## Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET)

**What It Measures**
- VO2 Max: Maximum oxygen consumption during exercise
- Measures cardiovascular fitness objectively

**When Required**
- Mandatory for diabetics and those over age 50 for most transplants
- Helps assess surgical risk

**Interpretation**
- Lower VO2 Max = higher surgical risk
- Guides decision-making about transplant candidacy

## Cognitive Impairment Evaluation

**Screening Tools**
- **MoCA** (Montreal Cognitive Assessment): Screens for cognitive impairment
- **SLUMS** (Saint Louis University Mental Status): Alternative screening test

**Why Important**
- Identifies patients who may need support with medications
- Helps ensure adherence to complex regimens
- Predicts post-transplant outcomes

## Liver Elastography

**What It Measures**
Non-invasive test measuring liver stiffness to assess fibrosis.

**When Used**
- Kidney candidates with suspected liver disease
- Advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) may need simultaneous liver-kidney transplant

## Cardiac Testing Decisions

**Coronary Angiography Indications**
- Abnormal stress test
- High-risk diabetic candidates
- History of heart disease

**Sleep Apnea Screening**
- Untreated sleep apnea associated with cardiovascular events and atrial fibrillation post-transplant
- Should be identified and treated before transplantation

## Clinical Pearls

- Frail patients have 2x higher mortality after transplant regardless of age
- Cardiopulmonary stress testing is mandatory for diabetics and those over age 50 for most transplants
- Coronary angiography is indicated for abnormal stress test or high-risk diabetic candidates
- Untreated sleep apnea is associated with cardiovascular events and atrial fibrillation post-transplant
- Periodontal disease should be addressed to prevent post-transplant infections`,

      summary: 'Expert evaluation includes risk prediction models (KDPI, MELD, LAS), cardiac allograft vasculopathy assessment, multi-organ listing considerations, and management of highly sensitized patients.',
      explanation: `# Specialized Evaluation Protocols

## Risk Prediction Models

**KDPI (Kidney Donor Profile Index)**
- Score from 0-100% measuring donor quality
- Higher KDPI = lower expected kidney function
- Used for kidney allocation matching

**MELD (Model for End-Stage Liver Disease)**
- Score predicting mortality in liver disease
- Based on bilirubin, INR, creatinine
- Higher MELD = higher priority for liver transplant
- MELD-Na (including sodium) improves mortality prediction over MELD alone

**LAS (Lung Allocation Score)**
- Composite score for lung organ allocation
- Incorporates survival benefit and urgency
- LAS >50 indicates high perioperative mortality requiring careful selection

## Cardiac Allograft Vasculopathy Assessment

**Coronary Calcium Scoring**
- CT scan measuring calcium in heart arteries
- Assesses risk of heart disease

**Gene Expression Profiling**
- AlloMap test for heart transplant recipients
- Rules out rejection without biopsy
- Non-invasive monitoring

## Multi-Organ Listing Decisions

**Simultaneous Liver-Kidney (SLK) Listing**
Considerations include:
- Duration of renal failure
- Kidney biopsy findings
- MELD score
- Reversibility of kidney dysfunction in liver failure

**When to Transplant Both?**
- Liver failure with hepatorenal syndrome
- Metabolic diseases affecting both organs
- Polycystic kidney and liver disease

## Ventricular Assist Device Considerations

**VAD Complications**
May contraindicate heart transplantation:
- Infection
- Stroke
- Device malfunction
- Thrombosis

## Highly Sensitized Patients

**cPRA >99%**
- Very difficult to find compatible donor
- Longer wait times on standard list
- Special programs needed

**Desensitization Options**
- Plasmapheresis: removes antibodies
- IVIG: neutralizes antibodies
- Rituximab: destroys B cells
- Bortezomib: destroys plasma cells

**Paired Donation**
- Finds compatible donor
- Increases access for sensitized patients
- May require chain participation

**Priority Points**
- Highly sensitized patients get priority
- cPRA >98% gets additional points
- Reduces wait time disparity

## Transplant Tourism Considerations

**Infectious Disease Screening**
- Transplant tourism recipients need extensive infectious disease screening
- High infection risk from organs obtained in other countries
- Comprehensive testing required

## Clinical Pearls

- MELD-Na (including sodium) improves mortality prediction over MELD alone
- Lung candidates with LAS >50 have high perioperative mortality requiring careful selection
- Simultaneous liver-kidney listing considerations include renal failure duration, biopsy findings, and MELD score
- Ventricular assist device (VAD) complications may contraindicate heart transplantation
- Allo sensitization with cPRA >99% may require desensitization or incompatible transplantation
