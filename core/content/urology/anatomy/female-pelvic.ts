      summary: 'The female pelvic area contains the bladder, uterus, and support muscles that help control urination and support the organs.',
      explanation: `The female pelvis is the lower part of your belly that contains several important organs.

**Main Organs:**
- **Bladder**: Stores urine until you're ready to go to the bathroom
- **Uterus**: Where a baby grows during pregnancy
- **Vagina**: Birth canal that connects uterus to outside
- **Rectum**: Stores stool before bowel movements

**Support System:**
- **Pelvic floor muscles**: Like a hammock of muscles holding everything up
- **Urethra**: Short tube from bladder to outside (about 1.5 inches)

Women have a shorter urethra than men, which is why urinary tract infections are more common in women.`,
