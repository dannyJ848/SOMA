      summary: 'The male reproductive system includes the penis, testicles, and internal organs that work together to make and deliver sperm.',
      explanation: `The male reproductive system has parts you can see outside the body and parts inside.

**Outside Parts:**
- **Penis**: The organ used for urination and reproduction
- **Scrotum**: The skin pouch that holds the testicles
- **Testicles**: Two egg-shaped organs that make sperm and hormones

**Inside Parts:**
- **Epididymis**: A coiled tube where sperm mature
- **Vas deferens**: Tubes that carry sperm from testicles
- **Prostate**: A gland that makes fluid to help sperm

The testicles hang outside the body because sperm need to be slightly cooler than body temperature to develop properly.`,
