      summary: 'Activity monitoring is when devices track your movements and exercise to help you understand how active you are throughout the day.',
      explanation: 'Activity monitoring means using technology to keep track of how much you move and exercise. Devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches can tell when you are walking, running, biking, or even swimming. They count your steps and figure out how far you have moved and how long you were active. Some can even tell the difference between different activities, like recognizing when you are climbing stairs versus walking on flat ground. Activity monitoring helps you see patterns in how much you move, like which days you are most active or what time of day you exercise most. Many devices set daily goals for you, like walking 10,000 steps, and show you how close you are to reaching them. By tracking your activity over time, you can see if you are getting more active and staying healthy.',

      summary: 'Activity monitoring uses sensors and algorithms to detect, classify, and quantify physical movements, enabling objective measurement of exercise and daily activity patterns.',
      explanation: 'Activity monitoring systems employ multiple technologies to capture movement data. Accelerometers detect motion in multiple directions, forming the core sensing technology for most wearable devices. Gyroscopes measure rotational movement, improving activity type recognition. GPS tracks location and speed during outdoor activities. Heart rate sensors help distinguish activity intensity levels. Algorithms process raw sensor data to identify specific activities (walking, running, cycling, swimming), count steps, estimate distance traveled, and calculate energy expenditure. Activity classification uses machine learning trained on labeled movement patterns to recognize different exercise types. Advanced systems can detect sedentary behavior, counting prolonged sitting periods and prompting movement breaks. Data aggregation over time reveals patterns including daily activity levels, weekly trends, and progress toward goals. Activity monitoring serves multiple purposes: personal fitness motivation, clinical assessment of functional capacity, research data collection, and workplace wellness programs. Accuracy varies by device, activity type, and wearing position, with walking detection generally more reliable than other activities.',

      summary: 'Activity monitoring encompasses sensor-based movement detection, algorithmic activity recognition, and quantitative metrics enabling objective assessment of physical activity behaviors across various domains and populations.',
      explanation: 'Technical approaches to activity monitoring have evolved from simple pedometry to sophisticated multi-sensor systems with machine learning classification. Accelerometer-based systems analyze signal features (magnitude, frequency, patterns) to detect activities, with recognition accuracy depending on sensor placement, algorithm sophistication, and activity similarity. Research-grade accelerometers (ActiGraph, activPAL) provide validated metrics for physical activity research, while consumer devices offer accessibility with variable validation. Activity intensity classification typically uses metabolic equivalent (MET) thresholds or heart rate zones to categorize sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous activity, enabling assessment against physical activity guidelines. Sedentary behavior monitoring has emerged as distinct from physical activity tracking, recognizing that prolonged sitting poses health risks independent of exercise participation. Context-aware activity recognition incorporates additional signals (location, time, heart rate) to improve classification accuracy. Population-level activity monitoring through smartphones and wearables enables epidemiological research with unprecedented scale and temporal resolution, though selection bias and measurement heterogeneity present methodological challenges. Clinical applications include rehabilitation monitoring, fall detection, and functional capacity assessment, with research supporting activity monitoring in cardiac rehabilitation, pulmonary rehabilitation, and chronic disease management.',

      summary: 'Scholarly analysis of activity monitoring addresses measurement validation, behavioral intervention applications, methodological considerations in research and clinical use, and implications for precision health approaches.',
      explanation: 'Academic examination of activity monitoring spans measurement science, behavioral research, and clinical applications. Measurement validation studies assess device accuracy against criterion measures (direct observation, indirect calorimetry, doubly labeled water for energy expenditure), with systematic reviews revealing device-specific and context-specific accuracy variation. Methodological considerations for research use include wear time requirements, epoch length selection, non-wear detection algorithms, and data processing decisions affecting study outcomes. Behavioral intervention research examines activity monitoring as both outcome measure and intervention component, with evidence supporting modest activity increases when monitoring is combined with goal-setting and feedback, though sustainability remains challenging. Theoretical frameworks including Self-Determination Theory, Control Theory, and the Behavior Change Wheel inform understanding of monitoring mechanisms of action. Clinical measurement applications include objective functional assessment in rehabilitation, activity-based outcome measures for clinical trials, and longitudinal monitoring for chronic disease management. Precision health applications envision activity monitoring as component of comprehensive health assessment, with machine learning enabling prediction of health outcomes from movement patterns. Ethical and equity considerations address privacy of movement data, digital divide affecting monitoring access, and potential for surveillance through activity tracking. Emerging directions include passive smartphone sensing, environmental sensors, and integration with other health data streams.',

      summary: 'Clinical integration of activity monitoring requires appropriate patient selection, device recommendation, data interpretation, and evidence-based application within rehabilitation, chronic disease management, and health behavior counseling.',
      explanation: 'Healthcare applications of activity monitoring span assessment, intervention, and longitudinal management. Assessment applications use objective activity data to characterize baseline function, identify sedentary patterns, and establish personalized targets; research-grade devices may be appropriate for formal functional assessment while consumer devices suffice for behavioral monitoring. Prescription of physical activity benefits from objective baseline data, enabling specific recommendations (minutes of moderate activity, step targets) tailored to individual capacity and goals. Rehabilitation applications include monitoring exercise adherence, assessing functional recovery, and detecting activity pattern changes indicating clinical status changes. Chronic disease management leverages activity monitoring in diabetes (activity affects glucose), heart failure (activity tolerance as outcome), COPD (physical activity as prognostic indicator), and oncology (activity during treatment). Behavioral counseling integration involves reviewing activity data during visits, celebrating progress, problem-solving barriers, and adjusting goals based on observed patterns. Patient selection should consider motivation, technological capacity, and clinical appropriateness; not all patients benefit from or desire activity monitoring. Data interpretation requires understanding device limitations, contextualizing data within patient circumstances, and avoiding over-interpretation of day-to-day variation. Safety considerations include ensuring activity recommendations align with clinical status and addressing patients who may exercise excessively based on monitoring feedback.',

      clinicalNotes: 'Activity monitoring can objectively assess physical activity patterns, support behavioral counseling, and monitor functional status over time. Consider patient technological comfort and motivation when recommending monitoring. Use trend data rather than single days for clinical interpretation. Integrate activity goals with overall treatment plans, ensuring recommendations are safe and achievable. Address potential for monitoring to increase anxiety in some patients. For research or formal assessment, consider validated research-grade devices with appropriate protocols.',
