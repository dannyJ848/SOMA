      summary: 'Altitude illness happens when you go up a mountain too fast. The air has less oxygen higher up, which can make you feel sick. Going back down is the best treatment.',
      explanation: `## What Is Altitude Illness?

When you climb high into the mountains, the air gets thinner. There's less oxygen in each breath. Your body needs time to get used to this change.

If you go up too fast, you might get altitude illness. It's like your body saying, "I need time to adjust!"

## What Makes You Feel Sick?

- Less oxygen to breathe
- Your body works harder to get oxygen
- You might get dehydrated faster
- Sleeping can be harder

## Signs of Altitude Illness

**Mild Signs (Common):**
- Headache that won't go away
- Feeling tired and weak
- Upset stomach or throwing up
- Feeling dizzy
- Trouble sleeping

**Serious Signs (Get Help Fast!):**
- Confusion or acting strange
- Can't walk straight (like being drunk)
- Hard to breathe, even when resting
- Coughing with pink or frothy spit
- Chest feels tight
- Lips or skin look blue

**Remember: These Are Emergencies!**

## How to Stay Safe

**Climb Slowly:**
- Don't rush up the mountain
- Take breaks to rest
- Sleep a bit lower than you climb during the day

**Drink Water:**
- Drink lots of water
- Don't drink alcohol

**Eat Well:**
- Eat regular meals
- Bring snacks you like

**Watch Your Friends:**
- Tell someone if you feel bad
- Check on your friends
- Don't leave anyone alone if they're sick

## What To Do If Someone Feels Sick

**Mild Sickness:**
- Stop going up
- Rest at the same height
- Drink water
- Take medicine for headache (ask an adult)
- If no better in 24 hours, go down

**Serious Sickness:**
- GO DOWN right away!
- Even going down a little bit helps
- Call for help if you can
- Never leave someone alone

## The Golden Rule

**When in doubt, go down!**

Going down the mountain is the best treatment for altitude sickness. It can save a life.`,

      summary: 'Altitude illness ranges from mild AMS to life-threatening HACE and HAPE. Prevention through gradual ascent is essential. Recognition of early symptoms and willingness to descend are critical for safety. Treatment involves descent, oxygen, and medications.',
      explanation: `## Understanding Altitude Zones

| Zone | Elevation | Risk Level |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Intermediate | 5,000-8,000 ft | Low risk |
| High | 8,000-12,000 ft | AMS possible |
| Very High | 12,000-18,000 ft | AMS common, HACE/HAPE possible |
| Extreme | Above 18,000 ft | Severe risk, prolonged stay dangerous |

## Types of Altitude Illness

### Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)
The most common and mildest form.

**Required for diagnosis:**
- Headache (must have)
- Plus one or more:
  - Nausea or vomiting
  - Fatigue or weakness
  - Dizziness or lightheadedness
  - Difficulty sleeping

**Timing:** Usually starts 6-12 hours after arrival at altitude

### High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)
Swelling in the brain - a medical emergency!

**Warning signs:**
- Severe headache
- Confusion, acting strange
- Cannot walk straight (ataxia) - the "drunk walk" test
- Extreme tiredness
- May progress to coma and death

### High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)
Fluid in the lungs - also a medical emergency!

**Warning signs:**
- Very short of breath, even when resting
- Cough, possibly with pink/frothy sputum
- Chest tightness
- Blue lips or fingernails (cyanosis)
- Crackling sounds in lungs
- Rapid heart rate

**HAPE is the leading cause of death from altitude illness.**

## Prevention Strategies

### Gradual Ascent Rules
- Above 8,000 feet: Go up no more than 1,000 feet per day
- Take a rest day every 3,000 feet of climbing
- "Climb high, sleep low" - hike higher during day, sleep at lower altitude

### Hydration and Nutrition
- Drink 3-4 liters of water per day
- Eat regularly, even if not hungry
- Avoid alcohol for first 48 hours
- Avoid sedatives (they slow breathing)

### Medications for Prevention
- Acetazolamide (Diamox) helps prevent AMS
- Start 1 day before ascent
- Helps you breathe faster and adjust better

## Treatment Principles

### For Mild AMS
1. Stop going up (no higher ascent)
2. Rest at current altitude
3. Drink plenty of water
4. Take ibuprofen or acetaminophen for headache
5. Consider acetazolamide
6. If no better in 24 hours - descend

### For HACE or HAPE - EMERGENCY!
1. **Immediate descent** - most important treatment!
2. Go down at least 1,000-3,000 feet
3. Give oxygen if available
4. Consider descent medication (dexamethasone for HACE)
5. Use portable hyperbaric chamber if descent impossible
6. **Call for rescue immediately**

## Risk Assessment

### Higher Risk If:
- Previous altitude illness
- Living at sea level
- Rapid ascent (especially by plane)
- Hard exercise right after arrival
- Young adults (higher HACE risk)
- Genetic factors

### Lower Risk If:
- Already live at moderate altitude
- Take time to acclimatize
- Stay well hydrated
- Take preventive medications`,

      summary: 'Altitude illness encompasses a spectrum from benign AMS to life-threatening HACE and HAPE. Pathophysiology involves hypoxic stress, fluid shifts, and vascular changes. Lake Louise scoring aids diagnosis. Descent remains the definitive treatment, with pharmacological interventions as adjuncts.',
      explanation: `## Pathophysiology of Altitude Illness

### The Hypoxic Environment
At sea level: Atmospheric pressure = 760 mmHg, inspired PO2 ≈ 150 mmHg
At 3,000m (10,000 ft): Pressure ≈ 520 mmHg, inspired PO2 ≈ 100 mmHg
At 5,500m (18,000 ft): Pressure ≈ 380 mmHg, inspired PO2 ≈ 75 mmHg

### Body's Response to Hypoxia

**Immediate (minutes to hours):**
- Increased breathing (hypoxic ventilatory response)
- Increased heart rate and cardiac output
- Pulmonary vasoconstriction (problematic in HAPE)
- Sympathetic nervous system activation

**Acclimatization (days to weeks):**
- Increased 2,3-DPG shifts oxygen-hemoglobin curve right
- Increased red blood cell production (EPO stimulation)
- Increased capillary density in tissues
- Improved cellular oxygen utilization

## Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)

### Diagnosis: Lake Louise Score

**Self-Assessment (each symptom 0-3):**
- Headache
- Gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting)
- Fatigue/weakness
- Dizziness/lightheadedness
- Difficulty sleeping

**Diagnosis:** Headache (required) + total score ≥3

### Pathophysiology
- Mild cerebral edema (MRI shows brain swelling)
- Increased cerebral blood flow
- Possible blood-brain barrier changes
- Individual variability in hypoxic ventilatory response

### Risk Factors
- Rapid ascent rate
- Prior history of AMS
- Low altitude residence
- Exertion upon arrival
- Obesity (independent risk factor)
- Female gender (some studies)

## High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)

### Pathophysiology
- Vasogenic edema from BBB breakdown
- Increased intracranial pressure
- Cytotoxic edema component possible
- Autoregulation failure

### Clinical Features
- **Hallmark sign:** Ataxia (test with tandem gait)
- Altered mental status (confusion, drowsiness, inappropriate behavior)
- Severe headache unresponsive to treatment
- Can progress to coma in 24-72 hours untreated
- Cranial nerve palsies possible

### Diagnosis
AMS symptoms plus either:
1. Ataxia, OR
2. Altered mental status in setting of recent altitude gain

## High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)

### Pathophysiology
\`\`\`
Normal: Pulmonary arteries dilate with hypoxia
HAPE: Exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
  → Uneven vasoconstriction (some vessels constrict more)
  → Over-perfusion of unaffected areas
  → Capillary stress failure
  → Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema
  → Protein-rich fluid leaks into alveoli
\`\`\`

### Clinical Features
| Early Stage | Late Stage |
|-------------|------------|
| Decreased exercise tolerance | Dyspnea at rest |
| Dry cough | Productive cough (pink/frothy) |
| Mild tachycardia | Tachycardia, tachypnea |
| Crackles at lung bases | Diffuse crackles, cyanosis |
| SpO2 may be normal at rest | SpO2 <60% at rest |

### HAPE Risk Factors
- Prior HAPE episode (60% recurrence)
- Rapid ascent
- Heavy exertion
- Cold exposure
- Upper respiratory infection
- Genetic predisposition
- Certain anatomic variations

## Treatment Protocols

### AMS Treatment
1. Stop ascent
2. Rest at current altitude
3. Acetazolamide 250mg BID
4. Symptomatic treatment:
   - Ibuprofen 400-600mg q6h for headache
   - Ondansetron 4-8mg for nausea
5. If no improvement in 24h: descend
6. If worsening: immediate descent

### HACE Treatment
1. **Immediate descent** - minimum 1,000m (3,000 ft)
2. **Dexamethasone** 8mg IV/IM/PO initial, then 4mg q6h
3. Supplemental oxygen 2-4 L/min
4. Portable hyperbaric chamber (Gamow bag) if descent impossible
5. DO NOT leave patient alone

### HAPE Treatment
1. **Immediate descent** - definitive treatment
2. **Supplemental oxygen** - high flow if available
3. **Nifedipine** 30mg ER q12h (reduces pulmonary pressure)
4. Minimize exertion - carry if possible
5. Portable hyperbaric chamber
6. Avoid respiratory depressants

## Prevention

### Graded Ascent
- Above 3,000m: increase sleeping elevation ≤500m/day
- Rest day every 1,000m of gain
- "Climb high, sleep low" strategy

### Pharmacologic Prophylaxis

**Acetazolamide:**
- 125-250mg PO BID starting 1 day before ascent
- Continues through ascent and first 2 days at highest altitude
- Side effects: paresthesias, dysgeusia, polyuria
- Sulfa allergy contraindication

**Dexamethasone:**
- 4mg PO q12h (HACE prophylaxis)
- For HACE-prone individuals or acetazolamide intolerant
- Does not facilitate acclimatization - masks symptoms

**Nifedipine:**
- 30mg ER q12h (HAPE prophylaxis)
- For HAPE-prone individuals
- Monitor for hypotension`,

      explanation: `## Advanced Pathophysiology

### Oxygen Cascade at Altitude

\`\`\`
Sea Level → 5,500m (18,000 ft)
Inspired PO2: 150 mmHg → 75 mmHg
Alveolar PO2: 100 mmHg → 45-50 mmHg
Arterial PO2: 95 mmHg → 40-45 mmHg
SaO2: 97-98% → 70-85%
\`\`\`

### Individual Susceptibility Factors

\`\`\`
Uneven HPV + PA pressure >60 mmHg
  → Regional overcirculation
  → Capillary transmural pressure ↑
  → Mechanical disruption
  → Protein/erythrocyte leakage
  → Inflammatory amplification
\`\`\`

**HAPE Susceptibility:**
- Lower exhaled NO at baseline
- Reduced NO synthase activity
- Elevated endothelin-1
- Pulmonary artery hypertension at baseline

## Pharmacology in Depth

**Cautions:**
- Masks symptoms without treating hypoxia
- Rebound possible if stopped abruptly
- Does not aid acclimatization
- Side effects: hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression, psychosis

### Nifedipine

**Mechanism:**
- Calcium channel blocker

### PDE-5 Inhibitors (Emerging)

**Sildenafil/Tadalafil:**
- Increase NO-mediated vasodilation
- Reduce pulmonary artery pressure
- Alternative to nifedipine
- May be better tolerated

## Portable Hyperbaric Therapy

### Gamow Bag Physiology
- Increases pressure by ~2 psi (105 mmHg)
- Simulates descent of ~1,500-2,000m
- Improves SaO2 by ~3-10%
- Temporary effect - rebound after removal

**Protocol:**
- Inflate to 2 psi
- Patient inside zipped bag
- Continuous pumping (every 1-2 min) to flush CO2
- Treat for 1-2 hours
- Reassess after removal

**Indications:**
- HACE/HAPE when descent impossible or delayed
- Temporary stabilization pending evacuation
- Adjunct, not replacement for descent

## Prognostic Indicators

| Favorable Prognosis | Poor Prognosis |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Prompt descent | Delayed descent >12h |
| SpO2 improves with O2 | SpO2 refractory |
| Mental status improves | Progressing coma |
| HACE <6h duration | HACE >24h duration |
| Age <50 | Age >50 or comorbidities |

## Special Populations

### High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) Variants

- Pericytes (capillary coverage, BBB maintenance)
- Astrocyte end-feet (aquaporin-4 channels)
- Basement membrane (type IV collagen, laminin)

**Hypoxic Perturbation:**
1. Endothelial activation (VEGF, inflammation)
2. Tight junction redistribution
3. MMP-2/9 activation → basement membrane degradation

**Advanced Imaging:**
- High-field MRI: Splenium of corpus callosum
- DTI: White matter tract disruption
- SWI: Microhemorrhages
- MRS: Metabolic changes

### HAPE: Molecular Pathophysiology

**Endothelial Dysfunction:**
\`\`\`
Normal: Balanced NO, endothelin, prostacyclin
HAPE-susceptible: Reduced NO, elevated ET-1

Evidence:
  Lower exhaled NO at baseline
  Reduced NO metabolites
  Elevated ADMA (endogenous NOS inhibitor)
  eNOS polymorphisms (Glu298Asp, -786T>C)
  Asymmetric dimethylarginine elevation
\`\`\`

**Epithelial Injury:**
- Type II pneumocyte injury from edema
- Surfactant dysfunction (SP-B, SP-C)
- Impaired alveolar fluid clearance (ENaC dysfunction)
- Atelectasis, V/Q mismatch

**Genetic Associations:**
- eNOS variants (Glu298Asp, VNTR)
- HLA-DR6, HLA-DQ5
- ACE I/D polymorphism
- VEGF promoter variants

## Evidence-Based Therapeutics

### Acetazolamide: Current Evidence

**Meta-Analysis Data:**
- NNT ~4-5 for AMS prevention at high-risk ascent
- 125mg BID equally effective to 250mg BID
- Side effect reduction at lower dose
- Limited evidence for treatment (primarily prevention)

**Special Populations:**
- Pregnancy: Category C, generally considered safe
- Pediatrics: 2.5 mg/kg BID effective
- Renal impairment: Dose adjustment needed

### Dexamethasone: Nuanced Use

**Effectiveness:**
- RR 0.60 for AMS prevention
- Superior to acetazolamide for established HACE
- Does NOT facilitate acclimatization
- Symptom masking without addressing hypoxia

**Safety:**
- Glucose elevation (monitor in diabetics)
- Adrenal suppression with prolonged use
- Psychosis risk
- Rebound AMS/HACE if stopped abruptly

### Nifedipine vs. PDE-5 Inhibitors

| Agent | Evidence Base | Advantages | Considerations |
|-------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| Nifedipine 30mg ER | Established | Long experience | Hypotension, reflex tachycardia |
| Sildenafil 50mg TID | RCT data | Direct NO pathway | Headache common, TID dosing |
| Tadalafil 10mg BID | Growing evidence | QD/BID dosing | Longer half-life |

### Emerging Therapies

**Ibuprofen:**
- 600mg TID reduces AMS incidence
- NNT ~5-6
- Mechanism possibly central (prostaglandin-mediated)
- Alternative for sulfa-allergic patients

**Iron Supplementation:**
- Iron deficiency impairs HIF response
- May improve acclimatization
- Ongoing research

**Inhaled Beta-Agonists:**
- Salmeterol may reduce HAPE incidence
- Mechanism: alveolar fluid clearance upregulation
- Adjunct, not primary prevention

**Bosentan (ET Receptor Antagonist):**
- Reduces pulmonary hypertension
- Limited data, expensive
- Potential for HAPE prevention

## Special Populations

### Reentry HAPE
- High-altitude natives after lowland stay
- Pulmonary vascular remodeling reverses at low altitude
- Return triggers exaggerated HPV
- Consider graded reascent, nifedipine prophylaxis

### Chronic Mountain Sickness (Monge Disease)
- Excessive erythrocytosis (Hct >65% in men, >60% in women)
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Right heart failure risk
- Treatment: Descent or phlebotomy ± acetazolamide

### Pediatric Considerations
- Children may not articulate symptoms
- Behavioral changes may indicate AMS
- HAPE relatively more common than HACE
- Acetazolamide: 2.5 mg/kg BID

### Pregnancy at Altitude
- Increased risk of preeclampsia, IUGR
- Avoid travel >3,600m if possible
- Acetazolamide generally considered safe
- Gradual ascent essential

      clinicalNotes: `Clinical Pearls - Altitude Medicine:

1. Genetic testing may soon identify high-risk individuals before ascent
2. HACE imaging abnormalities may persist despite clinical recovery
3. Reentry HAPE under-recognized in highland populations
4. PDE-5 inhibitors reasonable alternative to nifedipine
5. Ibuprofen 600mg TID effective for AMS prevention
6. Iron status should be optimized before high-altitude travel
7. Pediatric AMS may present as behavioral changes
8. The combination of HACE+HAPE has especially high mortality
9. Consider HAPE in any child with respiratory distress at altitude
10. Dexamethasone without descent risks masking progression`,
