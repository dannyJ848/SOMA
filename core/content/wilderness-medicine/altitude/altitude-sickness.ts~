      summary: 'Altitude sickness happens when you go up high mountains too fast. Your body needs time to get used to having less oxygen in the air. Most people feel better by going back down or resting.',
      explanation: `## What Is Altitude Sickness?

When you climb high into the mountains, the air gets thinner. There's less oxygen to breathe. Your body needs time to adjust to this change.

If you go up too fast, you might get altitude sickness. It's like your body saying, "Slow down! I need time to get used to this!"

## Why Does It Happen?

- At high altitudes, there's less oxygen in every breath you take
- Your body has to work harder to get enough oxygen
- It takes a few days for your body to adjust
- Going up too quickly doesn't give your body enough time

## The Main Types

**Mild Mountain Sickness (AMS)**
- Headache that won't go away
- Feeling tired and weak
- Upset stomach
- Trouble sleeping

**Brain Swelling (HACE) - VERY SERIOUS**
- Confusion and acting strange
- Can't walk straight
- Getting very sleepy
- This is an emergency!

**Lung Problems (HAPE) - VERY SERIOUS**
- Very hard to breathe
- Coughing (sometimes pink frothy spit)
- Chest feels tight
- This is also an emergency!

## The Golden Rule

**When in doubt, go down!**

If someone gets confused, can't walk straight, or has serious breathing problems at high altitude, they MUST go down the mountain right away. This can save their life.

## How to Stay Safe

- Climb slowly - don't rush!
- Drink lots of water
- Tell adults if you feel sick
- Don't be afraid to turn back`,

      summary: 'Altitude sickness occurs when the body cannot adequately compensate for reduced oxygen at high elevations. It ranges from mild AMS with headache and nausea to life-threatening HACE and HAPE, which require immediate descent.',
      explanation: `## Understanding Altitude Sickness

As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, meaning there are fewer oxygen molecules in each breath. The body must adapt through a process called acclimatization.

## Altitude Classifications

| Zone | Altitude | Effects |
|------|----------|---------|
| High | 8,000-12,000 ft (2,500-3,500m) | AMS possible |
| Very High | 12,000-18,000 ft (3,500-5,500m) | AMS common |
| Extreme | >18,000 ft (>5,500m) | Prolonged exposure dangerous |

## Types of Altitude Illness

### Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)
The most common form, affecting 25-50% of people ascending rapidly above 8,000 feet.

**Symptoms (must include headache plus one or more):**
- Headache (most common)
- Nausea or vomiting
- Fatigue and weakness
- Dizziness
- Poor sleep

**Timeline:** Symptoms typically appear 6-12 hours after arrival at altitude.

### High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)
Brain swelling that can progress from severe AMS.

**Warning Signs:**
- Confusion and disorientation
- Ataxia (can't walk straight - the "drunk walk")
- Altered consciousness
- Severe headache unresponsive to medication

**Critical:** HACE can progress to coma and death within hours if untreated.

### High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)
Fluid accumulation in the lungs.

**Warning Signs:**
- Severe breathlessness at rest
- Productive cough (may be pink/frothy)
- Chest tightness
- Extreme fatigue
- Blue lips or fingernails

**Critical:** HAPE is the most common cause of altitude-related death.

## Risk Factors

- Rapid ascent (faster than 1,000 ft/day above 8,000 ft)
- Prior history of altitude illness
- Living at low elevation
- Exertion upon arrival
- Certain medical conditions
- Individual susceptibility (genetic factors)

## Prevention: The Climb High, Sleep Low Strategy

1. **Gradual ascent:** Above 8,000 ft, increase sleeping altitude by no more than 1,000 ft per day
2. **Rest days:** Take a rest day every 3,000 ft of elevation gain
3. **Hydration:** Drink 3-4 liters of water daily
4. **Avoid alcohol:** Especially in the first 48 hours
5. **Medications:** Acetazolamide can help prevent AMS

## Treatment Principles

1. **Stop ascending** if symptoms develop
2. **Descend** if symptoms worsen or don't improve in 24 hours
3. **Immediate descent** for any HACE or HAPE symptoms
4. **Supplemental oxygen** if available
5. **Medications** for symptom relief (ibuprofen for headache, ondansetron for nausea)

## The Critical Rule

**Descent is the definitive treatment.** Even 1,000-2,000 feet can provide significant relief. Never leave someone with HACE or HAPE alone, and never delay descent for any reason.`,

      summary: 'High altitude illness encompasses a spectrum from benign AMS to life-threatening HACE and HAPE. Pathophysiology involves hypoxic ventilatory responses, fluid shifts, and vascular changes. Prevention through graded ascent and pharmacological prophylaxis, combined with prompt recognition and descent, are key management principles.',
      explanation: `## Pathophysiology of High Altitude Illness

### The Hypoxic Environment

At sea level, atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg with an inspired PO2 of ~150 mmHg. At altitude:
- 3,000m (10,000 ft): Pressure drops to ~520 mmHg, inspired PO2 ~100 mmHg
- 5,500m (18,000 ft): Pressure ~380 mmHg, inspired PO2 ~75 mmHg
- 8,848m (Everest summit): Pressure ~250 mmHg, inspired PO2 ~50 mmHg

### Compensatory Mechanisms

**Immediate responses:**
- Increased ventilation (hypoxic ventilatory response)
- Increased heart rate and cardiac output
- Pulmonary vasoconstriction (problematic in HAPE)
- Fluid shifts and diuresis

**Acclimatization (days to weeks):**
- Increased 2,3-DPG shifts oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve right
- Erythropoietin stimulation increases red blood cell production
- Increased capillary density in tissues
- Improved cellular oxygen utilization

## Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)

### Diagnosis: Lake Louise Criteria

Self-reported symptoms in setting of recent altitude gain:
1. Headache (required) plus one or more of:
2. GI symptoms (nausea, vomiting, anorexia)
3. Fatigue/weakness
4. Dizziness/lightheadedness
5. Difficulty sleeping

**Scoring:**
- Each symptom rated 0-3 severity
- AMS diagnosis: headache + total score ≥3

### Pathophysiology
- Relative hypoventilation compared to ideal (may be genetic)
- Mild cerebral edema (MRI studies show brain swelling)
- Increased cerebral blood flow
- Possible blood-brain barrier permeability changes

## High Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE)

### Pathophysiology
- Progression of AMS pathophysiology
- Vasogenic edema from BBB breakdown
- Increased intracranial pressure
- Possible cytotoxic edema component

### Clinical Features
- **Ataxia:** The hallmark finding - test with tandem gait (heel-to-toe walking)
- **Altered mental status:** Confusion, drowsiness, inappropriate behavior
- **Progression:** Can evolve from AMS over hours to days
- **Untreated:** Coma and death within 24-72 hours

### Diagnosis
AMS symptoms plus either:
- Ataxia, OR
- Altered mental status

## High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE)

### Pathophysiology
- Exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
- Non-uniform vasoconstriction causes regional over-perfusion
- Capillary stress failure and leakage
- Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema
- Inflammatory component (but not primary mechanism)

### Risk Factors for HAPE
- Prior HAPE episode (60% recurrence risk)
- Rapid ascent rate
- Heavy exertion
- Cold exposure
- Upper respiratory infection
- Congenital absence of pulmonary artery (unilateral)

### Clinical Features
| Early | Late |
|-------|------|
| Decreased exercise tolerance | Dyspnea at rest |
| Dry cough | Productive cough (pink/frothy) |
| Mild tachycardia | Tachypnea, cyanosis |
| Crackles at bases | Diffuse crackles |

### Severity Grading
- **Mild:** Dyspnea with exertion, mild crackles
- **Moderate:** Dyspnea at rest, SpO2 60-80%
- **Severe:** Severe dyspnea, SpO2 <60%, central cyanosis

## Treatment Protocols

### AMS Treatment
1. Stop ascent, rest at current altitude
2. Symptomatic treatment:
   - Acetazolamide 250mg BID (speeds acclimatization)
   - Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for headache
   - Ondansetron for nausea
3. If no improvement in 24-48 hours: descend
4. If worsening: immediate descent

### HACE Treatment
1. **Immediate descent** - minimum 1,000m (3,000 ft)
2. **Supplemental oxygen** if available (2-4 L/min)
3. **Dexamethasone** 8mg initial, then 4mg q6h
4. **Portable hyperbaric chamber** if descent impossible

### HAPE Treatment
1. **Immediate descent** - most important intervention
2. **Supplemental oxygen** - high flow if available
3. **Minimize exertion** - carry patient if possible
4. **Nifedipine** 30mg extended-release q12h (reduces pulmonary pressure)
5. **Portable hyperbaric chamber** if available
6. **Avoid respiratory depressants**

## Prevention

### Graded Ascent Protocol
- Above 3,000m: increase sleeping altitude ≤500m/day
- Rest day every 1,000m of elevation gain
- "Climb high, sleep low" strategy

### Pharmacological Prophylaxis
- **Acetazolamide** 125-250mg BID starting 1 day before ascent
- **Dexamethasone** 2-4mg q6h (for HACE-prone individuals)
- **Nifedipine** 30mg ER q12h (for HAPE-prone individuals)`,

      summary: 'High altitude illness results from complex interactions between hypoxic stress, individual variability in hypoxic ventilatory response, and pathological vascular and cellular responses. HACE involves vasogenic edema with BBB disruption, while HAPE stems from uneven hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and capillary stress failure. Management integrates pharmacological interventions targeting specific pathophysiological mechanisms with the definitive treatment of descent.',
      explanation: `## Integrative Pathophysiology

### Oxygen Cascade at Altitude

The oxygen cascade from atmosphere to mitochondria is compromised at each step:

\`\`\`
Sea Level (PO2 mmHg)    →    5,500m/18,000ft
Inspired: 150           →    75
Alveolar: 100           →    45-50
Arterial: 95            →    40-45
Venous: 40              →    25-30
Mitochondrial: 1-3      →    0.5-1
\`\`\`

### Individual Susceptibility Factors

**Hypoxic Ventilatory Response (HVR):**
- Blunted HVR associated with increased AMS risk
- Genetic polymorphisms in oxygen-sensing pathways (HIF-1α, EPO, EPAS1)
- Tibetan populations show advantageous adaptations

**Fluid Handling:**
- Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) elevation with hypoxia
- Aldosterone changes
- Inappropriate fluid retention predisposes to AMS/HACE/HAPE

**Pulmonary Vascular Reactivity:**
- Exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) linked to HAPE
- Genetic determinants of pulmonary vascular endothelial function
- Reduced nitric oxide bioavailability in HAPE-susceptible individuals

## HACE: Detailed Mechanism

### Blood-Brain Barrier Disruption

1. **Hypoxia-induced changes:**
   - Increased VEGF expression
   - Tight junction protein alterations
   - Aquaporin-4 channel dysfunction

2. **Hemodynamic factors:**
   - Increased cerebral blood flow (loss of autoregulation)
   - Elevated cerebral capillary pressure
   - Mechanical stress on capillary walls

3. **Inflammatory cascade:**
   - Microglial activation
   - Cytokine release (IL-1β, TNF-α)
   - Complement activation

### Imaging Correlates
- MRI shows increased T2 signal in white matter (especially corpus callosum and splenium)
- FLAIR abnormalities correlate with clinical severity
- Microhemorrhages visible on susceptibility-weighted imaging

## HAPE: Detailed Mechanism

### The Uneven Vasoconstriction Model

1. **Regional heterogeneity:**
   - Some pulmonary vessels over-constrict
   - Other regions receive excessive blood flow
   - Over-perfused capillaries experience stress failure

2. **Capillary stress failure:**
   - Pulmonary artery pressures can exceed 60 mmHg
   - Capillary transmural pressure rises dramatically
   - Physical disruption of capillary-alveolar membrane

3. **Secondary inflammation:**
   - Protein-rich edema triggers inflammatory response
   - Alveolar macrophage activation
   - Cytokine release amplifies damage

### Contributing Factors

- **Reduced NO production:** Exhaled NO lower in HAPE-susceptible individuals
- **Elevated endothelin-1:** Potent vasoconstrictor elevated in HAPE
- **Sympathetic activation:** Cold, exercise, hypoxia increase catecholamines
- **Genetic factors:** Polymorphisms in HIF pathway, NO synthase genes

## Advanced Pharmacological Management

### Acetazolamide: Mechanism and Use

**Mechanism:**
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
- Causes metabolic acidosis (bicarbonaturia)
- Acidosis stimulates ventilation (mimics acclimatization)
- Also acts as mild diuretic

**Dosing:**
- Prevention: 125-250mg PO BID starting 24h before ascent
- Treatment: 250mg PO BID
- Continue until descent to lower altitude

**Side effects:** Paresthesias, dysgeusia, polyuria, contraindicated with sulfa allergy

### Dexamethasone: Mechanism and Use

**Mechanism:**
- Reduces vasogenic edema (stabilizes BBB)
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Reduces VEGF expression
- May improve HVR

**HACE dosing:**
- 8mg IV/IM/PO initial dose
- 4mg q6h thereafter
- Continue during descent

**Prophylaxis (select cases):** 4mg q12h

**Caution:** Masks symptoms without treating underlying hypoxia; risk of rebound if stopped without descent

### Nifedipine: Mechanism and Use

**Mechanism:**
- Calcium channel blocker
- Reduces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
- Lowers pulmonary artery pressure
- Does not improve oxygenation

**HAPE dosing:**
- 30mg extended-release q12h
- Alternative: 10mg IR q4h (risk of hypotension)

**Prophylaxis:** 30mg ER q12h for HAPE-prone individuals

### Emerging Therapies

- **Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors:** Sildenafil 50mg q8h, tadalafil 10mg q12h
- **Salmeterol:** Beta-agonist may reduce HAPE incidence
- **Ibuprofen:** Some evidence for AMS prevention

## Portable Hyperbaric Therapy

### Gamow Bag (and equivalents)

**Mechanism:**
- Increases ambient pressure by 2 psi (105 mmHg)
- Simulates descent of 1,500-2,000m
- Rapidly improves oxygenation

**Protocol:**
- Inflate to 2 psi
- Maintain for 1-2 hours
- Pump every 1-2 minutes to clear CO2
- Rebound common when removed; temporizing measure only

**Indications:**
- HACE or HAPE when descent impossible
- Nighttime stabilization pending morning evacuation
- Not a substitute for descent

## Prognostic Factors

| Factor | Better Prognosis | Worse Prognosis |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| Duration of symptoms | <24 hours | >48 hours |
| Mental status | Alert | Comatose |
| SpO2 on O2 | Improves | Refractory |
| Response to descent | Rapid improvement | Ongoing symptoms |
| Time to descent | Immediate | Delayed >6 hours |`,

      explanation: `## Molecular Mechanisms of Altitude Adaptation

### The HIF Pathway

**Oxygen Sensing:**
- Prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3) hydroxylate HIF-α in normoxia
- VHL protein recognizes hydroxylated HIF-α for proteasomal degradation
- Hypoxia inhibits PHDs, stabilizing HIF-α
- HIF-α dimerizes with HIF-β, translocates to nucleus
- HIF complex activates hundreds of hypoxia-responsive genes

**Key Target Genes:**
\`\`\`
Erythropoiesis: EPO, EPAS1 (HIF-2α)
Angiogenesis: VEGF, PDGF
Metabolism: GLUT1, PDK1, LDHA
Vascular tone: NOS, endothelin
Iron metabolism: Transferrin, ferritin
\`\`\`

### Population Genetics of High-Altitude Adaptation

**Tibetan Adaptations:**
- EPAS1 variant (from Denisovan introgression) - blunts erythropoietic response
- EGLN1 variants - altered oxygen sensing
- Result: Lower hemoglobin at altitude, reduced polycythemia risk

**Andean Adaptations:**
- Different genetic architecture
- Higher hemoglobin levels (polycythemia)
- Larger lung volumes, enhanced diffusing capacity

**Ethiopian Adaptations:**
- Independent evolution of altitude tolerance
- Unique polymorphisms in oxygen-sensing genes
- Maintained SaO2 at altitude

## HACE: Emerging Mechanisms

### Neurovascular Unit Dysfunction

The blood-brain barrier is a complex structure involving:
- Endothelial cells with tight junctions
- Pericytes (capillary coverage and BBB maintenance)
- Astrocyte end-feet (aquaporin-4 water channels)
- Basement membrane

**Hypoxic perturbation:**
1. Endothelial activation and increased transcytosis
2. Tight junction protein redistribution (claudins, occludin)
3. MMP activation and basement membrane degradation
4. Pericyte dysfunction and detachment
5. Astrocyte swelling and AQP4 dysfunction

### Inflammatory Cascade

Recent evidence suggests inflammation amplifies HACE:
- DAMPs released from stressed cells
- NLRP3 inflammasome activation
- Microglial polarization to pro-inflammatory phenotype
- Complement activation (C3a, C5a)
- Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)

### Neuroimaging Advances

**High-field MRI findings:**
- Preferential involvement of splenium of corpus callosum
- White matter microhemorrhages on SWI
- Restricted diffusion (cytotoxic edema component)
- DTI shows white matter tract disruption

**Resolution patterns:**
- Imaging abnormalities may persist months after clinical recovery
- Some individuals show permanent white matter changes
- Cognitive deficits may persist (processing speed, memory)

## HAPE: Molecular Pathophysiology

### Endothelial Dysfunction

**Nitric Oxide Pathway:**
- HAPE-susceptible individuals have:
  - Lower exhaled NO at baseline
  - Reduced NO production during hypoxia
  - Elevated asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA, NO synthase inhibitor)
  - Polymorphisms in eNOS gene

**Endothelin System:**
- Elevated ET-1 in HAPE
- Exaggerated ET-1 response to hypoxia
- Endothelin receptor polymorphisms

### Surfactant and Epithelial Injury

**Alveolar epithelium:**
- Type II pneumocyte injury from edema
- Surfactant dysfunction
- Impaired alveolar fluid clearance
- ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) dysfunction

### Resolution vs. Progression

**Favorable resolution:**
- Alveolar fluid clearance via ENaC
- Surfactant restoration
- Inflammatory resolution
- Complete recovery typical

**Progression risks:**
- Secondary bacterial infection
- ARDS-like picture
- Multi-organ dysfunction
- Delayed descent correlates with mortality

## Evidence-Based Management Updates

### Acetazolamide: Current Evidence

**Meta-analysis data:**
- RR 0.47 for AMS prevention (NNT ~4 for high-risk ascent)
- Effective dose as low as 62.5mg BID for some
- Comparable efficacy at 125mg vs 250mg BID
- Limited evidence for treatment (mostly prevention data)

### Dexamethasone: Nuanced Use

**Prevention:**
- RR 0.60 for AMS
- Useful when acetazolamide contraindicated
- Concerns: immunosuppression, glucose effects, rebound

**Treatment:**
- Standard of care for HACE
- May have role in severe AMS
- Critical to combine with descent (doesn't address hypoxia)

### Nifedipine vs. PDE-5 Inhibitors

| Agent | Mechanism | Evidence | Considerations |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| Nifedipine 30mg ER | CCB, reduces HPV | Established | Hypotension risk |
| Sildenafil 50mg | PDE-5I, increases NO | RCT evidence | Headache common |
| Tadalafil 10mg | PDE-5I, longer acting | Growing evidence | Once daily dosing |

### Emerging Therapies

**Iron and Hepcidin:**
- Iron deficiency may impair acclimatization
- Altitude increases hepcidin (iron absorption regulator)
- Iron supplementation trials ongoing

**Inflammation Modulators:**
- Ibuprofen 600mg TID shows promise for AMS prevention
- Mechanism may be central rather than peripheral anti-inflammatory

**Metabolic Interventions:**
- Ketone supplementation (theoretical oxygen-sparing)
- Mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants

## Special Populations

### High-Altitude Residents Returning After Lowland Stay

**Reentry HAPE:**
- Tibetan, Andean individuals returning after lowland residence
- Pulmonary vascular remodeling may reverse at low altitude
- Return to altitude triggers exaggerated HPV
- Prevention: graded reascent, consider nifedipine

### Chronic Mountain Sickness (Monge's Disease)

- Excessive erythrocytosis in long-term high-altitude residents
- Pathological polycythemia (Hct often >65%)
- Pulmonary hypertension, right heart failure
- Treatment: descent or acetazolamide

### Pediatric Considerations

- Children may not articulate symptoms
- Behavioral changes may indicate AMS
- HAPE relatively more common than HACE in children
- Medication dosing: acetazolamide 2.5mg/kg BID

## Decision Support: Evacuation Algorithm

\`\`\`
AMS with headache only → Rest, symptomatic treatment
AMS moderate (LLS 4-6) → Stop ascent, consider descent if no improvement 24h
AMS severe (LLS >6) → Prepare for descent
Any ataxia or confusion → HACE: Immediate descent, O2, dexamethasone
Dyspnea at rest + cough → HAPE: Immediate descent, O2, nifedipine
\`\`\`

## Future Directions

- Genetic testing for susceptibility (EPAS1, EGLN1 variants)
- Point-of-care biomarkers (copeptin, sST2, NGAL)
- Hypoxic preconditioning protocols
- Personalized ascent profiles based on genetic/physiological testing
- Novel pulmonary vasodilator combinations`,
