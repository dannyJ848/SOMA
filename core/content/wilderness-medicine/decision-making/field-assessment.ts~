      summary: 'When someone gets hurt in the wilderness, you need to check them in a careful order. First look for big problems like not breathing. Then check for other injuries. Keep watching them to see if they get better or worse.',
      explanation: `## How to Check an Injured Person

When someone gets hurt far from help, you need to figure out what is wrong so you can help them. Do this in steps so you do not miss anything important.

## Step 1: Is It Safe?

Before you help, make sure:
- You will not get hurt too
- There is no falling rock, traffic, or other danger
- You are not making things worse

## Step 2: The Big Three (Primary Survey)

Check these FIRST because they can kill someone quickly:

**A - Airway (Can they breathe?)**
- Is their mouth or throat blocked?
- Can air get in and out?

**B - Breathing (Are they breathing?)**
- Is their chest moving?
- Can you hear or feel breath?

**C - Circulation (Is blood flowing?)**
- Is there bad bleeding?
- Do they have a pulse?

If any of these are wrong, fix them RIGHT AWAY.

## Step 3: Look for Other Injuries (Secondary Survey)

Once the Big Three are okay, check:
- Head: Bumps, cuts, blood from ears
- Neck: Pain, tenderness
- Chest: Does it hurt to breathe?
- Belly: Is it soft or hard?
- Back: Any pain?
- Arms and legs: Can they move everything?

## Step 4: Keep Watching

After your first check, keep watching them:
- Are they getting better or worse?
- Check the Big Three again every few minutes
- Talk to them to see if they are thinking clearly

## What to Tell Rescuers

When help comes, tell them:
- What happened
- What injuries you found
- What you did to help
- Whether they are getting better or worse

## Remember

- Stay calm
- Do not move someone unless you have to
- Keep them warm
- Write down what you find`,

      summary: 'Wilderness patient assessment follows a systematic approach: scene safety, primary survey (ABCDEs), secondary survey (head-to-toe examination), and ongoing monitoring. Limited resources require adaptation of techniques and reliance on clinical findings rather than diagnostic equipment.',
      explanation: `## Systematic Wilderness Patient Assessment

### Scene Size-Up

Before approaching the patient:
- **Safety:** Is the scene safe for rescuers? Environmental hazards?
- **Mechanism:** What happened? High-energy vs. low-energy?
- **Patients:** How many are injured?
- **Resources:** What equipment and help do you have?

### Primary Survey: ABCDEs

The primary survey identifies and treats immediate life threats:

**A - Airway**
- Is the airway open?
- Any obstruction (blood, vomit, swelling, tongue)?
- Consider spinal precautions if trauma

**B - Breathing**
- Is the patient breathing?
- Rate: too fast (>20), too slow (<10)?
- Quality: deep, shallow, labored?
- Listen for abnormal sounds
- Look for chest injuries

**C - Circulation**
- Check pulse (radial or carotid)
- Rate: fast (>100) or slow (<60)?
- Control major bleeding
- Signs of shock: pale, sweaty, confused, rapid pulse

**D - Disability**
- Level of consciousness (AVPU scale)
- Pupil response
- Movement of all limbs
- Blood sugar if available

**E - Exposure/Environment**
- Remove clothing to examine
- Protect from heat loss
- Note environmental factors (hypothermia, heat illness)

### The AVPU Scale

Quick consciousness assessment:
- **A**lert: Awake and oriented
- **V**erbal: Responds to voice
- **P**ainful: Responds only to pain
- **U**nresponsive: No response

### Secondary Survey: Head-to-Toe

Only after primary survey is complete and patient stable:

**History (SAMPLE):**
- **S**igns and Symptoms
- **A**llergies
- **M**edications
- **P**ast medical history
- **L**ast oral intake
- **E**vents leading to injury

**Physical Examination:**
| Region | What to Check |
|--------|---------------|
| Head | Scalp wounds, skull deformity, blood from ears/nose |
| Eyes | Pupils, vision, eye movement |
| Face | Fractures, jaw alignment |
| Neck | Tenderness, deformity, trachea position |
| Chest | Symmetry, tenderness, breathing sounds |
| Abdomen | Tenderness, rigidity, distension |
| Pelvis | Stability (gentle compression) |
| Back | Tenderness, deformity (log roll if needed) |
| Extremities | Pulses, sensation, movement, deformity |

### Vital Signs in the Field

**What you can measure:**
- Pulse rate and quality
- Respiratory rate and effort
- Level of consciousness
- Skin color, temperature, moisture
- Capillary refill time

**Interpreting vitals:**
| Vital | Normal Adult | Concern |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Pulse | 60-100/min | >100 or <60 |
| Respirations | 12-20/min | >24 or <10 |
| AVPU | Alert | Not alert |
| Skin | Pink, warm, dry | Pale, cool, sweaty |
| Cap refill | <2 seconds | >2 seconds |

### Ongoing Assessment

**Frequency:**
- Critical patient: every 5 minutes
- Stable patient: every 15-30 minutes

**What to monitor:**
- Repeat primary survey
- Vital sign trends
- Mental status changes
- Response to treatment
- New complaints

### Documentation

Record your findings:
- Time of injury and assessments
- Mechanism of injury
- Physical findings
- Vital signs over time
- Treatments given
- Changes in condition

This information is crucial for handoff to EMS or hospital.

## Wilderness Adaptations

**Without equipment:**
- Use watch or counting for rates
- Feel pulses rather than use BP cuff
- Assess perfusion by skin signs and mental status
- Improvise cervical stabilization

**With limited help:**
- Prioritize life-threatening issues
- May need to treat and assess simultaneously
- One rescuer may need to do everything`,

      explanation: `## Comprehensive Field Assessment Protocol

### Scene Assessment Framework

**Safety considerations:**
- Environmental hazards (rockfall, avalanche, water, lightning)
- Patient access issues
- Rescuer safety equipment needs
- Bystander management

**Mechanism analysis:**
\`\`\`
High-energy mechanisms (assume serious injury):
- Falls >20 feet or 2-3x body height
- High-speed vehicle/bicycle crashes
- Diving injuries
- Climbing falls with significant ground impact
- Avalanche burial

Low-energy mechanisms (focused exam):
- Ground-level falls
- Twisting injuries
- Minor impacts
\`\`\`

### Primary Survey Details

**Airway assessment:**
- Look: mouth, tongue position, secretions
- Listen: snoring, gurgling, stridor
- Feel: air movement

**Airway interventions:**
- Jaw thrust (suspected spine injury)
- Head-tilt chin-lift (no spine concern)
- Clear obstructions manually
- Recovery position for unresponsive breathing patient

**Breathing assessment:**
- Rate and depth
- Work of breathing (accessory muscle use, retractions)
- Chest wall movement symmetry
- Auscultation if stethoscope available

**Breathing red flags:**
- Rate <8 or >28
- Asymmetric chest movement
- Paradoxical movement (flail)
- Decreasing level of consciousness

**Circulation assessment:**
- Pulse location, rate, quality
- Active hemorrhage identification
- Perfusion: skin color, temperature, moisture, cap refill
- Mental status as perfusion indicator

**Shock recognition:**
\`\`\`
Compensated shock:
- Tachycardia, anxiety
- Pale, cool, diaphoretic skin
- Normal mental status
- May have minimal symptoms

Decompensated shock:
- Altered mental status
- Hypotension (late sign)
- Rapid, thready pulse
- Mottled skin
- Decreased urine output
\`\`\`

**Disability:**
- GCS or AVPU
- Pupil size and reactivity
- Lateralizing signs (one side different)
- Motor/sensory gross exam

**Exposure:**
- Complete examination requires exposure
- Balance thoroughness with environmental protection
- Hypothermia prevention critical

### Secondary Survey: Systematic Approach

**SAMPLE History:**
| Component | Key Questions |
|-----------|---------------|
| Signs/Symptoms | Pain location, severity, quality, radiation |
| Allergies | Medications, foods, environmental |
| Medications | Current, recent, compliance |
| Past history | Chronic conditions, previous surgeries |
| Last intake | Food, water, relevance for surgery/altitude |
| Events | What led up to this? What happened exactly? |

**Physical Examination Technique:**

*Head:*
- Palpate entire scalp (wounds hidden by hair)
- Assess for Battle sign (mastoid ecchymosis)
- Raccoon eyes (periorbital ecchymosis)
- CSF leak (clear fluid from nose/ears)
- Pupil exam: PERRLA (Pupils Equal Round Reactive to Light and Accommodation)

*Cervical Spine:*
- Midline tenderness
- Step-off deformity
- Muscle spasm
- Neurological symptoms

*Chest:*
- Visual: symmetry, wounds, paradoxical motion
- Palpation: tenderness, crepitus, instability
- Auscultation: breath sounds present and equal
- Consider: pneumothorax, hemothorax, rib fractures

*Abdomen:*
- Visual: distension, bruising, wounds
- Auscultation: bowel sounds (presence/absence)
- Palpation: tenderness, guarding, rigidity
- Percussion: tympany vs. dullness
- Consider: solid organ injury, hollow viscus injury

*Pelvis:*
- Single gentle compression test
- Do not rock repeatedly if unstable
- Note: pelvic instability suggests significant hemorrhage

*Extremities:*
- Deformity, swelling, bruising
- Pulses distal to injuries
- Sensation and motor function
- Compare side to side

*Back (log roll if indicated):*
- Spinal tenderness
- Wounds
- Deformity

### Vital Sign Interpretation

**Trending is more important than single values:**

| Trend | Significance |
|-------|-------------|
| Rising pulse | Compensation, pain, hypovolemia |
| Falling pulse | Late decompensation, head injury |
| Rising RR | Respiratory compromise, metabolic acidosis |
| Falling RR | Fatigue, head injury, impending arrest |
| Declining mental status | Hypoxia, head injury, shock |

**Pulse pressure:**
- Normal: ~40 mmHg (if BP measurable)
- Narrowing suggests hypovolemia
- Widening suggests head injury (Cushing response)

### Neurological Assessment

**Glasgow Coma Scale:**
\`\`\`
Eye Opening: 4-Spontaneous, 3-To voice, 2-To pain, 1-None
Verbal: 5-Oriented, 4-Confused, 3-Inappropriate, 2-Incomprehensible, 1-None
Motor: 6-Obeys commands, 5-Localizes pain, 4-Withdraws, 3-Flexion, 2-Extension, 1-None
Total: 3-15 (8 or less generally requires airway management)
\`\`\`

**Focused neuro exam:**
- Cranial nerves: pupils, facial symmetry, gag
- Motor: strength all extremities (5-point scale)
- Sensory: gross sensation
- Cerebellar: finger-nose, heel-shin if able

      explanation: `## Advanced Field Assessment Principles

### Physiological Assessment Framework

**Compensatory reserve:**
- Young healthy patients compensate effectively
- May maintain BP until 30% blood loss
- Tachycardia is early, sensitive, nonspecific
- Mental status change often precedes BP drop
- Assess patient trajectory, not snapshot

**Shock index (SI):**
\`\`\`
SI = Heart Rate / Systolic BP
Normal: 0.5-0.7
Elevated (>0.9): Associated with need for intervention
Highly elevated (>1.4): High mortality risk
Note: Requires BP measurement capability
\`\`\`

**Lactate approximation (without labs):**
Clinical indicators of tissue hypoperfusion:
- Altered mental status
- Mottled skin
- Delayed capillary refill (>3 seconds)
- Weak pulses
- Oliguria if observable
- Cold extremities

### Primary Survey: Advanced Concepts

**Airway management decision tree:**
\`\`\`
Breathing spontaneously?
  NO -> Reposition airway, BVM if available
  YES -> Airway patent?
         NO -> Jaw thrust/chin lift, suction, positioning
         YES -> Maintaining airway?
                NO -> Consider supraglottic airway if trained
                YES -> Monitor closely
\`\`\`

**Breathing: clinical pulmonary assessment:**

*Tension pneumothorax recognition:*
- Respiratory distress
- Hypotension
- Distended neck veins (may be absent if hypovolemic)
- Tracheal deviation (late sign)
- Absent breath sounds unilaterally
- Field treatment: needle decompression

*Flail chest:*
- Paradoxical chest wall movement
- Usually requires multiple rib fractures
- Underlying pulmonary contusion common
- May benefit from positioning injured side down
- Splint with pillow if available

**Circulation: hemorrhage assessment:**

*Blood loss estimation:*
| Class | Blood Loss | Heart Rate | BP | Mental Status |
|-------|------------|------------|-----|---------------|
| I | <15% (<750ml) | Normal | Normal | Normal |
| II | 15-30% (750-1500ml) | >100 | Normal | Anxious |
| III | 30-40% (1500-2000ml) | >120 | Decreased | Confused |
| IV | >40% (>2000ml) | >140 | Very low | Lethargic |

*Hemorrhage control priority:*
1. Direct pressure and wound packing
2. Tourniquet for extremity hemorrhage
3. Pelvic binder for unstable pelvis
4. Consider junctional hemorrhage (axilla, groin, neck)

### Secondary Survey: Clinical Reasoning

**Mechanism-based injury prediction:**

\`\`\`
Fall from height:
- Axial load injuries (calcaneus, spine, pelvic ring)
- Wrists (outstretched hands)
- Head injury possible
- Assess for associated cardiac contusion

Bicycle crash over handlebars:
- Abdominal injury (handlebar to abdomen)
- Head/facial trauma
- Clavicle fracture
- Upper extremity injury

Climbing fall with rope catch:
- Harness injury pattern (rib, pelvis)
- Flexion-distraction spine injury
- Whiplash-type cervical injury
\`\`\`

**Abdominal examination refinement:**

*Peritoneal signs:*
- Involuntary guarding (true rigidity)
- Rebound tenderness
- Pain with cough/movement
- Absent bowel sounds
- Progression suggests hollow viscus perforation or expanding hematoma

*Solid organ injury patterns:*
- LUQ pain, left shoulder pain (Kehrs sign): Splenic injury
- RUQ pain, right shoulder pain: Liver injury
- Flank pain, hematuria: Renal injury

**Neurological assessment depth:**

*Spinal cord injury assessment:*
\`\`\`
Motor Level Assessment (key muscles):
C5: Deltoid, biceps
C6: Wrist extensors
C7: Triceps
C8: Finger flexors
T1: Finger abductors
L2: Hip flexors
L3: Knee extensors
L4: Ankle dorsiflexors
L5: Great toe extensors
S1: Ankle plantar flexors

Sensory Level Landmarks:
C4: Clavicle
T4: Nipple
T10: Umbilicus
L1: Inguinal crease
S1: Lateral foot
\`\`\`

*ASIA classification (adapted for field):*
- Complete (A): No motor/sensory below level
- Incomplete (B-D): Some preservation
- Sacral sparing: Perianal sensation, toe flexion suggests incomplete

### Improvised Diagnostics

**Clinical tests without equipment:**

*Abdomen:*
- Rovsings sign: RLQ pain with LLQ palpation (appendicitis)
- Murphys sign: Pain with RUQ palpation during inspiration (cholecystitis)
- Percussion: Tympany (gas/air) vs. dullness (fluid/solid)

*Extremities:*
- Talar tilt test: Ankle instability
- Drawer tests: Knee ligament integrity
- Neurovascular exam: Pulse, sensation, motor, capillary refill

*Pulmonary:*
- Egophony: E-to-A change suggests consolidation
- Whispered pectoriloquy: Clear transmission suggests consolidation
- Tactile fremitus: Increased over consolidation, decreased over effusion

### Vital Sign Advanced Interpretation

**Heart rate variability (without monitors):**
- Regular vs. irregular
- Irregularly irregular suggests AFib
- Regularly irregular may be heart block or PVCs

**Respiratory pattern analysis:**
\`\`\`
Cheyne-Stokes: Crescendo-decrescendo with apnea (CNS injury, CHF)
Kussmaul: Deep, rapid (metabolic acidosis, DKA)
Biots: Irregular clusters with apnea (CNS injury)
Agonal: Slow, gasping (impending arrest)
\`\`\`

**Integrating findings:**
\`\`\`
Tachycardia + tachypnea + altered mental status:
Consider:
- Hemorrhagic shock (hypotension, pale skin)
- Respiratory failure (cyanosis, retractions)
- Head injury (focal neuro findings, Cushings response)
- Sepsis (fever, source of infection)
- Environmental (heat stroke, hypothermia)
\`\`\`

### Serial Assessment Protocol

**Stable patient monitoring:**
- Vital signs every 15-30 minutes
- Mental status with each check
- Pain reassessment
- Response to interventions
- New symptom inquiry

**Unstable patient monitoring:**
- Vital signs every 5 minutes
- Continuous mental status observation
- Reassess ABCDEs with each check
- Note trajectory for evacuation decisions

**Red flags requiring reassessment:**
- Mental status decline
- Vital sign deterioration
- New pain or symptoms
- Decreased urine output
- Increasing pallor or diaphoresis`,

      explanation: `## Evidence-Based Field Assessment

### Validation of Clinical Findings

**Primary survey reliability:**
\`\`\`
Finding               Sensitivity  Specificity  Use Case
Absent radial pulse   ~85% for SBP<80  ~95%    Severe hypotension
Altered mental status ~70% for shock   Variable Perfusion marker
Cap refill >2s        ~50% for shock   ~80%    Nonspecific
Tachycardia           ~60% for hypovolemia ~50% Early indicator
\`\`\`

**Physical exam accuracy for specific injuries:**
\`\`\`
Condition           Clinical Findings      Sensitivity
Tension PTX         Classic triad          ~65%
Hemothorax          Dullness, decreased BS ~85%
Pelvic fracture     Palpation instability  ~45%
Solid organ injury  Abdominal tenderness   ~80%
Hollow viscus       Peritoneal signs       ~75% (late)
C-spine injury      Midline tenderness     ~95% (NPV)
\`\`\`

### Predictive Scoring in Wilderness

**Simplified TRISS (Trauma Score):**
While full TRISS requires ISS, simplified field prediction:
\`\`\`
Field Mortality Risk Indicators:
- GCS <9: ~35% mortality increase
- SBP <90: ~30% mortality increase
- RR <10 or >29: ~20% mortality increase
- Age >55: ~20% mortality increase
Cumulative factors increase risk nonlinearly
\`\`\`

**Wilderness-adapted RED FLAGS:**
\`\`\`
R - Respiratory distress (RR>28, accessory muscles)
E - Evidence of shock (SI>1, altered MS)
D - Decreasing consciousness (GCS drop >2)
F - Focal neurological deficits
L - Lateralizing signs (pupil, weakness)
A - Abdominal rigidity
G - Gross external hemorrhage
S - Spine tenderness with mechanism
\`\`\`

### Advanced Physiological Concepts

**Oxygen delivery and consumption:**
\`\`\`
DO2 = CO x CaO2 = CO x (1.34 x Hgb x SaO2)
VO2 = CO x (CaO2 - CvO2)
Extraction ratio = VO2/DO2 (normally ~25%)

In shock:
1. Increased extraction (up to 60-70%)
2. Anaerobic metabolism begins
3. Lactate accumulates
4. Clinical manifestations appear
\`\`\`

**Clinical correlates of oxygen debt:**
- Mental status: Requires ~20% of cardiac output
- Skin perfusion: Vasoconstriction preserves core
- Renal output: Decreases early (sensitive marker)
- Lactate clearance: Not measurable but inferred from recovery

**Compensatory mechanisms:**
\`\`\`
Early (compensated):
- Sympathetic activation (HR, contractility)
- Vasoconstriction (maintain BP)
- Fluid shifts (transcapillary refill)

Late (decompensated):
- Myocardial depression
- Vasodilation (inflammatory)
- Capillary leak
- Irreversible shock cascade
\`\`\`

### Mechanism Biomechanics

**Fall energy calculations:**
\`\`\`
KE = 0.5 x m x v^2
v = sqrt(2 x g x h)
Where g = 9.8 m/s^2, h = height

Example: 70kg person, 10m fall
v = sqrt(2 x 9.8 x 10) = 14 m/s
KE = 0.5 x 70 x 196 = 6860 J

Injury threshold: ~450 J for rib fracture
This fall has >15x threshold energy
\`\`\`

**Injury pattern prediction by mechanism:**
\`\`\`
Mechanism              Expected Injury Pattern         Exam Focus
Feet-first fall        Calcaneus > spine > pelvis     Heel, back, pelvis
Head-first dive        C-spine, head, upper ext       Neuro, neck, shoulders
Bicycle OTH            Abdomen, face, wrists          Abdomen, face, arms
Rock climbing (lead)   Variable by fall angle         Full trauma survey
Avalanche burial       Asphyxia, hypothermia, trauma  Airway, temp, whole body
\`\`\`

### Neurological Assessment Refinement

**Brain herniation syndromes (clinical recognition):**
\`\`\`
Uncal herniation:
- Ipsilateral pupil dilation (CN III compression)
- Contralateral hemiparesis (later ipsilateral)
- Decreasing consciousness
- Cushings response (late)

Central herniation:
- Small reactive pupils (early)
- Bilateral posturing
- Progressive rostral-caudal deterioration

Tonsillar herniation:
- Neck stiffness
- Respiratory irregularity
- Cardiovascular instability
\`\`\`

**Spinal shock vs. neurogenic shock:**
\`\`\`
Spinal shock (cord):
- Flaccidity below level
- Areflexia
- Temporary (hours-weeks)
- Does not indicate completeness

Neurogenic shock (cardiovascular):
- Hypotension + bradycardia
- Warm, dry skin
- Loss of sympathetic tone
- Requires volume + vasopressors
\`\`\`

### Diagnostic Uncertainty Management

**Bayesian reasoning in field:**
\`\`\`
Post-test probability = (Sens x Prevalence) / [(Sens x Prev) + ((1-Spec) x (1-Prev))]

In practice:
- High mechanism energy -> higher pretest probability
- Positive exam finding -> raises probability
- Negative finding -> lowers probability less (imperfect sensitivity)
- Treat probability thresholds, not certainties
\`\`\`

**Clinical decision rules adaptation:**
- NEXUS/Canadian C-spine: Can clear cervical spine clinically in awake, non-intoxicated patients without midline tenderness, distracting injury, or neurological deficit
- Wells criteria (DVT/PE): Adapt for wilderness exposure risks
- Ottawa ankle/knee rules: Useful for unnecessary immobilization avoidance

### Telemedicine-Assisted Assessment

**Remote physician guidance:**
- Video assessment of patient
- Directed physical examination
- Real-time vital sign interpretation
- Treatment recommendations
- Evacuation decision support

**Information to transmit:**
- High-quality photographs of injuries
- Video of patient interaction (mental status)
- Vital sign trends
- Response to interventions
- Environmental conditions

### Quality Metrics for Field Assessment

**Process measures:**
- Time to primary survey completion
- Documentation completeness
- Serial vital sign frequency
- Protocol adherence

**Outcome measures:**
- Missed injuries identified at definitive care
- Appropriate evacuation decision
- Patient trajectory accuracy (predicted vs. actual)
- Preventable morbidity/mortality`,

      clinicalNotes: `Clinical Pearls for Expert Field Assessment:
1. Shock index >1.0 predicts need for massive transfusion better than individual vital signs
2. Mental status is the most sensitive perfusion indicator in young patients
3. Midline cervical tenderness has >95% sensitivity for significant injury - use for clearance
4. Peritoneal signs develop over hours - early abdominal exam may be falsely reassuring
5. Unilateral pupil dilation with declining GCS is herniation until proven otherwise
6. Neurogenic shock produces bradycardia; hemorrhagic shock produces tachycardia
7. Clinical decision rules developed with imaging can guide wilderness clearance
8. Document uncertainty explicitly - "concerning for X, cannot exclude Y"
9. Serial assessment trajectory predicts outcome better than single evaluation
10. Telemedicine can extend expert assessment to remote settings`,
