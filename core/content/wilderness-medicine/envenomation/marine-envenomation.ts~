      explanation: `## Marine Animal Stings

Many sea creatures can sting you, including jellyfish, stingrays, and sea urchins.

## Common Marine Stings
- **Jellyfish**: Tentacles sting when touched
- **Stingrays**: Barb in tail can puncture skin
- **Sea urchins**: Sharp spines can break off in skin

## What to Do for Jellyfish Sting
- Get out of the water
- Rinse with vinegar (or seawater if no vinegar)
- Remove tentacles carefully (protect your hands)
- Do NOT use fresh water (makes it worse)

## When to Get Help
- Trouble breathing
- Chest pain
- Severe swelling
- Sting covers large area`,

      summary: 'Marine envenomation includes stings from jellyfish, Portuguese man-of-war, stingrays, and other creatures. Treatment varies by species. Most are managed with pain control and wound care. Severe reactions require emergency treatment.',
      explanation: `## Types of Marine Envenomation

### Cnidarians (Jellyfish, Man-of-War)
- Nematocysts inject venom
- Pain, redness, welts
- Rarely: severe systemic reaction
- Treatment: vinegar, remove tentacles, pain relief

### Stingrays
- Puncture wound with venom injection
- Severe pain
- Treatment: hot water immersion (113F/45C)
- May need wound exploration

### Sea Urchins
- Spine punctures with venom
- Pain and inflammation
- Treatment: remove accessible spines, hot water

### Venomous Fish (Scorpionfish, Lionfish)
- Spine envenomation
- Severe pain
- Treatment: hot water immersion

## General Treatment Principles
- Control pain
- Wound care
- Tetanus update
- Watch for infection`,

      summary: 'Marine envenomation involves diverse toxins from cnidarians, fish, and echinoderms. Cnidarian toxins cause local necrosis and occasional systemic effects. Many marine venoms are heat-labile, making hot water immersion effective. Management includes decontamination, pain control, and wound care.',
      explanation: `## Pathophysiology by Class

### Cnidarian Envenomation
- Nematocyst discharge on contact
- Pore-forming toxins
- Phospholipases
- Local tissue injury
- Rare systemic: Irukandji syndrome, cardiac toxicity

### Fish Envenomation
- Spine-based venom delivery
- Heat-labile proteins
- Severe local pain
- Tissue necrosis variable

### Echinoderm Envenomation
- Sea urchin spines with toxin glands
- Mechanical injury plus envenomation
- Granulomatous reaction to retained spines

## Treatment by Type

### Jellyfish
- Vinegar for box jellyfish (may worsen some species)
- Remove tentacles (protect hands)
- Hot water 45C for pain
- Antihistamines, analgesics

### Stingray
- Hot water immersion (45-50C)
- Wound exploration
- Imaging for retained barb
- Antibiotics if infection risk

### Sea Urchins
- Remove visible spines
- Hot water immersion
- Deep spines: may leave to resorb
- Surgical removal if joint involvement`,

      summary: 'Marine envenomation pathophysiology involves species-specific toxins with varied mechanisms. Cnidarian toxins cause pore formation and cytotoxicity. Fish venoms are typically heat-labile proteins causing severe pain. Evidence-based treatment addresses decontamination, venom inactivation, and wound management.',
      explanation: `## Detailed Pathophysiology

### Cnidarian Toxins
- Pore-forming: cell membrane disruption
- Phospholipases: membrane breakdown
- Proteases: tissue destruction
- Cardiotoxins: box jellyfish (Chironex)
- Catecholamine release: Irukandji

### Irukandji Syndrome
- Carukia barnesi and others
- Minimal local symptoms
- Delayed severe systemic symptoms
- Catecholamine surge
- Hypertension, cardiac injury
- Pulmonary edema possible

### Fish Venom Toxicology
- Large proteins (heat-labile)
- Local pain mechanism: unknown
- Cytotoxic effects
- Minimal systemic effects usually

## Evidence-Based Management

### Cnidarian
- Decontamination: seawater rinse, vinegar (box jellyfish)
- Tentacle removal: scraping or forceps
- Pain: hot water, analgesia
- Severe: supportive, antivenom (Chironex)

### Fish/Echinoderm
- Hot water immersion: 45-50C for 30-90 min
- Wound care
- Imaging for foreign body
- Surgical exploration if deep/joint

### Antibiotic Indications
- Delayed presentation
- Deep puncture
- Immunocompromised
- Cover: Vibrio species`,

      summary: 'Marine envenomation encompasses diverse toxinologic syndromes with species-specific mechanisms. Cnidarian venoms include pore-forming toxins and cytolysins. Box jellyfish envenomation can cause cardiac arrest. Evidence-based management integrates decontamination protocols, venom inactivation, and intensive supportive care for severe cases.',
      explanation: `## Advanced Toxinology

### Cnidarian Venom Components
- CfTX: Chironex pore-forming toxin
- PhTX: Portuguese man-of-war toxin
- Mechanism: calcium-permeable pores
- Dose-dependent cardiac toxicity

### Irukandji Molecular Mechanism
- Catecholamine excess syndrome
- Possible direct myocardial toxicity
- Troponin elevation common
- Takotsubo-like picture

### Fish Venom Proteins
- Stonustoxin (stonefish): 150kDa
- Hyaluronidase: venom spread
- Heat denaturation at 50C

## Evidence Base

### Hot Water Therapy
- Effective for fish, echinoderm envenomation
- 45C optimal temperature
- Duration 30-90 minutes
- Pain relief within minutes

### Vinegar Controversy
- Effective for box jellyfish
- May worsen some species (Australian data)
- Seawater rinse alternative
- Do not use freshwater (osmotic nematocyst discharge)

### Box Jellyfish Antivenom
- CSL antivenom (Australia)
- Neutralizes Chironex venom
- Efficacy debated for cardiac effects
- May reduce local necrosis

## Special Considerations

### Marine Wound Infections
- Vibrio vulnificus: severe, rapidly progressive
- Aeromonas species
- Mycobacterium marinum (delayed)
- Antibiotics: fluoroquinolone + doxycycline

### Geographic Variation
- Box jellyfish: Australia, SE Asia
- Portuguese man-of-war: Atlantic, Pacific
- Stonefish: Indo-Pacific
- Local protocols may vary`,
