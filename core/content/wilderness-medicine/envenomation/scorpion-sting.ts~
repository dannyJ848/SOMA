      explanation: `## Scorpion Stings

Most scorpion stings are not dangerous. They cause pain like a bee sting.

## The Dangerous One
- The bark scorpion (Arizona area) can cause serious problems
- Small, light brown or tan colored
- Found under rocks, bark, and in homes

## What to Do
- Wash the sting with soap and water
- Apply ice to reduce pain
- Take pain medicine if needed
- Watch for serious symptoms

## When to Get Help Right Away
- Trouble breathing
- Muscle twitching
- Drooling or difficulty swallowing
- Unusual eye movements
- Young children with any sting`,

      explanation: `## Scorpion Sting Overview

Of the 40+ scorpion species in the US, only the bark scorpion (Centruroides sculpturatus) causes significant envenomation.

## Non-Dangerous Stings
- Local pain and swelling
- Resolves in hours
- Supportive care only

## Bark Scorpion Envenomation
**High-risk group:** Children under 10

**Symptoms:**
- Severe local pain (tap test positive)
- Muscle twitching
- Roving eye movements
- Hypersalivation
- Respiratory distress

## Treatment
- Pain management
- Monitor airway
- Supportive care
- Antivenom (Anascorp) for severe cases
- ICU monitoring if needed`,

      explanation: `## Pathophysiology

### Venom Components
- Sodium channel toxins (primary)
- Potassium channel toxins
- Chloride channel toxins
- Result: prolonged neuronal depolarization

### Clinical Effects
- Somatic motor dysfunction
- Autonomic dysregulation
- Cranial nerve dysfunction
- Skeletal muscle hyperactivity

## Clinical Presentation

### Grade I (Local)
- Pain at sting site
- Positive tap test
- Paresthesias

### Grade II (Local + Remote)
- Grade I plus remote pain/paresthesias

### Grade III (Systemic)
- Cranial nerve dysfunction
- Opsoclonus (roving eyes)
- Hypersalivation
- Slurred speech

### Grade IV (Severe)
- Skeletal muscle dysfunction
- Respiratory compromise
- Flailing extremities
- Loss of airway control

## Management
- Supportive care
- Airway management
- Benzodiazepines for agitation
- Antivenom (Anascorp) for Grade III-IV
- Avoid opioids (respiratory depression)`,

      summary: 'Scorpion envenomation pathophysiology involves voltage-gated sodium channel modulation causing neuronal hyperexcitability. Severity correlates with age and body mass. Evidence supports early antivenom use for severe envenomation to reduce ICU requirements.',
      explanation: `## Detailed Pathophysiology

### Sodium Channel Toxins
- Alpha-toxins: slow inactivation
- Beta-toxins: shift activation threshold
- Result: prolonged action potentials
- Repetitive neuronal firing

### Clinical Correlates
- Motor neuron activation: muscle fasciculations
- Autonomic: hypersalivation, tachycardia
- Cranial nerves: opsoclonus, dysphagia
- Respiratory: airway compromise

## Severity Factors
- Age (children > adults)
- Body mass (lower = higher venom dose/kg)
- Species variation
- Amount of venom injected

## Evidence-Based Treatment

### Antivenom (Anascorp)
- Equine F(ab')2 fragments
- Rapidly reverses neurotoxicity
- Reduces ICU admission and sedation needs
- Low adverse reaction rate

### Dosing
- 3 vials IV initially
- Additional vials if symptoms persist
- Most respond within 1-2 hours

### When to Use
- Grade III-IV envenomation
- Age <2 years with any systemic symptoms
- Respiratory compromise

## Discharge Criteria
- Resolution of neurotoxicity
- No respiratory symptoms
- Tolerating oral intake
- Observation 4+ hours for Grade I-II`,

      summary: 'Scorpion envenomation involves well-characterized sodium channel toxins with distinct molecular mechanisms. Evidence-based management utilizes severity grading and antivenom for neurotoxicity. Research continues on toxin structure and therapeutic development.',
      explanation: `## Molecular Toxicology

### Venom Composition
- 50-100 peptide components
- Sodium channel toxins (most clinically relevant)
- Potassium channel toxins
- Phospholipases
- Antimicrobial peptides

### Sodium Channel Toxin Structure
- 60-70 amino acids
- Cysteine-stabilized alpha-helix
- Binding sites on sodium channel
- Alpha-toxins: site 3 (inactivation)
- Beta-toxins: site 4 (activation)

## Evidence Base

### Antivenom Efficacy
- RCT demonstrated rapid symptom reversal
- Reduced midazolam requirements
- Decreased ICU admissions
- Cost-effective for severe cases

### Antivenom Safety
- Acute reactions: ~3%
- Serum sickness: rare
- No fatalities reported
- Safe in pregnancy (limited data)

## Special Populations

### Pediatric Considerations
- Higher risk due to venom:body mass ratio
- Lower threshold for antivenom
- Close monitoring essential
- Consider antivenom for Grade II with rapid progression

### Pregnancy
- Case reports suggest safety
- Fetal monitoring recommended
- Treatment same as non-pregnant

## Global Perspective
- Scorpion envenomation major health issue in Middle East, North Africa
- Different species, different antivenoms
- Fatality rates higher with limited access to care`,
