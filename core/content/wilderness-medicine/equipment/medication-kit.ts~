- Avoid temperature extremes
- Protect from crushing
- Keep organized for quick access

**Temperature considerations:**
- Most medications stable 15-30C (59-86F)
- Cold can damage some liquids
- Heat accelerates degradation
- Body warmth for temperature-sensitive items

### Expiration and Stability

**Understanding expiration:**
- Manufacturers guarantee potency until date
- Many medications remain effective longer
- Solid forms more stable than liquids
- Store properly to maximize life

**When to definitely discard:**
- Changed color, smell, or consistency
- Crumbled or stuck-together pills
- Liquid that has separated
- Any signs of contamination

### Documentation

**What to track:**
- Medication inventory list
- Dosing information
- Known allergies (everyone in group)
- Personal medication lists
- Emergency contact information

## Safe Use Principles

### Before Taking Medications

**Ask yourself:**
1. What is the problem I am treating?
2. Is this the right medication for it?
3. What is the correct dose?
4. Am I allergic to this or anything similar?
5. Will it interact with other medications?
6. Are there situations where I should not take this?

### Common Contraindications

**NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen):**
- Known NSAID allergy
- Active GI bleeding or ulcer
- Severe kidney disease
- Certain heart conditions
- Late pregnancy

**Acetaminophen:**
- Liver disease
- Heavy alcohol use
- Already taking other acetaminophen products

**Diphenhydramine:**
- Need to stay alert (driving, technical terrain)
- Glaucoma
- Urinary retention

### Interactions to Watch

**Common wilderness interactions:**
- NSAIDs + blood thinners = bleeding risk
- Sedating antihistamines + alcohol = excessive sedation
- Multiple medications with acetaminophen = overdose risk
- Altitude medications may have specific interactions`,
      keyTerms: [
        { term: 'contraindication', definition: 'A condition or factor that makes a medication unsafe to use' },

      summary: 'Wilderness medication kit design integrates pharmacological principles with practical field constraints. Evidence-based medication selection covers analgesia, allergic reactions, GI illness, and environmental conditions. Understanding pharmacokinetics, contraindications, and drug interactions enables safe prescribing and administration. Storage optimization and expiration management maximize kit utility.',
      explanation: `## Pharmacological Principles for Wilderness

### Medication Selection Criteria

**Selection factors:**
1. Efficacy for anticipated conditions
2. Safety profile in field setting
3. Stability under storage conditions
4. Ease of administration
5. Weight and bulk considerations
6. Provider training requirements

### Analgesic Selection

**Mechanism comparison:**
\`\`\`
NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen):
- COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition
- Anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic
- Peripheral and some central effects

Acetaminophen:
- Central mechanism (not fully understood)
- Analgesic and antipyretic
- No anti-inflammatory effect

Combination therapy:
- Different mechanisms provide additive effect
- Alternating doses reduces individual medication exposure
- More effective than higher doses of single agent
\`\`\`

**Comparative efficacy (NNT for 50% pain reduction):**
| Medication | Dose | NNT |
|------------|------|-----|
| Ibuprofen | 400mg | 2.5 |
| Ibuprofen + Acetaminophen | 400mg + 1000mg | 1.5 |
| Naproxen | 500mg | 2.7 |
| Acetaminophen | 1000mg | 3.8 |

### Antihistamine Pharmacology

**First-generation (diphenhydramine):**
\`\`\`
- Crosses blood-brain barrier
- Significant sedation
- Anticholinergic effects
- Useful: allergies, sleep, nausea, itching
- Duration: 4-6 hours
\`\`\`

**Second-generation (cetirizine, loratadine):**
\`\`\`
- Minimal CNS penetration
- Less sedation
- No anticholinergic effects
- Useful: allergies, itching
- Duration: 24 hours
\`\`\`

**Selection rationale:**
- Carry both generations
- First-gen for acute reactions, sleep aid
- Second-gen for ongoing allergies

### GI Medication Pharmacology

**Loperamide mechanism:**
\`\`\`
- Mu-opioid receptor agonist (peripheral)
- Slows GI motility
- Increases fluid absorption
- Does not cross BBB (no CNS effects)
- Caution: Do not use with bloody diarrhea or fever (may delay bacterial clearance)
\`\`\`

**Ondansetron mechanism:**
\`\`\`
- 5-HT3 receptor antagonist
- Blocks serotonin in GI and chemoreceptor trigger zone
- Effective for nausea, vomiting
- ODT formulation does not require water
- Prescription in US, OTC in some countries
\`\`\`

### Altitude Medications

**Acetazolamide pharmacology:**
\`\`\`
Mechanism:
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
- Renal: Inhibits bicarbonate reabsorption
- Result: Metabolic acidosis
- Compensation: Increased ventilation (mimics acclimatization)

Dosing:
- Prevention: 125-250mg BID starting 24h before ascent
- Treatment: 250mg BID
- Continue until descent or acclimatized

Side effects:
- Paresthesias (common, harmless)
- Altered taste (carbonation flat)
- Polyuria
- Contraindicated with sulfa allergy
\`\`\`

**Dexamethasone pharmacology:**
\`\`\`
Mechanism:
- Glucocorticoid
- Reduces cerebral edema
- Anti-inflammatory
- May improve hypoxic ventilatory response

Dosing:
- HACE treatment: 8mg initially, then 4mg q6h
- AMS prevention: 4mg q12h (when acetazolamide contraindicated)

Concerns:
- Does not accelerate acclimatization
- Rebound possible if stopped without descent
- Immunosuppression
- Glucose effects
\`\`\`

**Nifedipine pharmacology:**
\`\`\`
Mechanism:
- Calcium channel blocker
- Pulmonary vasodilation
- Reduces hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
- Lowers pulmonary artery pressure

Dosing:
- Treatment/Prevention: 30mg extended-release q12h
- Immediate release: 10mg q4h (hypotension risk)

Note: Does not improve oxygenation, reduces pulmonary pressure
\`\`\`

### Prescription Antibiotics

**Wound infection coverage:**
\`\`\`
Common pathogens: Staph aureus, Streptococci, anaerobes
First choice: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125mg BID
Alternative: Cephalexin 500mg QID (lacks anaerobe coverage)
Duration: 5-7 days typically
\`\`\`

**Traveler's diarrhea:**
\`\`\`
Pathogens: E. coli (ETEC), Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella
Options:
- Azithromycin 500mg daily x 3 (broadest coverage)
- Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 3 (Campylobacter resistance)
- Rifaximin 200mg TID x 3 (non-invasive only)
\`\`\`

**UTI treatment:**
\`\`\`
Common: E. coli, S. saprophyticus
Options:
- Nitrofurantoin 100mg BID x 5 (low resistance)
- TMP-SMX DS BID x 3 (if local resistance low)
Duration: 3-5 days for uncomplicated
\`\`\`

## Storage and Stability

### Environmental Factors

**Temperature effects:**
\`\`\`
Arrhenius equation: Degradation doubles per 10C increase
Practical implications:
- Room temperature (20-25C): Standard stability
- 30-40C: Accelerated degradation
- >40C: Avoid prolonged exposure
- Cold: Liquids may freeze, tablets generally stable
\`\`\`

**Storage zones:**
| Temperature | Duration | Guidance |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| 15-25C | Indefinite | Ideal storage |
| 25-30C | Weeks | Acceptable for trips |
| 30-40C | Days | Minimize exposure |
| >40C | Hours | Avoid |

**Moisture:**
- Most degradation reactions require water
- Humidity accelerates breakdown
- Waterproof storage essential
- Desiccant packets useful

### Expiration Science

**SLEP program data:**
\`\`\`
FDA/DoD Shelf Life Extension Program findings:
- 88% of medications stable 1+ years past expiration
- Average extension: 5+ years
- Some medications stable 15+ years
- Solid dosage forms most stable
\`\`\`

**Medications to not extend:**
- Nitroglycerin (volatile)
- Insulin (refrigeration required)
- Liquid antibiotics (reconstituted)
- Epinephrine (critical efficacy needed)
- Tetracyclines (toxic degradation products)

**Practical guidance:**
\`\`\`
Wilderness context:
- Rotate stock regularly (use and replace)
- Inspect before each trip
- Some expired medication better than none (except above)
- Critical medications: Replace on schedule
\`\`\`

## Medication Administration

### Routes in Wilderness

**Oral:**
- Standard route, most medications
- Requires functioning GI tract
- May be compromised by vomiting, altered consciousness

**Sublingual/buccal:**
- ODT ondansetron, some others
- Faster absorption than swallowed
- Useful when swallowing difficult

**Topical:**
- Local effect, minimal systemic
- Appropriate for skin conditions, wounds

**Intramuscular:**
- Epinephrine auto-injectors
- Requires training
- Reserved for specific indications

### Dosing Considerations

**Weight-based adjustments:**
\`\`\`
Most adult OTC doses are for 60-80kg adult
- Very large individuals: May need upper dose range
- Small individuals: Consider lower doses
- Pediatric: Weight-based dosing required
\`\`\`

**Renal/hepatic adjustment:**
\`\`\`
In wilderness, may not know function
- NSAIDs: Avoid if dehydrated or kidney concerns
- Acetaminophen: Reduce if liver disease/alcohol
- Most: Conservative dosing if uncertain

      explanation: `## Advanced Pharmacology for Wilderness

### Pharmacokinetic Considerations

**Absorption modifiers in wilderness:**
\`\`\`
Factor: Dehydration
Effect: Reduced GI perfusion, delayed absorption
Implication: Onset may be slower, consider alternative routes

Factor: Altitude
Effect: Reduced GI motility, possible malabsorption
Implication: Onset delayed, bioavailability may decrease

Factor: Cold
Effect: Peripheral vasoconstriction
Implication: IM absorption slowed, oral preferred

Factor: Exercise
Effect: Blood shunted from GI tract
Implication: Delayed absorption during exertion
\`\`\`

**Bioavailability considerations:**
\`\`\`
Oral medications:
- First-pass metabolism (hepatic)
- Ibuprofen: ~80% bioavailable
- Acetaminophen: ~90% bioavailable
- Food effects vary by medication

Sublingual/buccal:
- Bypasses first-pass
- Faster onset
- ODT ondansetron: Partially swallowed, partial benefit
\`\`\`

### Drug Metabolism at Altitude

**CYP450 and hypoxia:**
\`\`\`
Research findings:
- Acute hypoxia may reduce hepatic metabolism
- Chronic altitude exposure: Adaptive changes
- Practical significance uncertain for short-term exposure

Implications:
- Medications with narrow therapeutic index: Use caution
- Standard doses generally appropriate
- Monitor for exaggerated effects
\`\`\`

**Renal clearance at altitude:**
\`\`\`
Altitude effects:
- Initial diuresis (acclimatization)
- Possible GFR reduction with hypoxia
- Dehydration common

Medications affected:
- Renally cleared drugs may accumulate
- NSAIDs: Caution with dehydration
- Acetazolamide: Self-limiting (causes diuresis)
\`\`\`

### Drug Interactions in Wilderness Context

**Common interaction categories:**
\`\`\`
Pharmacokinetic:
- Absorption: Food, antacids
- Metabolism: CYP450 inducers/inhibitors
- Excretion: Renal competition

Pharmacodynamic:
- Additive effects (sedation + sedation)
- Antagonistic effects (rare in OTC)
- Synergistic effects (desired, e.g., NSAID + APAP)
\`\`\`

**Wilderness-relevant interactions:**
| Combination | Interaction | Recommendation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| NSAID + NSAID | Increased GI/renal risk | Avoid |
| NSAID + anticoagulant | Bleeding risk | Caution |
| Diphenhydramine + alcohol | Excess sedation | Avoid |
| Acetaminophen x2 products | Overdose risk | Check ingredients |
| Acetazolamide + aspirin | Metabolic acidosis | Caution |

### Anaphylaxis Pharmacology

**Epinephrine mechanism:**
\`\`\`
Alpha-1: Vasoconstriction (reverses hypotension, reduces edema)
Beta-1: Positive inotropy, chronotropy
Beta-2: Bronchodilation, mast cell stabilization

Pharmacokinetics:
- Onset: 3-5 minutes IM
- Duration: 15-20 minutes
- May require repeat dosing
\`\`\`

**Auto-injector considerations:**
\`\`\`
EpiPen/Auvi-Q specifications:
- Adult dose: 0.3mg
- Pediatric dose: 0.15mg
- Injection site: Lateral thigh (through clothing OK)
- Temperature stability: 15-30C ideal, extremes reduce potency

Stability beyond expiration:
- Studies show retained potency months to years past date
- Discoloration indicates degradation (brown = degraded)
- In true emergency, expired better than none
\`\`\`

**Adjunctive therapy:**
\`\`\`
After epinephrine:
- Diphenhydramine 50mg PO/IM (reduces urticaria)
- Famotidine 20mg (H2 blocker for anaphylaxis)
- Prednisone 60mg (prevents biphasic reaction)
Note: These are adjunctive - epinephrine is primary
\`\`\`

### Altitude Medication Advanced Dosing

**Acetazolamide dosing refinement:**
\`\`\`
Meta-analysis data:
- 125mg BID: RR 0.52 for AMS
- 250mg BID: RR 0.45 for AMS
- 375mg BID: RR 0.44 (no further benefit)

Practical dosing:
- Low-moderate risk: 125mg BID
- High risk: 250mg BID
- Start 24h before ascent
- Continue until acclimatized or descent
\`\`\`

**Dexamethasone for HACE:**
\`\`\`
Dosing protocol:
- Initial: 8mg IV/IM/PO
- Maintenance: 4mg q6h
- Continue during descent
- Taper over 2-3 days once at lower altitude

Mechanism detail:
- Stabilizes blood-brain barrier
- Reduces vasogenic edema
- Anti-inflammatory (reduces cytokines)
\`\`\`

**PDE-5 inhibitors for HAPE:**
\`\`\`
Sildenafil:
- Dose: 50mg q8h
- Mechanism: Pulmonary vasodilation via NO-cGMP
- Evidence: RCT shows reduced HAPE incidence

Tadalafil:
- Dose: 10mg daily
- Longer half-life, once-daily dosing
- Similar efficacy to sildenafil

Note: Does not replace descent for treatment
\`\`\`

## Prescription Kit Components

### Antibiotic Selection Evidence

**Wound infection:**
\`\`\`
Pathogen coverage needs:
- Staphylococcus aureus (including some CA-MRSA)
- Streptococcus pyogenes
- Anaerobes (bite wounds, deep wounds)

First-line: Amoxicillin-clavulanate
- Covers all above except MRSA
- 875/125mg BID x 5-7 days
- Alternative: Add TMP-SMX if MRSA concern

Cephalexin limitations:
- No anaerobe coverage
- Less MRSA coverage
- Use for simple skin infections only
\`\`\`

**Respiratory infection:**
\`\`\`
Pathogens: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, atypicals
Options:

- Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125mg BID x 5-7 days
- Doxycycline 100mg BID x 5-7 days (atypical coverage)

Note: Most wilderness respiratory infections are viral
\`\`\`

### Controlled Substances Considerations

**Legal framework:**
\`\`\`
Carrying controlled substances:
- Requires valid prescription
- Keep in original container
- Carry documentation
- International travel: Check destination laws
\`\`\`

**Practical considerations:**
\`\`\`
Opioid analgesics:
- Reserve for severe pain (fractures, burns)
- Sedation risk in wilderness
- Respiratory depression at altitude
- Loss/theft concerns

Benzodiazepines:
- Seizure management
- Severe anxiety/panic
- Sedation risk
- Altitude interaction concerns
\`\`\`

      explanation: `## Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Integration

### PK/PD Modeling in Wilderness Context

**Concentration-effect relationships:**
\`\`\`
NSAIDs:
- Effect correlates with tissue concentration
- Sustained levels provide better inflammatory control
- Naproxen's longer half-life: More sustained effect

Acetaminophen:
- CNS penetration required for analgesia
- Peak effect ~1 hour
- Hepatotoxicity correlates with reactive metabolite
\`\`\`

**Time-dependent effects:**
\`\`\`
Antibiotics:
- Time above MIC critical for beta-lactams
- Peak:MIC ratio important for fluoroquinolones
- Area under curve for azithromycin

Implications:
- Adherence to dosing schedule important
- Some antibiotics more forgiving (azithromycin)
\`\`\`

### Environmental Pharmacology

**Altitude effects on drug PK/PD:**
\`\`\`
Absorption:
- Reduced GI perfusion at altitude
- Delayed gastric emptying
- Practical: Slower onset for oral medications

Distribution:
- Hemoconcentration (dehydration, polycythemia)
- Plasma protein binding may change
- Practical: Slightly higher free drug levels

Metabolism:
- Hypoxic CYP450 depression (animal data, uncertain in humans)
- Individual variation significant
- Practical: Use standard doses, monitor response

Excretion:
- Renal function may decrease with hypoxia
- Dehydration common
- Practical: Hydrate well, avoid nephrotoxins if dehydrated
\`\`\`

**Cold environment effects:**
\`\`\`
IM absorption:
- Vasoconstriction reduces absorption
- Epinephrine: Consider multiple doses if no response
- Warm injection site if possible

Oral absorption:
- Generally less affected than IM
- Prefer oral route in cold

Topical:
- Reduced perfusion limits local absorption
- May need systemic therapy if severe
\`\`\`

### Drug Stability Science

**Arrhenius kinetics:**
\`\`\`
k = A * e^(-Ea/RT)
Practical rule: Degradation rate doubles per 10C increase

Storage implications:
- 25C (baseline): Standard shelf life
- 35C: Half shelf life
- 45C: Quarter shelf life

Wilderness scenario:
- Summer backpacking: Significant heat exposure
- Keep medications in pack core (moderated temp)
- Avoid leaving in vehicles, tent exposed to sun
\`\`\`

**Specific medication stability:**
\`\`\`
| Medication | Heat Sensitivity | Cold Sensitivity | Notes |
|------------|------------------|------------------|-------|
| Epinephrine | High | Moderate | Protect from light, heat |
| Ibuprofen | Low | None | Very stable |
| Acetaminophen | Low | None | Very stable |
| Insulin | High | High (freezing) | Refrigerate ideally |
| Ondansetron ODT | Moderate | None | Keep dry |
| Nitroglycerin | Very high | Moderate | Replace on schedule |

### Advanced Epinephrine Pharmacology

**Receptor pharmacology detail:**
\`\`\`
Alpha-1:
- Vascular smooth muscle vasoconstriction
- Reverses vasodilation and hypotension
- Reduces mucosal edema (airway)

Beta-1:
- Cardiac: Increased contractility (positive inotropy)
- Cardiac: Increased rate (positive chronotropy)
- Supports blood pressure

Beta-2:
- Bronchial smooth muscle relaxation
- Reverses bronchospasm
- Mast cell stabilization (reduces mediator release)
- Enhances alveolar fluid clearance
\`\`\`

**Dosing pharmacokinetics:**
\`\`\`
IM (anterolateral thigh):
- Peak concentration: 8-10 minutes
- Duration of effect: 15-20 minutes
- May require repeat q5-15 minutes

IV (for healthcare providers):
- Bolus: 0.1-0.3mg (more precise dosing)
- Infusion for refractory cases
- Higher risk of adverse effects

Subcutaneous:
- Slower absorption
- Less preferred for anaphylaxis
- May be used if IM not possible
\`\`\`

**Auto-injector evidence:**
\`\`\`
Stability studies:
- Room temperature storage preferred
- Brief heat exposure (<40C): Acceptable
- Prolonged heat: Concentration decreases
- Discoloration = degradation (do not use if brown)

Expired devices:
- Studies show retained potency for months-years
- Epinephrine concentration decreases over time
- Emergency: Expired device >> no device
- Regular replacement remains recommended
\`\`\`

### Evidence-Based Antibiotic Selection

**Wound infection meta-analysis:**
\`\`\`
Pathogen distribution (wilderness injuries):
- S. aureus: 40-50% (10-20% MRSA depending on region)
- Streptococci: 20-30%
- Anaerobes: 10-20% (higher in bites, deep wounds)
- Gram-negatives: 5-10%

Treatment outcomes (RCTs):
- Amoxicillin-clavulanate: 90-95% clinical cure
- Cephalexin: 85-90% (lower anaerobe coverage)
- TMP-SMX: 90% (better MRSA, no Strep)
\`\`\`

**Traveler's diarrhea evidence:**
\`\`\`
Pathogen distribution:
- ETEC: 30-40%
- Campylobacter: 15-20%
- Shigella: 5-15%
- Salmonella: 5-10%
- Viral: 10-20%
- Unknown: 20-30%

Antibiotic efficacy:
| Agent | Duration Reduction | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------|
| Azithromycin | 60% | Broad, Campylobacter coverage |
| Ciprofloxacin | 50% | Resistance increasing |
| Rifaximin | 40% | Non-invasive only |

Current recommendation: Azithromycin as first-line

## Advanced Kit Design

### Decision Analysis for Kit Contents

**Expected value framework:**
\`\`\`
EV(medication) = P(need) * [Benefit(if used) - Harm(if used)] - Cost(weight, bulk)

High EV items (always carry):
- Epinephrine (if allergic): P(need) low, Benefit extreme
- Ibuprofen: P(need) high, Benefit moderate
- Ondansetron: P(need) moderate, Benefit high (enables function)

Low EV items (trip-dependent):
- Specialized antibiotics: P(need) low unless specific risk
- Altitude medications: P(need) varies by trip
\`\`\`

### Provider-Level Medications

**Sedation for procedures:**
\`\`\`
Indications: Fracture reduction, wound care, evacuation
Options:
- Ketamine (IM/IV): Dissociative, maintains airway
- Midazolam (IM/IN): Anxiolysis, amnesia
- Fentanyl (IN/SL): Analgesia

Requirements:
- Advanced provider training
- Monitoring capability
- Reversal agents
- Appropriate setting
\`\`\`

**Vasopressors for refractory shock:**
\`\`\`
Indications: Anaphylaxis refractory to epinephrine bolus
Options:
- Epinephrine infusion
- Norepinephrine infusion (requires IV access, pump)

Wilderness reality:
- May not be feasible
- Focus on rapid evacuation
- Repeat epinephrine boluses as bridge
\`\`\`

### Documentation and Quality

**Medical direction protocols:**
\`\`\`
For non-physician providers:
- Written protocols for medication use
- Standing orders covering anticipated scenarios
- Communication plan with medical direction
- Quality review of medication administrations
\`\`\`

**Quality metrics:**
\`\`\`
Process:
- Kit audit compliance
- Expiration management
- Inventory accuracy
- Protocol adherence

Outcome:
- Medication effectiveness (documented response)
- Adverse events
- Unexpected needs (items not carried)

      clinicalNotes: `Clinical Pearls for Medication Kits:
1. Ibuprofen + acetaminophen combination superior to either alone (NNT 1.5)
2. Epinephrine auto-injectors may retain potency beyond expiration but replace regularly
3. Discolored epinephrine (brown) indicates degradation - do not use if alternative available
4. Acetazolamide 125mg BID is as effective as higher doses with fewer side effects
5. Azithromycin is first-line for traveler's diarrhea due to Campylobacter coverage
6. NSAID absorption may be delayed at altitude due to reduced GI perfusion
7. Cold reduces IM absorption - may need repeat epinephrine doses
8. Heat exposure accelerates medication degradation - Arrhenius doubling per 10C
9. Dexamethasone treats HACE symptoms but does not replace descent
10. PDE-5 inhibitors (sildenafil, tadalafil) are evidence-based alternatives for HAPE prophylaxis`,
