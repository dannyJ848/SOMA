      summary: 'A wilderness first aid kit has supplies to help injured people when you are far from hospitals. It should have things to stop bleeding, cover wounds, help with pain, and keep people warm. You can also make medical supplies from things in nature or your regular gear.',
      explanation: `## What Is a Wilderness First Aid Kit?

A wilderness first aid kit is a collection of medical supplies you carry when hiking, camping, or traveling far from help. It helps you treat injuries and illness until you can get to a doctor.

## The Most Important Items

**For Bleeding:**
- Bandages of different sizes
- Gauze pads
- Tape
- Elastic wrap
- A tourniquet (for very bad bleeding)

**For Wounds:**
- Antiseptic wipes to clean wounds
- Antibiotic ointment
- Butterfly closures or steri-strips
- Tweezers to remove splinters

**For Pain and Swelling:**
- Ibuprofen (like Advil)
- Acetaminophen (like Tylenol)
- Ice pack or cold compress

**For Other Problems:**
- Blister pads (like moleskin)
- Antidiarrhea medicine
- Allergy medicine
- Sunscreen and lip balm

**Tools:**
- Scissors or knife
- Safety pins
- Medical tape
- Splint material

## Making Supplies from What You Have

When you run out of supplies or do not have the right thing, you can improvise:

**Bandages from clothing:**
- Cut strips from a clean t-shirt
- Use a bandana as a sling

**Splints from nature:**
- Straight sticks padded with clothing
- Trekking poles
- Sleeping pad cut and shaped

**Wound cleaning:**
- Clean water (from your water bottle)
- Soap if available

**Cold compress:**
- Snow or ice wrapped in cloth
- Wet cloth in cold water

## How Big Should Your Kit Be?

Your kit size depends on:
- How long your trip is
- How many people are in your group
- How far from help you will be
- Your medical knowledge

**Day hike:** Small kit, basic supplies
**Weekend trip:** Medium kit, more supplies
**Expedition:** Large kit, advanced supplies

## Taking Care of Your Kit

- Check it before every trip
- Replace used items
- Throw away expired medicines
- Keep it dry and protected
- Know where everything is`,

      summary: 'A wilderness first aid kit balances comprehensive medical supplies against weight and bulk constraints. Core components address wound care, musculoskeletal injuries, medications, and emergency situations. Improvisation skills extend limited supplies, while kit customization matches trip demands and provider capability.',
      explanation: `## Wilderness First Aid Kit Philosophy

Unlike urban settings where advanced care is minutes away, wilderness medical care may last hours to days. Your kit must support extended care with finite supplies.

### Principles
1. **Cover the likely scenarios** - blisters, sprains, cuts, GI illness
2. **Prepare for serious emergencies** - severe bleeding, fractures, anaphylaxis
3. **Enable extended care** - enough supplies for hours/days of treatment
4. **Stay portable** - weight and bulk must be reasonable for your activity

      explanation: `## Evidence-Based Component Selection

### Hemorrhage Control Evidence

**Tourniquet efficacy:**
\`\`\`
Military data (Iraq/Afghanistan):
- Mortality reduction: ~85% when applied before shock
- Complication rate: <2% with proper use and timely removal
- Nerve injury: Rare with <2 hour application
- Limb loss: Not attributable to tourniquet when indicated

Civilian extrapolation:
- Boston Marathon bombing: Positive outcomes
- Mass casualty events: Accepted standard
\`\`\`

**Tourniquet selection criteria:**
| Feature | CAT Gen 7 | SOFTT-W | RATS |
|---------|-----------|---------|------|
| Weight | 78g | 80g | 68g |
| Width | 1.5" | 1" | 1" |
| Self-application | Easy | Moderate | Easy |
| Evidence | Most studied | Military proven | Limited data |
| Cost | $$ | $$ | $ |

**Hemostatic agent evidence:**
\`\`\`
Combat gauze (kaolin-impregnated):
- Time to hemostasis: 2.3 min (vs 4.8 min plain gauze)
- Success rate: 91% (vs 67% plain gauze)
- Mechanism: Contact activation of intrinsic pathway

Chitosan-based (Celox):
- Similar efficacy to kaolin
- May work in coagulopathic patients
- No theoretical exothermic risk

Note: Training in wound packing technique essential
\`\`\`

### Wound Care Evidence

**Irrigation parameters:**
\`\`\`
Pressure:
- 5-8 psi optimal (achievable with syringe)
- <1 psi ineffective
- >15 psi may drive bacteria deeper

Volume:
- Minimum 100ml/cm wound length
- More is better for contaminated wounds
- 1L for average laceration reasonable

Solution:
- Tap water equivalent to saline (Cochrane review)
- No benefit to antiseptic solutions for irrigation
- Clean potable water acceptable in wilderness
\`\`\`

**Wound closure evidence:**
\`\`\`
Timing:
- "Golden period" of 6-8 hours oversimplified
- Clean wounds: May close up to 18-24 hours
- Contaminated wounds: Delayed primary closure or secondary intention

Technique comparison:
- Sutures vs staples: Equivalent outcomes
- Tissue adhesive: Good for clean, low-tension wounds
- Steri-strips: Adequate for many wounds, less scarring
\`\`\`

### Medication Selection Evidence

**NSAID comparative efficacy:**
\`\`\`
Pain relief (NNT for 50% pain reduction):
- Ibuprofen 400mg: NNT 2.5
- Naproxen 500mg: NNT 2.7
- Acetaminophen 1000mg: NNT 3.8
- Combination superior to single agent

Anti-inflammatory:
- Ibuprofen effective for acute injury
- Limit duration to reduce adverse effects
\`\`\`

**Altitude medication evidence:**
\`\`\`
Acetazolamide for AMS prevention:
- RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.39-0.56)
- NNT 4-6 for high-risk ascent
- Effective dose: 125-250mg BID

Dexamethasone for AMS prevention:
- RR 0.60 (95% CI 0.48-0.76)
- Used when acetazolamide contraindicated
- Concerns about rebound, immunosuppression
\`\`\`

## Kit Optimization Algorithms

- Ibuprofen: High probability, moderate benefit, minimal weight
- Tape: Very high probability, moderate benefit, low weight

Low value items (optional):
- Rarely used specialty items
- Heavy equipment with narrow indication
- Items duplicating improvisation capability
\`\`\`

### Modular Kit System

**Core module (always carry):**
\`\`\`
Weight target: 200-300g
Contents:
- Basic wound care (bandages, gauze, tape)
- Tourniquet
- Gloves
- Pain medication (ibuprofen, acetaminophen)
- Blister supplies
- Emergency blanket
\`\`\`

**Extended module (add for backcountry):**
\`\`\`
Weight: Additional 300-400g
Contents:
- Hemostatic gauze
- SAM splint
- Irrigation syringe
- Elastic bandages
- Extended medications
- Chest seal
\`\`\`

**Leader/group module (team medical kit):**
\`\`\`
Weight: Additional 500g+
Contents:
- Expanded quantities
- Redundant critical items
- Advanced medications (if trained)
- Documentation supplies
- Communication device
\`\`\`

### Customization Matrix

**Trip profile scoring:**
\`\`\`
Duration score: Day=1, Overnight=2, Extended=3
Remoteness score: Near=1, Moderate=2, Remote=3
Technical risk score: Low=1, Moderate=2, High=3
Group size factor: 1 + (n-1)*0.2

Kit weight = Base * (Duration + Remoteness + Risk) * Group factor
\`\`\`

## Advanced Improvisation

### Systematic Improvisation Framework

**Material assessment:**
\`\`\`
Available categories:
1. Dedicated medical supplies (use first)
2. Outdoor gear (packs, poles, pads)
3. Clothing (clean, cuttable)
4. Natural materials (sticks, moss, bark)
5. Found items (bottles, containers)

Selection criteria:
- Clean/cleanable
- Appropriate mechanical properties
- Adequate size
- Secure and stay in place
\`\`\`

### Advanced Improvised Techniques

**Improvised traction splint:**
\`\`\`
Indication: Femur fracture (reduces pain, bleeding, muscle spasm)
Materials: Two trekking poles, padding, cordage, ankle hitch
Construction:
1. Pad poles, secure to leg
2. Create ankle hitch (figure-8 or commercial)
3. Apply traction via pole extension or rope system
4. Traction until muscle relaxation, not "normal length"
Monitoring: Pulse, sensation, color checks
\`\`\`

**Improvised pelvic binder:**
\`\`\`
Indication: Unstable pelvic fracture
Materials: Wide strap (pack hip belt, clothing strip)
Position: At level of greater trochanters (not iliac crests)
Tension: Enough to stabilize, not compress
Note: Reduce pelvic volume, tamponade bleeding
\`\`\`

**Improvised nasopharyngeal airway:**
\`\`\`
Materials: Flexible tubing (hydration hose), lubrication
Size: Approximate nostril size, length to tragus
Caution: Not for facial trauma, basilar skull fracture
Note: Commercial NPA vastly preferred
\`\`\`

### Improvisation Limitations

**Know when improvisation inappropriate:**
- When commercial alternative critical (tourniquet)
- When improvised failure high-consequence
- When you lack knowledge/skill for assessment
- When patient can wait for proper equipment

## Quality and Maintenance

### Kit Audit Protocol

**Pre-season:**
\`\`\`
1. Complete inventory against list
2. Check all medication expiration dates
3. Inspect equipment condition
4. Replace used/expired items
5. Update contents based on training
6. Test electronic items (batteries)
\`\`\`

**Post-trip:**
\`\`\`
1. Restock used items
2. Dry wet contents
3. Note any items needed but not carried
4. Document any improvisations used
5. Update kit based on experience
\`\`\`

### Medication Management

**Stability considerations:**
\`\`\`
Heat: Most medications stable to 40C for short periods
Cold: Avoid freezing of liquids
Humidity: Keep medications in sealed containers
Light: Protect light-sensitive items
\`\`\`

**Expiration extension:**
\`\`\`
SLEP studies (military):
- Many medications stable years past expiration
- Solid forms more stable than liquids
- Tetracyclines and liquid antibiotics exception (discard)
- Wilderness context: Some expired medication better than none
Note: Rotate stock, do not rely on expired medications

      explanation: `## Evidence Synthesis for Kit Design

### Hemorrhage Control Meta-Analysis

**Tourniquet evidence synthesis:**
\`\`\`
Source: Military trauma registry, civilian mass casualty data
Sample: >10,000 tourniquet applications documented

Mortality analysis:
- Pre-shock application: Mortality 6%
- Post-shock application: Mortality 89%
- Absolute risk reduction: 83%
- NNT: 1.2 for pre-shock application

Complication rates:
- Nerve palsy: 1.5% (mostly transient)
- Compartment syndrome: 0.4% (may be injury-related)
- Limb loss: Not attributable to tourniquet alone

Time tolerance:
- 2 hours: Safe with minimal complications
- 2-6 hours: Increasing risk, still beneficial if indicated
- >6 hours: Significant ischemia risk

Tourniquet selection evidence:
- CAT Gen 7: Most extensively studied
- SOFTT-W: Military alternative, equivalent
- Improvised: 40% failure rate (do not rely on)

### Wound Care Evidence Integration

**Irrigation evidence synthesis:**
\`\`\`
Cochrane systematic review findings:
- Tap water equivalent to sterile saline
- No benefit to antiseptic solutions (may impair healing)
- Higher pressure (5-8 psi) superior to low pressure
- Volume correlated with reduced infection

Practical application:
- Use cleanest available water
- Syringe provides adequate pressure
- Minimum 250ml (ideally 500-1000ml)
- More aggressive irrigation for contaminated wounds
\`\`\`

**Wound closure meta-analysis:**
\`\`\`
Sutures vs staples:
- Cosmetic outcome: Equivalent for non-facial wounds
- Infection rates: Equivalent
- Dehiscence: Equivalent

Tissue adhesive vs sutures (select wounds):
- Cosmetic outcome: Equivalent to superior
- Pain during closure: Less with adhesive
- Limitations: Low-tension, clean wounds only

Timing of closure (recent evidence):
- Traditional "6-8 hour golden period" oversimplified
- Clean wounds: Safe closure to 18-24 hours
- Highly contaminated: Delayed primary closure preferred
- Wilderness consideration: Adequate cleaning more important than timing
\`\`\`

### Pharmacology for Kit Selection

**NSAID pharmacokinetics:**
\`\`\`
| Parameter | Ibuprofen | Naproxen | Ketorolac |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Onset | 30-60 min | 60 min | 30-60 min |
| Peak | 1-2 hr | 2-4 hr | 1-2 hr |
| Duration | 4-6 hr | 8-12 hr | 4-6 hr |
| Half-life | 2 hr | 12-17 hr | 5 hr |

Selection rationale:
- Ibuprofen: Best balance of efficacy, onset, and safety
- Naproxen: Longer duration, less frequent dosing
- Ketorolac (Rx): Superior for acute pain, short-term only
\`\`\`

**Altitude medication evidence:**
\`\`\`
Acetazolamide mechanism and evidence:
- Carbonic anhydrase inhibition
- Renal bicarbonate wasting -> metabolic acidosis
- Compensatory hyperventilation
- Effectively accelerates acclimatization

Dose-response (meta-analysis):
- 125mg BID: RR 0.52 for AMS
- 250mg BID: RR 0.45 for AMS
- 375mg BID: No additional benefit, more side effects
Conclusion: 125-250mg BID optimal

PDE-5 inhibitors for HAPE:
- Sildenafil: Effective for HAPE prophylaxis and treatment
- Tadalafil: Longer duration, once-daily dosing
- Mechanism: Pulmonary vasodilation via NO pathway
\`\`\`

### Antibiotic Selection for Wilderness Kits

**Evidence-based empiric selections:**
\`\`\`
Wound infection:
- First choice: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 BID
- Alternative: Cephalexin 500mg QID (if penicillin tolerant)
- Cover: Staph, Strep, some anaerobes

Traveler's diarrhea:
- Azithromycin 500mg daily x 3 (broader coverage)
- Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 3 (if fluoroquinolone appropriate)
- Rifaximin 200mg TID x 3 (non-invasive)

UTI:
- Nitrofurantoin 100mg BID x 5 (resistance low)
- Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole DS BID x 3 (if susceptible)
- Ciprofloxacin 250mg BID x 3 (broader coverage)

Note: Antibiotic selection requires medical provider assessment
\`\`\`

## Advanced Kit Optimization

### Decision Analysis Framework

**Expected value calculation:**
\`\`\`
EV = Sigma(Pi * Vi) - Cost(weight, bulk, $)

Where:
Pi = Probability of scenario i
Vi = Value of item in scenario i (lives saved, suffering reduced)
Cost = Burden of carrying item

Example - Tourniquet:
P(need) = 0.001 per person-day
V(if needed) = Life saved, or death prevented = Very high
Cost = 78g, $30
EV = Strongly positive (despite low probability)
\`\`\`

### Population-Based Kit Design

**Epidemiology-driven quantities:**
\`\`\`
Based on wilderness injury data:
- Soft tissue injuries: 40% of encounters
- Musculoskeletal: 25%
- Environmental: 15%
- GI: 10%
- Other: 10%

Kit design implication:
- High inventory: Wound care supplies (bandages, tape)
- Moderate inventory: Splinting, elastic bandages
- Lower inventory: Specialized items (used less often)
- Always carry: Life-saving items regardless of probability
\`\`\`

### Systematic Improvisation Methodology

**Decision tree for improvisation:**
\`\`\`
Is dedicated item available?
  YES -> Use dedicated item
  NO -> Understand function needed
        |
        v
        Identify candidate materials
        |
        v
        Assess material properties
        - Mechanical (strength, flexibility)
        - Cleanliness (sterile vs. clean vs. contaminated)
        - Durability (will it last?)
        |
        v
        Modify technique for material
        |
        v
        Monitor closely for failure
\`\`\`

**Improvisation evidence:**
\`\`\`
Few studies directly compare improvised vs. commercial
Available data:
- Improvised tourniquets: 40% failure rate
- Improvised splints: Generally adequate when properly constructed
- Improvised wound closure: Case series suggest reasonable outcomes

Conclusion:
- Carry commercial items for critical functions (tourniquet)
- Improvisation acceptable for less critical items
- Skill and creativity extend kit capability
\`\`\`

### Quality Metrics for Kit Evaluation

**Outcome-based assessment:**
\`\`\`
Ideal metrics:
- Patient outcomes (hard to measure)
- Completion of care episodes
- Unanticipated item needs
- Weight efficiency (outcomes/kg)

Process metrics:
- Time to access needed items
- Item availability when needed
- Expiration/degradation rates
- User confidence and competence
\`\`\`

## Advanced Considerations

### Austere Environment Modifications

**Extended duration (weeks):**
\`\`\`
Medication quantities: Full course for likely conditions
Resupply planning: Cache points, evacuation options
Expiration management: Rotate stock, extend as needed
Weight distribution: Shared group carry
\`\`\`

**Extreme cold:**
\`\`\`
Medication protection: Body warmth storage
Liquid medications: Avoid or insulate
Packaging: Cold can make plastic brittle
Batteries: Cold reduces capacity
\`\`\`

**Tropical/marine:**
\`\`\`
Humidity: Sealed containers essential
Heat: Medication stability considerations
Specific risks: Marine envenomation, tropical infections
Waterproofing: All items protected
\`\`\`

### Legal and Ethical Considerations

**Scope of practice:**
\`\`\`
Kit contents should match:
- Provider training and certification
- Legal authority in jurisdiction
- Good Samaritan coverage understanding

Prescription medications:
- Carry only with valid prescription
- Document medical direction if available
- Understand liability exposure
\`\`\`

**Documentation importance:**
\`\`\`
Medical records in wilderness:
- Document assessments and treatments
- Track vital signs and trends
- Note medication administration
- Record patient response
- Essential for continuity of care

      clinicalNotes: `Clinical Pearls for Kit Design:
1. Pre-shock tourniquet application has NNT of 1.2 - carry one and train with it
2. Wound irrigation is the most evidence-based wound care; clean water at 5-8 psi is key
3. Ibuprofen 400mg has NNT 2.5 for 50% pain reduction - versatile and effective
4. Acetazolamide 125mg BID is as effective as 250mg BID with fewer side effects
5. Improvised tourniquets fail 40% of the time - commercial tourniquets are not optional
6. Tap water equivalent to saline for wound irrigation (Cochrane evidence)
7. "Golden period" of 6-8 hours is oversimplified - clean wounds can be closed later
8. Hemostatic gauze requires proper packing technique - training matters
9. Modular kit design allows scaling without rebuilding from scratch
10. Document all care for continuity and legal protection`,
