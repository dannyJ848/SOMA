      explanation: `## Poison Ivy, Oak, and Sumac

These plants cause an itchy, blistering rash in most people who touch them.

## How to Identify
- "Leaves of three, let it be" (poison ivy and oak)
- Poison sumac has 7-13 leaflets
- All parts of the plant are toxic
- Toxic in all seasons

## What Happens When You Touch It
- Oil called urushiol gets on your skin
- Rash appears 12-72 hours later
- Itchy red bumps and blisters
- Can last 1-3 weeks

## Treatment
- Wash skin with soap and water immediately
- Wash clothes that touched the plant
- Calamine lotion for itching
- Antihistamines may help
- See doctor for severe cases

## Prevention
- Learn to identify the plants
- Wear long sleeves and pants in wooded areas
- Wash skin right away if you touch a plant`,

      summary: 'Urushiol-induced allergic contact dermatitis affects 50-70% of the population. The oil persists on surfaces and under fingernails. The rash is a type IV delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Treatment includes decontamination, topical steroids, and oral steroids for severe cases.',
      explanation: `## Understanding Urushiol Dermatitis

### The Plants
- Poison ivy (Eastern US)
- Poison oak (Western US)
- Poison sumac (swampy areas)
- All contain urushiol oil

### The Allergen
- Urushiol is a resin
- Remains active on surfaces for years
- Can spread from tools, pets, clothes
- Smoke from burning plants can cause airway irritation

### The Reaction
- Type IV hypersensitivity (delayed)
- Sensitization required (first exposure may not cause rash)
- 12-72 hour onset
- Linear streaks of vesicles typical
- Not contagious (rash doesn't spread urushiol)

## Treatment

### Mild Cases
- Wash with soap and water (within 10-15 min ideal)
- Cool compresses
- Calamine lotion
- Topical hydrocortisone
- Oral antihistamines for itch

### Severe Cases
- Extensive rash (>20% body)
- Face or genital involvement
- Oral prednisone taper (2-3 weeks)
- Short tapers result in rebound

## Prevention
- Barrier creams (bentoquatam)
- Long clothing
- Immediate washing after exposure`,

      summary: 'Urushiol-induced contact dermatitis is a T-cell-mediated delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Clinical presentation varies with exposure amount and individual sensitivity. Management includes decontamination and appropriate duration corticosteroids for moderate-severe cases.',
      explanation: `## Pathophysiology

### Urushiol Chemistry
- Catechol derivatives
- Oxidizes on skin contact
- Becomes hapten when bound to proteins
- Langerhans cells process antigen

### Immune Response
- Initial exposure: sensitization
- Subsequent exposure: effector phase
- T-helper cells recognize antigen
- Cytokine release
- Inflammatory infiltrate

### Clinical Timeline
- Exposure to rash: 12-72 hours
- Peak severity: 1-14 days
- Resolution: 2-3 weeks (untreated)

## Clinical Features
- Intensely pruritic
- Erythema, papules, vesicles, bullae
- Linear streaks (plant brushing)
- Black spot sign (oxidized urushiol)
- No spread from blister fluid

## Management

### Decontamination
- Wash within 10-15 minutes ideal
- Soap and water effective
- Commercial products (Tecnu, Zanfel)
- Wash under fingernails

### Topical Therapy
- Calamine, oatmeal baths
- Topical corticosteroids (mid to high potency)
- Avoid on face, intertriginous areas

### Systemic Therapy
- Indications: extensive, face/genitals, severe symptoms
- Prednisone: start 1mg/kg/day
- Taper over 2-3 weeks
- Short tapers (5-7 days) cause rebound`,

        { term: 'Langerhans cells', definition: 'Antigen-presenting cells in the skin' },
      ],
      clinicalNotes: 'The rash does not spread from blister fluid - perceived spreading is due to varied skin thickness and exposure amounts. A 2-3 week steroid taper is essential for severe cases to prevent rebound.',

      level: 4,
      summary: 'Allergic contact dermatitis to urushiol involves hapten-protein complex formation, Langerhans cell antigen presentation, and T-cell-mediated inflammation. Severity varies with exposure dose and individual sensitivity. Evidence-based management addresses decontamination timing and appropriate systemic therapy duration.',
      explanation: `## Detailed Immunopathogenesis

### Sensitization Phase
1. Urushiol penetrates stratum corneum
2. Oxidation to quinone form
3. Covalent binding to skin proteins
4. Langerhans cell uptake
5. Migration to lymph nodes
6. T-cell sensitization (days)

### Elicitation Phase
1. Re-exposure to urushiol
2. Antigen presentation in skin
3. Memory T-cell activation
4. Cytokine release (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-17)
5. Inflammatory cascade
6. Keratinocyte damage
7. Clinical dermatitis (12-72 hrs)

## Clinical Variation

### Factors Affecting Severity
- Amount of urushiol
- Duration of contact
- Prior sensitization degree
- Body location (thin skin more reactive)
- Individual sensitivity

### Atypical Presentations
- Erythema multiforme-like
- Black spot sign
- Id reaction (autoeczematization)

## Evidence-Based Treatment

### Decontamination Studies
| Timing | Efficacy |
|--------|----------|
| <15 min | Very effective |
| 1-4 hours | Partially effective |
| >4 hours | Limited benefit |

### Systemic Corticosteroid Regimen
- Starting dose: 40-60mg prednisone
- Taper: reduce by 5-10mg every 2-3 days
- Total duration: 14-21 days
- Short courses (<7 days): 25% rebound rate

### Adjunctive Therapies
- Antihistamines: minimal itch benefit
- Topical steroids: adjunct for localized disease
- Wet dressings: acute weeping phase`,

      clinicalNotes: 'Oral antihistamines have limited efficacy for pruritus in contact dermatitis as it is not histamine-mediated. The black spot sign (oxidized urushiol on skin) is pathognomonic. Rebound dermatitis with short steroid courses is well-documented.',

      summary: 'Urushiol contact dermatitis pathophysiology involves catechol-protein hapten formation, dendritic cell processing, and Th1/Th17-mediated inflammation. Evidence-based management integrates early decontamination, appropriate steroid duration, and emerging preventive strategies. Individual susceptibility varies with HLA type and regulatory T-cell function.',
      explanation: `## Molecular Mechanisms

### Urushiol Chemistry
- 3-n-pentadecylcatechol and variants
- C15-17 alkenyl side chains
- Oxidation essential for hapten formation
- Electrophilic quinone reacts with nucleophilic proteins

### Immunologic Specificity
- HLA-dependent T-cell recognition
- CD4+ Th1 and Th17 predominate
- CD8+ cytotoxic T cells contribute
- Regulatory T cells modulate response
- Memory T cells persist years

### Cytokine Network
- IFN-γ: Th1 signature
- IL-17: Th17 involvement
- TNF-α: inflammation amplification
- IL-22: keratinocyte effects

## Evidence Base

### Prevention
- Bentoquatam (organoclay barrier): ~68% effective
- Ivy Block\u00ae before exposure
- Potential for oral tolerance induction (experimental)

### Treatment Outcomes
| Intervention | Evidence |
|--------------|----------|
| Early wash (<15min) | Prevents rash |
| Topical steroids | Mild disease only |
| Systemic steroids | Effective, duration critical |
| Antihistamines | Minimal benefit |

### Steroid Duration Studies
- 5-day course: 25% rebound
- 14-day taper: <5% rebound
- 21-day taper: minimal rebound

## Special Considerations

### Cross-Reactivity
- Mango (fruit skin)
- Cashew nut shell
- Japanese lacquer tree
- Ginkgo fruit

### Systemic Contact Dermatitis
- Ingestion of cross-reactive foods
- Widespread dermatitis
- Consider in unexplained flares

### Occupational Exposure
- Forestry workers
- Firefighters (smoke exposure)
- Landscapers
- Prevention and education critical`,
