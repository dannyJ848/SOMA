      summary: 'Some wild mushrooms are very poisonous and can cause serious illness or death. Never eat wild mushrooms unless a true expert has identified them. If someone eats an unknown mushroom, call Poison Control.',
      explanation: `## Wild Mushroom Safety

Many wild mushrooms look safe but can be deadly. Even experts can make mistakes identifying them.

## The Golden Rule
- NEVER eat any wild mushroom you cannot identify with 100% certainty
- "When in doubt, throw it out"
- Cooking does not make poisonous mushrooms safe

## Dangerous Mushrooms
- **Death cap** (Amanita): most deadly, looks like edible mushrooms
- **Destroying angel**: all white, very toxic
- Many others look similar to edible varieties

## Symptoms of Mushroom Poisoning
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Stomach pain
- Confusion
- Symptoms can appear hours to days later

## What to Do
- Call Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222
- Try to identify the mushroom (save a sample)
- Go to the emergency room if symptoms are severe
- Tell doctors when the mushroom was eaten`,

      summary: 'Mushroom poisoning varies from mild GI symptoms to fatal liver failure. Delayed onset (>6 hours) suggests amatoxin poisoning with potential mortality. Early GI symptoms usually indicate less dangerous toxins. Poison center consultation is essential.',
      explanation: `## Categories of Mushroom Poisoning

### Early Onset (<6 hours) - Usually Less Severe
- GI irritants (most common)
- Muscarine (sweating, salivation)
- Psilocybin (hallucinations)
- Usually self-limited

### Delayed Onset (>6 hours) - Potentially Deadly
- Amatoxin (death cap) - liver failure
- Gyromitra - liver and CNS toxicity
- Orellanine - kidney failure (days to weeks)

## Warning Signs of Serious Poisoning
- Onset >6 hours after ingestion
- Severe, persistent vomiting/diarrhea
- Jaundice (yellowing)
- Confusion
- Decreased urination

## Management
- Call Poison Control immediately
- Save mushroom sample if possible
- Early GI symptoms (<6 hours): supportive care
- Late symptoms (>6 hours): emergency evaluation
- Amatoxin: liver transplant may be needed

## Prevention
- Never eat unidentified wild mushrooms
- Expert identification only
- Apps and books alone are insufficient`,

      summary: 'Mushroom poisoning syndromes are classified by onset time and target organ. Amatoxin poisoning causes delayed hepatotoxicity with high mortality if untreated. Early GI-predominant syndromes are usually benign. Management includes supportive care and specific interventions for amatoxin poisoning.',
      explanation: `## Toxin-Based Classification

### Amatoxin Syndrome (Amanita phalloides, A. virosa)
- Onset: 6-24 hours
- Phase 1 (6-24h): GI symptoms (may remit)
- Phase 2 (24-48h): apparent recovery
- Phase 3 (48-96h): hepatic failure
- Mortality: 10-30% with treatment

### GI Irritant Syndrome (Multiple species)
- Onset: 30 min - 3 hours
- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea
- Self-limited (6-24 hours)
- Low mortality

### Muscarinic Syndrome (Inocybe, Clitocybe)
- Onset: 30 min - 2 hours
- SLUDGE: Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, GI distress, Emesis
- Miosis, bradycardia
- Treatment: atropine

### Hallucinogenic (Psilocybe)
- Onset: 30 min - 2 hours
- Hallucinations, euphoria
- Self-limited
- Supportive care

## Amatoxin Management
- Aggressive IV fluids
- Activated charcoal (if early)
- N-acetylcysteine (hepatoprotective)
- Silymarin (milk thistle extract)
- Liver transplant evaluation if severe
- Poison center consultation essential`,

      summary: 'Mushroom toxicology encompasses multiple syndromes with distinct mechanisms. Amatoxin inhibits RNA polymerase II causing hepatocyte death. Management integrates early recognition, supportive care, hepatoprotective therapy, and transplant evaluation. Prognosis correlates with treatment timing and severity.',
      explanation: `## Detailed Toxicology

### Amatoxin Mechanism
- Cyclic octapeptide toxins
- RNA polymerase II inhibition
- Impaired mRNA synthesis
- Hepatocyte death
- Enterohepatic recirculation prolongs exposure

### Gyromitrin Toxicity
- Hydrolyzed to monomethylhydrazine
- Inhibits pyridoxine-dependent enzymes
- GABA synthesis impairment
- Hepatotoxicity
- Hemolysis, seizures

### Orellanine Syndrome
- Cortinarius species
- Delayed onset (2-14 days)
- Tubulointerstitial nephritis
- Often irreversible renal failure

## Amatoxin Management Protocol

### Decontamination
- Activated charcoal if <1-2 hours
- Consider repeat dosing (enterohepatic circulation)

### Specific Therapies
| Agent | Mechanism | Evidence |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| NAC | Hepatoprotection, replenishes glutathione | Recommended |
| Silymarin | Hepatocyte membrane stabilization | Animal data, commonly used |
| Penicillin G | Displaces amatoxin from albumin | Limited evidence |

### Monitoring
- Serial LFTs (AST, ALT, INR)
- Creatinine, electrolytes
- Factor V level (prognostic)
- Mental status

### Transplant Criteria
- INR >6
- Bilirubin >25 after 4 days
- Factor V <10%
- Encephalopathy
- Concurrent renal failure`,

        { term: 'RNA polymerase II', definition: 'Enzyme essential for mRNA synthesis, inhibited by amatoxins' },

      ],
      clinicalNotes: 'Factor V level is a key prognostic indicator in amatoxin poisoning - <10% suggests need for transplant evaluation. Peak transaminases do not correlate with outcome. Contact transplant center early.',

      summary: 'Mushroom toxicology requires mechanistic understanding of diverse toxin classes. Amatoxin RNA polymerase II inhibition causes apoptotic hepatocyte death. Evidence-based management integrates aggressive decontamination, hepatoprotective therapy, and early transplant evaluation. Outcomes correlate with recognition timing and treatment intensity.',
      explanation: `## Advanced Toxicology

### Amatoxin Molecular Mechanism
- Bicyclic octapeptide structure
- Binds RNAP II bridge helix
- Inhibits translocation
- mRNA synthesis arrest
- Accumulation of protein synthesis defect
- Mitochondrial dysfunction
- Apoptosis pathway activation

### Hepatocyte Death Pathways
- Intrinsic apoptosis (mitochondrial)
- ER stress response
- Secondary necrosis
- Sterile inflammation

### Toxin Kinetics
- Rapid GI absorption
- Hepatic uptake via OATP transporters
- Enterohepatic circulation
- Renal excretion of metabolites

## Evidence-Based Management

### N-Acetylcysteine
- Replenishes glutathione stores
- May interrupt apoptosis cascade
- Standard dosing per acetaminophen protocol
- Limited human data but widely recommended

### Silymarin (Silibinin)
- Inhibits OATP1B3 (reduces hepatic uptake)
- Antioxidant properties
- IV formulation in Europe
- Oral absorption limited

### Hemofiltration/MARS
- Removes circulating toxin
- May interrupt enterohepatic cycle
- Case reports suggest benefit
- Not standard of care

## Prognostic Models

| Parameter | Poor Prognosis |
|-----------|----------------|
| Peak ALT | >3000 IU/L |
| PT/INR | >6 |
| Factor V | <10% |
| Creatinine | Rising |
| Encephalopathy | Present |
| Onset to Rx | >36 hours |

## Special Considerations

### Pediatric Amatoxin
- Higher mortality historically
- Early aggressive intervention
- Lower transplant threshold

### Amatoxin in Pregnancy
- Crosses placenta
- Fetal hepatotoxicity reported
- Aggressive treatment warranted

### Legal Considerations
- Intentional poisoning cases
- Forensic mushroom identification
- Chain of custody for samples`,
