      explanation: `## What Is Drowning?

Drowning happens when someone\'s face is under water and they can\'t breathe. It can happen very quickly and quietly.

## Warning Signs
- Someone struggling in water
- Head tilted back, mouth at water level
- Not responding when you call
- Very quiet (drowning is often silent)

## What To Do
- Call for help immediately (911)
- Do NOT jump in unless you are trained
- Throw something that floats
- Use a pole or rope to reach them
- If they are out of the water and not breathing, start CPR

## How to Stay Safe
- Always swim with a buddy
- Never swim alone
- Wear life jackets on boats
- Learn to swim`,

      summary: 'Drowning is respiratory impairment from submersion in liquid. It can result in death or survival with varying degrees of injury. The key to survival is rapid rescue and immediate CPR when needed.',
      explanation: `## Understanding Drowning

Drowning is defined as the process of respiratory impairment from submersion or immersion in liquid. The outcome can be fatal or non-fatal.

## What Happens
1. Breath-holding
2. Involuntary breathing underwater
3. Water enters the lungs (aspiration)
4. Lack of oxygen (hypoxia)
5. Heart may stop (cardiac arrest)

## Risk Factors
- Inability to swim
- Lack of supervision
- Alcohol use
- Medical emergencies in water
- No life jacket

## Rescue Approach
- Reach: extend arm or pole
- Throw: flotation device
- Row: use a boat
- Go: swim rescue (trained rescuers only)

## Treatment
- Get person out of water safely
- Check breathing
- Start CPR if not breathing normally
- Call emergency services`,

      summary: 'Drowning involves respiratory impairment from liquid submersion leading to hypoxia and potential multi-organ injury. Pathophysiology includes aspiration, surfactant dysfunction, and secondary pulmonary edema. Management focuses on rapid rescue, airway management, and CPR when indicated.',
      explanation: `## Pathophysiology

### Aspiration Effects
- Water aspiration (usually <4 mL/kg)
- Surfactant washout and inactivation
- Alveolar collapse
- V/Q mismatch
- ARDS-like picture

### Hypoxia Cascade
- Cellular hypoxia
- Acidosis
- Cerebral injury (most critical)
- Multi-organ dysfunction

## Clinical Presentation
- Respiratory distress to arrest
- Altered consciousness
- Hypothermia (common)
- Variable cardiovascular status

## Management

### Rescue
- Horizontal extraction
- C-spine precautions if trauma suspected
- Remove from water rapidly

### Resuscitation
- Open airway
- Give rescue breaths (priority in drowning)
- CPR as indicated
- Consider hypothermia

### Post-Resuscitation
- Supplemental oxygen
- Monitor for pulmonary edema
- Evaluate for aspiration pneumonia
- Assess neurological status`,

      summary: 'Drowning pathophysiology involves aspiration-induced surfactant dysfunction, V/Q mismatch, and hypoxic organ injury. Neurological outcome depends on duration and severity of hypoxia. Evidence-based resuscitation emphasizes early ventilation and consideration of hypothermic effects on prognostication.',
      explanation: `## Detailed Pathophysiology

### Pulmonary Injury
- Water aspiration volumes typically 1-3 mL/kg
- Surfactant dysfunction (fresh and salt water)
- Alveolar edema
- Loss of functional residual capacity
- Intrapulmonary shunting

### Cardiovascular
- Hypoxia-induced bradycardia
- Arrhythmias
- Cardiac arrest (asystole/PEA)
- Cold water: vagal responses

### Neurological
- Time to hypoxic injury: 4-6 minutes
- Cerebral edema
- Selective neuronal vulnerability
- Hypothermia may be protective

## Resuscitation Approach

### In-Water Rescue
- In-water rescue breaths if trained
- Horizontal extrication
- Minimize C-spine manipulation unless trauma

### CPR Modifications
- 5 initial rescue breaths
- Then standard CPR ratio
- Prolonged resuscitation if hypothermic
- Early advanced airway

### Prognostication
- Submersion time >25 min: poor prognosis
- Cold water may improve outcomes
- Pupil response unreliable if cold`,

      summary: 'Drowning represents a complex pathophysiological process involving aspiration-induced lung injury, hypoxic cellular damage, and potential neuroprotection from hypothermia. Evidence-based resuscitation and prognostication integrate duration of submersion, water temperature, and clinical markers.',
      explanation: `## Advanced Pathophysiology

### Molecular Lung Injury
- Surfactant protein dysfunction
- SP-A, SP-B inactivation
- Inflammatory cascade activation
- Complement activation
- Neutrophil recruitment

### Cerebral Injury Mechanisms
- Excitotoxicity (glutamate)
- Calcium dysregulation
- Mitochondrial dysfunction
- Apoptosis pathways
- Selective vulnerability patterns

### Hypothermic Neuroprotection
- Reduced cerebral metabolism
- Decreased excitotoxicity
- Anti-inflammatory effects
- Cooling rate considerations

## Evidence-Based Management

### Resuscitation
- ILCOR guidelines emphasis on ventilation
- Duration of CPR in hypothermia
- ECMO considerations
- Targeted temperature management

### Prognostication
| Factor | Favorable | Unfavorable |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Submersion | <5 min | >25 min |
| Water temp | Cold | Warm |
| Bystander CPR | Yes | No |
| Initial rhythm | VF/VT | Asystole |
| Pupil response | Present | Absent (unreliable if cold) |

- Hypoxic brain injury spectrum
- Pulmonary complications
- PTSD considerations
- Prevention focus`,
