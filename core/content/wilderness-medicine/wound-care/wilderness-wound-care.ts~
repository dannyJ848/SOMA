      explanation: `## Taking Care of Wounds Outdoors

When you get hurt away from medical help, basic wound care is important.

## Steps for Wound Care
1. **Stop the bleeding**: Press firmly on the wound
2. **Clean the wound**: Use clean water to wash out dirt
3. **Cover it up**: Use a clean bandage
4. **Watch for infection**: Redness, swelling, or pus

## When to Get Help Right Away
- Heavy bleeding that won't stop
- Deep or large wounds
- Signs of infection
- Wounds with dirt or objects stuck inside
- Animal bites

## Keep Your Wound Clean
- Change bandages daily
- Keep the wound dry when possible
- Don't pick at scabs`,

      summary: 'Wilderness wound care differs from urban settings due to delayed evacuation, limited supplies, and infection risk. Principles include thorough irrigation, appropriate closure decisions, and infection monitoring. Evacuation criteria must be understood.',
      explanation: `## Wilderness vs Urban Wound Care

In wilderness settings, wounds may need extended care before reaching definitive treatment.

## Key Differences
- Delayed access to medical care
- Limited supplies and clean water
- Higher infection risk
- Need for evacuation decisions

## Wound Assessment
- Mechanism of injury
- Wound depth and structures involved
- Contamination level
- Bleeding severity
- Tetanus status

## Treatment Principles

### Irrigation
- Most important infection prevention
- Use cleanest water available
- Copious volumes (250-500mL per inch)
- Pressure irrigation if possible

### Wound Closure
- Clean wounds <6-8 hours: may close
- Contaminated wounds: leave open
- Face wounds: may close up to 24 hours
- When in doubt, leave open

### Dressing
- Keep moist but not wet
- Change daily or when soiled
- Watch for infection signs

## Evacuation Indicators
- Wounds to hands, feet, face
- Deep wounds or tendon involvement
- Signs of infection
- Need for tetanus or antibiotics`,
      keyTerms: [
        { term: 'irrigation', definition: 'Washing a wound with fluid to remove debris and bacteria' },
        { term: 'contaminated', definition: 'A wound that has dirt, debris, or bacteria in it' },

      summary: 'Wilderness wound management integrates assessment, irrigation, closure decisions, and monitoring. Irrigation volume and pressure are key to reducing infection. Closure timing depends on wound type, location, and contamination. Antibiotic use and evacuation criteria require clinical judgment.',
      explanation: `## Wound Assessment

### Mechanism
- Sharp vs blunt
- Clean vs contaminated
- Crush component
- Foreign body potential

### Classification
- Laceration: sharp, clean edges
- Abrasion: superficial tissue loss
- Puncture: deep, narrow
- Avulsion: tissue separation
- Crush: tissue damage without break

## Irrigation Principles

### Volume
- 250-500mL per inch of wound length
- More for contaminated wounds
- Less effective after 6-8 hours

### Pressure
- Ideal: 8-10 psi
- 35mL syringe with 18g needle
- Improvised: squeeze bottle with small hole
- Too low: inadequate cleaning
- Too high: tissue damage

## Closure Decisions

### Primary Closure Candidates
- Clean wounds <6-8 hours
- Facial wounds <24 hours
- Sharp, linear wounds
- Wound edges can approximate

### Leave Open
- Puncture wounds
- Bites (except face)
- High contamination
- Crush injuries
- Delayed presentation

## Infection Prevention
- Irrigation (most important)
- Debridement if needed
- Appropriate closure
- Prophylactic antibiotics (selected wounds)
- Tetanus prophylaxis

## Monitoring
- Daily wound checks
- Signs of infection: increased pain, redness, swelling, purulence, fever`,
      keyTerms: [
        { term: 'debridement', definition: 'Removal of dead or contaminated tissue from a wound' },
        { term: 'primary closure', definition: 'Closing a wound immediately after injury' },
      ],
      clinicalNotes: 'Irrigation is more important than antibiotics for infection prevention. High-pressure irrigation significantly reduces infection rates. When uncertain about closure, wounds heal well by secondary intention.',
    },

      level: 4,
      summary: 'Evidence-based wilderness wound management emphasizes irrigation pressure and volume for infection prevention. Closure decisions balance cosmesis against infection risk. Extended care protocols address dressing changes, antibiotic use, and evacuation timing.',
      explanation: `## Evidence for Irrigation

### Pressure Studies
- 8-10 psi optimal
- Reduces bacterial counts significantly
- Higher pressure: tissue damage risk
- Bulb syringe: ~1 psi (inadequate)
- 35mL syringe + 18g needle: ~8 psi

### Volume Studies
- 50-100mL/cm wound length minimum
- More for contaminated wounds
- Potable water acceptable
- No benefit to antiseptic additives

## Closure Evidence

### Golden Period
- Classic teaching: 6-8 hours
- Facial wounds: extended to 24 hours
- Evidence suggests flexibility
- Clean, irrigated wounds may close later

### Risk Stratification
| Factor | Higher Infection Risk |
|--------|----------------------|
| Mechanism | Crush, bite, puncture |
| Location | Extremities, hand |
| Contamination | Soil, organic matter |
| Host | Diabetes, immunocompromise |

## Antibiotic Prophylaxis

### Generally Indicated
- Bite wounds (not closing)
- Through-and-through mouth wounds
- Open fractures
- Significant contamination
- Immunocompromised host

### Not Routinely Indicated
- Simple lacerations
- Abrasions
- Clean wounds closed primarily

### Selection
- Dog/cat bites: amoxicillin-clavulanate
- Freshwater: cover Aeromonas
- Saltwater: cover Vibrio

## Wilderness-Specific Considerations
- Water disinfection for irrigation
- Improvised irrigation devices
- Wound dressing materials
- Evacuation decision making`,

        { term: 'golden period', definition: 'Time window for primary wound closure' },
        { term: 'secondary intention', definition: 'Allowing wound to heal on its own without closure' },
      ],
      clinicalNotes: 'The "golden period" is a guideline, not absolute. Well-irrigated, clean wounds may be closed beyond traditional time limits. Prophylactic antibiotics do not substitute for adequate irrigation.',
    },
    5: {
      level: 5,
      summary: 'Wilderness wound care integrates evidence-based principles with resource limitations. Optimal irrigation reduces bacterial load more effectively than antibiotics. Closure decisions consider wound healing biology, infection risk, and evacuation logistics. Extended care protocols manage wounds through definitive treatment.',
      explanation: `## Wound Healing Biology

### Phases
1. Hemostasis (minutes)
2. Inflammation (days 1-4)
3. Proliferation (days 4-21)
4. Remodeling (weeks to months)

### Wilderness Implications
- Hemostasis: pressure, positioning
- Inflammation: expected, not infection
- Proliferation: moist environment optimal
- Remodeling: protection needed

## Evidence Base for Management

### Irrigation Meta-Analysis
- High-pressure irrigation reduces infection
- Potable water equivalent to saline
- Antiseptic solutions not superior
- Volume more important than type

### Closure Timing Studies
- "Golden period" derives from animal data
- Human studies show flexibility
- Well-prepared wounds can close later
- Contamination > time in importance

## Advanced Wound Care

### Negative Pressure
- Not typically available in wilderness
- Improvised techniques described
- Limited evidence in this setting

### Wound Packing
- Open wounds with dead space
- Saline-moistened gauze
- Remove and replace daily
- Prevents abscess formation

### Adhesive Closure
- Dermabond/tissue adhesive
- Low-tension wounds only
- Not for high-tension or joints
- Waterproof advantage

## Special Situations

### Prolonged Field Care
- Daily wound care
- Dressing changes
- Infection monitoring
- Antibiotic decision
- Evacuation triggers

### Remote Telemedicine
- Photo documentation
- Expert consultation
- Closure guidance
- Antibiotic recommendations`,
