      summary: 'Some cuts may need to be closed with stitches, staples, or special tape. Clean wounds closed early heal better and leave less scarring. Deep or dirty wounds may need to stay open.',
      explanation: `## When Wounds Need Closure

Some cuts can be left alone, but others heal better if the edges are brought together.

## Signs a Cut Might Need Closure
- Edges gape open when relaxed
- Bleeding keeps starting again
- Cut is more than half inch long
- You can see fat or muscle

## Ways to Close Cuts
- **Butterfly bandages/Steri-strips**: For small, clean cuts
- **Medical glue**: For small cuts (must stay dry)
- **Stitches**: For larger or deeper cuts (done by medical professionals)

## When NOT to Close
- Dirty wounds
- Animal bites
- Cuts more than 6-8 hours old
- Signs of infection

## After Closure
- Keep dry for first 24-48 hours
- Watch for signs of infection
- See a doctor to remove stitches`,

      summary: 'Wound closure decisions depend on wound characteristics, time since injury, and infection risk. Clean wounds can often be closed primarily. Contaminated wounds should be left open. Various techniques are available depending on wound type.',
      explanation: `## Closure Decision Factors

### Close (Primary Closure)
- Clean wounds
- Within golden period (<6-8 hours, face <24 hours)
- Minimal contamination
- Edges can approximate without tension

### Leave Open (Secondary Intention)
- Highly contaminated
- Delayed presentation
- Puncture wounds
- Animal bites (except face)
- Signs of infection

## Closure Techniques

### Adhesive Strips (Steri-strips)
- Small, superficial wounds
- Low tension areas
- Apply perpendicular to wound
- May get wet carefully

### Tissue Adhesive (Dermabond)
- Small, clean wounds
- Low tension
- Not over joints
- Keep dry
- Falls off in 5-10 days

### Staples
- Scalp lacerations
- Quick application
- Good hemostasis
- Remove in 7-10 days

### Sutures
- Deeper wounds
- Areas of tension
- Requires proper technique
- Removal varies by location

## Face/Scalp Considerations
- Extended closure time (24 hours)
- Better blood supply
- Cosmetic importance
- Lower infection risk`,
      keyTerms: [
        { term: 'primary closure', definition: 'Closing a wound immediately after cleaning' },
        { term: 'secondary intention', definition: 'Allowing wound to heal open without closure' },
      ],
    },
    3: {
      level: 3,
      summary: 'Wound closure integrates assessment of tissue viability, contamination, and timing. Primary closure reduces scarring but risks infection in contaminated wounds. Technique selection depends on wound location, depth, and tension.',
      explanation: `## Closure Timing

### Golden Period
- Traditional: 6-8 hours
- Face: up to 24 hours
- Clean, irrigated wounds: may extend
- Contamination > time

### Delayed Primary Closure
- Initial debridement and packing
- Observation 3-5 days
- Close if no infection
- Useful for contaminated wounds

## Tissue Adhesive Application

### Appropriate Wounds
- Superficial lacerations
- Length <4-5 cm
- Clean, dry wound edges
- Low tension areas

### Technique
1. Wound edges dry and opposed
2. Apply adhesive over (not in) wound
3. Hold 30-60 seconds
4. Apply 3-4 layers
5. Avoid getting wet initially

### Advantages
- No suture removal
- Waterproof after 24 hours
- Good cosmesis
- Quick application

## Suture Technique Principles

### Simple Interrupted
- Most versatile
- Equal tissue bites
- Evert wound edges
- Appropriate tension

### Suture Selection
| Location | Material | Size | Removal |
|----------|----------|------|---------|
| Face | Nylon | 5-0 or 6-0 | 5 days |
| Scalp | Nylon/Staples | 4-0 | 7-10 days |
| Trunk | Nylon | 4-0 | 10-14 days |
| Extremity | Nylon | 4-0 | 10-14 days |

## Wilderness Considerations
- Limited equipment
- Adhesive strips often adequate
- Tissue adhesive practical
- Suturing requires training`,
      keyTerms: [
        { term: 'delayed primary closure', definition: 'Closing wound after initial observation period' },
        { term: 'eversion', definition: 'Turning wound edges slightly outward for better healing' },
      ],
      clinicalNotes: 'Wound edge eversion is important for optimal cosmetic outcome. Adhesive strips and tissue adhesive are appropriate for many wilderness wounds. Suturing requires proper training to avoid complications.',
    },
    4: {
      level: 4,
      summary: 'Evidence-based wound closure balances infection risk against healing by secondary intention. Primary closure timing guidelines are flexible for well-prepared wounds. Technique selection considers wound characteristics, resources, and provider skill.',
      explanation: `## Evidence for Closure Timing

### Golden Period Studies
- Original animal data
- Human studies less definitive
- Contamination more important than time
- Well-irrigated wounds may close later

### Face Wound Data
- Lower infection rates
- Better blood supply
- Extended closure window safe
- Cosmetic benefit of closure

## Technique Comparison

### Tissue Adhesive vs Sutures
| Outcome | Adhesive | Sutures |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Cosmesis | Equivalent | Equivalent |
| Infection | Similar | Similar |
| Dehiscence | Slightly higher | Lower |
| Time | Faster | Slower |

### Staples vs Sutures (Scalp)
- Equivalent outcomes
- Faster application
- Cost effective
- Appropriate for most scalp wounds

## Advanced Closure Techniques

### Deep Dermal Sutures
- Reduce tension
- Better cosmesis
- Absorbable material
- Buried knots

### Mattress Sutures
- High tension wounds
- Wound eversion
- Horizontal or vertical

### Running Sutures
- Rapid closure
- Good for long wounds
- Less control per segment

## Complications

### Dehiscence
- Excessive tension
- Infection
- Early suture removal
- Technical error

### Infection
- Contamination
- Foreign body
- Inadequate irrigation
- Inappropriate closure

### Poor Cosmesis
- Wound edge inversion
- Unequal bites
- Excessive tension
- Delayed suture removal`,

        { term: 'dehiscence', definition: 'Wound opening after closure' },
        { term: 'mattress suture', definition: 'Suture technique providing enhanced wound edge eversion' },
      ],
      clinicalNotes: 'Tissue adhesive has equivalent cosmetic outcomes to sutures for appropriate wounds. Deep dermal sutures significantly reduce tension and improve outcomes. Early suture removal on the face (5 days) prevents track marks.',
    },
    5: {
      level: 5,
      summary: 'Wound closure science integrates wound healing biology with infection control principles. Evidence supports flexible timing for primary closure with adequate preparation. Modern materials and techniques optimize outcomes. Decision frameworks guide appropriate technique selection.',
      explanation: `## Wound Healing Biology

### Phases and Closure
- Inflammatory: 1-4 days
- Proliferative: 4-21 days
- Remodeling: 21 days - 1 year
- Closure approximates edges during proliferative phase

### Tension and Healing
- Excessive tension causes necrosis
- Deep closure reduces surface tension
- Relaxed skin tension lines guide incisions
- Undermining may reduce tension

## Evidence Base

### Closure Timing
- Prospective studies suggest flexibility
- Risk factors more important than time:
  - Contamination
  - Tissue devitalization
  - Host factors (diabetes, immunocompromise)

### Wound Preparation
- Irrigation most important factor
- Debridement as needed
- Edge freshening for delayed wounds
- Hair removal: clipping not shaving

## Advanced Materials

### Absorbable Sutures
| Material | Absorption | Strength Retention |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Vicryl | 56-70 days | 50% at 3 weeks |
| Monocryl | 91-119 days | 50% at 1 week |
| PDS | 180+ days | 50% at 4 weeks |

### Tissue Adhesives
- 2-octyl cyanoacrylate (Dermabond)
- n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate
- Polymerizes on contact with tissue
- Antimicrobial properties

## Special Situations

### Flaps and Avulsions
- Assess viability
- Debride if needed
- Gentle handling
- Avoid tension

### Stellate Lacerations
- Complex geometry
- May need revision
- Key sutures first
- Accept some irregularity

## Wilderness Applications
- Limited equipment reality
- Training appropriate techniques
- When to close vs evacuate
- Telemedicine guidance`,
