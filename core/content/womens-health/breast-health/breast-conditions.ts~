      summary: 'Most breast lumps and changes are not cancer. Common breast conditions include cysts, fibroadenomas, and infections that can be treated.',
      explanation: `**Common Breast Conditions:**

*Breast Cysts:*
- Fluid-filled sacs in the breast
- Feel like round, movable lumps
- May be tender before your period
- Very common, especially ages 35-50
- Not cancer

*Fibroadenomas:*
- Solid, rubbery lumps
- Usually painless and movable
- Common in younger women (teens to 30s)
- Benign (not cancer)

*Fibrocystic Changes:*
- Lumpy, tender breasts
- Changes with menstrual cycle
- Very common, not a disease
- Not cancer

*Breast Infections (Mastitis):*
- Red, painful, swollen area
- May have fever
- Common during breastfeeding
- Treated with antibiotics

**When to See a Doctor:**
- Any new lump
- Nipple discharge (especially bloody)
- Skin changes
- Pain that doesn't go away

**The Good News:**
- 80% of breast lumps are NOT cancer
- Most conditions are treatable
- Knowing what's normal helps you spot problems`,

      summary: 'Benign breast conditions are classified as non-proliferative, proliferative without atypia, or proliferative with atypia, with varying associations with future breast cancer risk.',
      explanation: `**Classification by Cancer Risk:**

*Non-Proliferative (No Increased Risk):*
- Simple cysts
- Fibroadenomas
- Fibrocystic changes
- Duct ectasia
- Fat necrosis

*Proliferative Without Atypia (1.5-2x Risk):*
- Usual ductal hyperplasia
- Intraductal papilloma
- Sclerosing adenosis
- Fibroadenoma (complex)
- Radial scar

*Proliferative With Atypia (4-5x Risk):*
- Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH)
- Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)

**Common Benign Conditions:**

*Cysts:*
- Simple: Smooth wall, no internal echoes on ultrasound
- Complicated: Internal debris, thick wall
- Complex: Solid component, may need biopsy
- Can be aspirated if symptomatic

*Fibroadenomas:*
- Most common solid breast mass in women <30
- Well-circumscribed, mobile
- May grow, shrink, or disappear
- Usually can be monitored if typical

*Fibrocystic Changes:*
- Umbrella term for many benign changes
- Cysts, stromal fibrosis, adenosis
- Not a disease entity

*Mastitis/Breast Abscess:*
- Lactational: S. aureus common
- Non-lactational: May need biopsy to rule out inflammatory cancer
- Treatment: Antibiotics, drainage if abscess

*Fat Necrosis:*
- After trauma or surgery
- Can mimic cancer on imaging
- Calcifications may develop`,

      summary: 'Evaluation of benign breast disease requires appropriate imaging and biopsy techniques, with management guided by histology and cancer risk implications.',
      explanation: `**Evaluation Approach:**

*Triple Test:*
1. Clinical examination
2. Imaging (mammogram, ultrasound)
3. Tissue sampling (if indicated)
- Concordance among all three increases diagnostic confidence

**Imaging Characteristics:**

*Likely Benign (BI-RADS 3):*
- Cyst: Anechoic, posterior enhancement
- Fibroadenoma: Well-circumscribed, oval, parallel orientation
- 6-month follow-up typically

*Suspicious Features:*
- Irregular shape or margins
- Non-parallel orientation
- Posterior shadowing
- Microcalcifications (certain patterns)

**Biopsy Indications:**
- BI-RADS 4 or 5
- BI-RADS 3 with patient anxiety or high risk
- New solid mass in older patient
- Complex cystic lesion
- Clinical-radiologic discordance

**High-Risk Lesions Management:**

*ADH (Atypical Ductal Hyperplasia):*
- On core biopsy: Surgical excision recommended
- Upgrade rate to DCIS/cancer 15-30%
- Consider risk-reducing medications

*ALH/LCIS:*
- Marker for increased risk, not precursor
- Surgical excision if discordant
- Enhanced surveillance
- Risk reduction: Tamoxifen or raloxifene

*Papilloma:*
- Excision often recommended
- Especially if atypia, large, or associated with discharge

*Radial Scar:*
- Often excised due to association with adjacent malignancy
- May observe small lesions without atypia (controversial)

**Follow-up Considerations:**
- Stable BI-RADS 3 lesions: 2-year surveillance
- ADH/ALH: Enhanced surveillance, risk reduction counseling
- Concordant benign biopsy: Routine screening`,

      summary: 'Advanced management of benign breast disease involves nuanced surgical decision-making, risk stratification, chemoprevention counseling, and management of complex or recurrent conditions.',
      explanation: `**Surgical Decision-Making:**

*When to Excise:*
- High-risk lesions (ADH, papilloma with atypia, radial scar)
- Growing lesions
- Clinical-radiologic-pathologic discordance
- Patient preference after counseling

*When to Observe:*
- Classic fibroadenoma <2-3 cm in young patient
- Simple cysts
- Concordant benign pathology at core biopsy
- Stable BI-RADS 3 lesions

*Surgical Options:*
- Excisional biopsy
- Vacuum-assisted excision (for smaller lesions)
- Cryoablation (fibroadenomas, limited indications)

**Chemoprevention for High-Risk:**

*Candidates:*
- ADH or ALH
- LCIS
- 5-year breast cancer risk >3% (Tyrer-Cuzick)
- Strong family history

*Options:*
- Tamoxifen: Pre or postmenopausal, 5 years
- Raloxifene: Postmenopausal, 5 years
- Aromatase inhibitors: Postmenopausal, 5 years (anastrozole, exemestane)

*Risk Reduction:*
- Approximately 50% reduction in invasive cancer
- Also reduces contralateral cancer in cancer survivors

*Barriers:*
- Side effects (hot flashes, VTE, endometrial effects)
- Underutilization despite evidence

**Complex Scenarios:**

*Recurrent Cysts:*
- Consider aspiration if symptomatic
- Bloody aspirate requires excision
- Multiple cysts may reflect hormonal influences

*Multiple Fibroadenomas:*
- Common in teens and 20s
- Monitor unless symptomatic
- Exclude phyllodes tumor

*Granulomatous Mastitis:*
- Idiopathic inflammatory condition
- Rule out infection, malignancy
- May require steroids, surgery

*Diabetic Mastopathy:*
- Hard, irregular masses in diabetics
- Can mimic cancer
- Diagnosis of exclusion`,

      summary: 'Expert management of breast conditions requires integrating evolving evidence on surveillance versus intervention, addressing overtreatment concerns, optimizing multidisciplinary care, and counseling patients through uncertainty.',
      explanation: `**Evolving Management Paradigms:**

*Observation vs. Excision Debates:*
- ADH at core biopsy: Some advocate observation if small, concordant, fully removed
- Papilloma without atypia: Growing evidence for observation in select cases
- Radial scar: May observe if small without atypia
- Requires careful patient selection and follow-up

*Vacuum-Assisted Excision:*
- Can completely remove smaller lesions
- May avoid open surgery for some high-risk lesions
- Long-term follow-up data emerging

**DCIS Management Controversies:**

*Is DCIS Overdiagnosed?*
- Low-grade DCIS may have minimal progression risk
- Some advocate active surveillance for low-risk DCIS
- COMET, LORD, LORIS trials ongoing

*Treatment Options:*
- Lumpectomy + radiation (standard)
- Lumpectomy alone (select cases)
- Mastectomy (patient choice, multicentric)
- Active surveillance (investigational)

**Multidisciplinary Care:**

*Team Members:*
- Breast imaging specialists
- Breast surgeons
- Medical oncologists (for high-risk)
- Genetic counselors
- Plastic surgeons (if reconstruction considered)

*Tumor Board:*
- Complex cases benefit from multidisciplinary review
- High-risk lesion management
- Discordant findings

**Patient Communication:**

*Conveying Risk:*
- Absolute vs. relative risk
- Time horizon matters
- Comparison to average risk
- Visual aids helpful

*Managing Anxiety:*
- Benign diagnosis can still cause anxiety
- "Not cancer" doesn't mean "nothing wrong"
- Validate concerns
- Clear follow-up plan

*Shared Decision-Making:*
- Chemoprevention (values-based decision)
- Surveillance vs. excision for borderline lesions
- Document discussions

**Research Directions:**
- Biomarkers to distinguish progression-prone lesions
- Imaging features predicting biology
- De-escalation of treatment for low-risk lesions
- Personalized risk assessment tools`,
