      content: `Contraception means preventing pregnancy. There are many methods available, so you can choose what works best for you.

**What is Contraception?**
- Birth control to prevent pregnancy
| Different methods work differently
| Some need a doctor's prescription
| Others are available without prescription

**Types of Contraception:**

**1. Barrier Methods**
- Condoms (male and female)
| Diaphragm
| Cervical cap
| Contraceptive sponge
| Prevent sperm from reaching egg

**2. Hormonal Methods**
- Birth control pills
| Patch
| Ring
| Shot (injection)
| Implant
| IUD (hormonal)
| Prevent ovulation or thicken cervical mucus

**3. Long-Acting Reversible Contraception (LARC)**
- IUDs (hormonal and copper)
| Implant
| Most effective methods
| Last for years

**4. Permanent Methods**
| Tubal ligation (female)
| Vasectomy (male)
| For people sure they don't want more children

**5. Fertility Awareness**
| Tracking your cycle
| Avoiding sex during fertile time
| Requires careful tracking

**6. Emergency Contraception**
| Morning-after pill
| Can prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex
| Use as soon as possible (within 5 days)

**Effectiveness:**
| Most effective: IUDs, implant, sterilization (>99%)
| Very effective: pills, patch, ring (91-99%)
| Less effective: condoms, fertility awareness (72-88%)

**Remember:** No method is 100% perfect. Using condoms also protects against sexually transmitted infections.`,

      title: 'Hormonal Contraception Mechanisms',
      content: `Understanding how hormonal contraception works helps women choose the most appropriate method for their needs.

**Mechanisms of Action:**

**Primary Mechanisms:**
1. Inhibit ovulation (primary for combined methods)
2. Thicken cervical mucus (progestin-only)
3. Thin endometrium (makes implantation less likely)
4. Slow tubal motility (affects egg/sperm transport)

**Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (CHC):**

**Estrogen Component (Ethinyl estradiol):**
| Suppresses FSH and LH
| Prevents follicular development
| Inhibits ovulation
| Stabilizes endometrium
| Controls cycle (withdrawal bleeds)

**Progestin Component:**
| Thickens cervical mucus
| Slows tubal motility
| Makes endometrium less receptive
| Backup ovulation suppression

**Progestin-Only Methods:**

**Progestin-Only Pill (POP):**
| Thickens cervical mucus (primary)
| Inhibits ovulation in 40-50% of cycles
| Slows tubal motility
| Must be taken at the same time daily
| No estrogen-related risks

**Levonorgestrel IUD:**
| Thickens cervical mucus
| Slows sperm motility
| Suppresses ovulation in some cycles
| Thins endometrium
| Local effect on uterus

**Etonogestrel Implant:**
| Thickens cervical mucus
| Inhibits ovulation (most cycles)
| Slows tubal motility
| Continuous progestin effect

**Medroxyprogesterone Acetate Injection:**
| Suppresses ovulation
| Thickens cervical mucus
| Thins endometrium
| Persistent effect

**Contraindications to Estrogen-Containing Methods:**

**Absolute Contraindications (WHO Category 4):**
| History of thromboembolism or current thrombosis
| History of stroke or ischemic heart disease
| Migraine with aura
| Breast cancer (current)
| Pregnancy
| Age >35 with smoking
| Prolonged immobility
| Uncontrolled hypertension
| Diabetes with complications

**Relative Contraindications (WHO Category 3/4):**
| Migraine without aura (category 3)
| Well-controlled hypertension (category 3)
| Obesity (BMI ≥30) (category 3)
| Breastfeeding >6 weeks postpartum (category 3)

**Benefits Beyond Contraception:**

**Combined Hormonal Contraceptives:**
| Regular, predictable cycles
| Reduce menstrual bleeding
| Improve dysmenorrhea
| Improve acne
| Reduce ovarian and endometrial cancer risk
| Improve PMS symptoms
| Reduce endometriosis pain

**Levonorgestrel IUD:**
| Lighter periods (or none)
| Reduce dysmenorrhea
| Reduce endometriosis pain
| Treat heavy menstrual bleeding
| Reduce endometrial hyperplasia risk

**Side Effects:**

**Common (usually resolve):**
| Breakthrough bleeding
| Breast tenderness
| Nausea (especially with CHC)
| Headache
| Mood changes

**Serious (rare):**
| Blood clots (estrogen-containing)
| Stroke (estrogen-containing)
| Heart attack (estrogen-containing)
| Liver problems
| High blood pressure
| Breast cancer (small increased risk)

| IUDs can be placed immediately postpartum
| Higher expulsion rates if placed immediately

**Adolescents:**
| LARC methods first-line:
  - High efficacy
  - Long-acting
  - No user action required
  - Reversible
| Confidentiality essential
| STI screening important
| Condoms recommended along with LARC for STI protection

**Perimenopause (Ages 40-50+):**
| Fertility declines but still present until menopause
| Contraception needed for 1 year after last period
| LARC excellent option
| Progestin-only pills

| Copper IUD (non-hormonal option)

**Medical Conditions:**

**Diabetes:**
| LARC methods safe
| Progestin-only methods safe
| CHC can be used if no vascular complications

| LARC methods safest and most effective
| Progestin-only pill safe (but higher failure rate)
| CHC possible but higher thrombosis risk
| DMPA associated with weight gain

**Depression:**
| Hormonal methods not contraindicated
| Monitor mood changes
| Some antidepressants interact with CHCs

**Epilepsy:**
| Many anti-epileptics induce liver enzymes
| Enzyme-inducing AEDs reduce CHC effectiveness
| Higher dose CHC needed with enzyme inducers
| LARC not affected by drug interactions
| Progestin-only methods also affected

**Rheumatologic Diseases:**
| SLE with positive antiphospholipid antibodies: avoid estrogen
| RA, SLE without APL: CHC may be used
| LARC safe and effective
| Progestin-only safe

**Contraception After Abortion:**

**Immediate Post-Abortion IUD Placement:**
| Safe for both surgical and medical abortion
| Highly effective
| Reduces repeat abortion risk
| Expulsion rate slightly higher but still low

**Immediate Start:**
| Any method can be started immediately
| Quick start protocols for CHC
| No need to wait for next period

**Counseling Elements:**

**Key Messages:**
| LARC first-line for most women
| Dual protection (condoms + hormonal) for STI prevention
| Emergency contraception as backup
| Shared decision-making
| Respect patient preferences
| Full information on risks and benefits

**Myths and Facts:**

| Myth | Fact |
|------|------|
| Birth control causes infertility | False - fertility returns quickly after stopping |
| Birth control causes weight gain | Minimal effect; DMPA may cause weight gain |
| You need a "break" from the pill | Not necessary for most modern pills |
| Birth control causes abortion | False - prevents ovulation and fertilization |
| Withdrawal is effective | Only 78% effective with typical use |
