      content: `Fertility is the ability to become pregnant and have a baby. For most couples, fertility is natural, but some people have difficulty getting pregnant.

**What is Fertility?**
- Fertility is being able to conceive a child
| Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after trying for 1 year
| For women over 35, it's 6 months of trying

**The Menstrual Cycle and Fertility:**
- Your cycle is when you're most fertile
| Ovulation is when an egg is released from the ovary |
| This happens about once a month |
| You can get pregnant around the time of ovulation

**When Are You Most Fertile?**
- About 2 weeks before your period starts
| This is called your "fertile window" |
| The egg lives for about 12-24 hours |
| Sperm can live inside the body for up to 5 days |

**Things That Affect Fertility:**

**For Women:**
- Age (fertility decreases after age 35)
| Weight (too high or too low) |
| Smoking and alcohol |
| Stress
| Certain medical conditions

**For Men:**
- Age (though less than women)
| Smoking and alcohol |
| Weight
| Heat exposure to testicles |
| Certain medical conditions

**When to See a Doctor:**
| Under 35 and trying for 1 year |
| 35 or older and trying for 6 months |
| Known fertility issues |
| Irregular or no periods |

**Remember:** Many fertility problems are treatable. If you're concerned, talk to a healthcare provider.`,

      title: 'Understanding Fertility and the Menstrual Cycle',
      content: `Understanding fertility requires knowledge of the menstrual cycle, ovulation, and factors that affect reproductive capacity.

**The Menstrual Cycle and Fertility:**

**Cycle Phases:**

| Phase | Days | Fertility Status |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Menstruation | 1-5 | Low fertility |
| Follicular | 6-13 | Increasing fertility |
| Ovulation | 14 | Peak fertility |
| Luteal | 15-28 | Low fertility |

**Ovulation:**
- Egg release from ovary
| Usually day 14 of a 28-day cycle |
| Egg survives 12-24 hours |
| Sperm survives up to 5 days |
| Fertile window: 5 days before ovulation to 1 day after |

**Tracking Ovulation:**

**Calendar Method:**
- Track cycle length for several months
| Ovulation ≈ 14 days before next period |
| Less reliable for irregular cycles |

**Basal Body Temperature:**
- Temperature rises slightly after ovulation
| Take temperature every morning before getting out of bed |
| Best for confirming ovulation after it happens

**Ovulation Predictor Kits:**
| Detect LH surge in urine |
| Predict ovulation 12-36 hours before |
| Most accurate over-the-counter method

**Cervical Mucus Changes:**
- Clear, stretchy mucus = fertile
| Thick, cloudy mucus = less fertile |

**Fertility Awareness:**
- Combines multiple tracking methods
| Can be used to achieve or avoid pregnancy |
| Requires training and practice

**Factors Affecting Fertility:**

**Age-Related Decline:**

| Age (Women) | Monthly Fertility Rate |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 20 | 20-25% |
| 30 | 15-20% |
| 35 | 10-15% |
| 40 | <5% |

**Lifestyle Factors:**

**Negative Impacts:**
- Smoking (reduces egg quality)
| Excessive alcohol |
| Caffeine (>200 mg/day) |
| Being very over- or underweight
| Extreme exercise
| Chronic stress

**Positive Impacts:**
- Balanced diet
| Regular moderate exercise |
| Healthy weight |
| Managing stress
| Adequate sleep

**Medical Conditions Affecting Fertility:**

**Women:**
- PCOS (irregular ovulation)
| Endometriosis |
| Uterine fibroids |
| Thyroid disorders |
| Pelvic inflammatory disease
| Primary ovarian insufficiency

**Men:**
- Varicocele
| Low sperm count or motility
| Erectile dysfunction
| Hormonal imbalances |

**When to Seek Help:**

**Recommended Timeline:**
- Women under 35: After 12 months
| Women 35-39: After 6 months |
| Women 40+: Immediate evaluation
| Known risk factors: Anytime

**Initial Evaluation:**
- Medical history
| Physical examination

| Normal evaluation for both partners |
| May involve subtle molecular/cellular defects |

**Ovarian Reserve Testing:**

**AMH (Anti-Müllerian Hormone):**
| Produced by ovarian follicles |
| Stable throughout cycle |
| Low AMH: diminished reserve |

**AFC (Antral Follicle Count):**
| Ultrasound count of early follicles |

**Treatment Principles:**

**General Approach:**
1. Correct identifiable causes
2. Improve natural fertility
3. Assisted reproduction if needed
| Consider age and time constraints

**Lifestyle Modifications:**

**Weight Management:**
- Underweight: Gain to normal BMI
| Overweight/obese: 5-10% weight loss can improve ovulation

**Other Changes:**
| Smoking cessation |
| Limit alcohol |
| Reduce caffeine |
| Exercise moderation |
| Stress reduction |

**Ovulation Induction:**

**Clomiphene Citrate:**

**Mechanism:**
| Estrogen receptor modulator |
| Increases GnRH, FSH, LH |
| Stimulates follicular development |

**Indications:**
| PCOS |
| Unexplained infertility |
| Hypothal-pituitary dysfunction

**Protocol:**
| Days 5-9 of cycle (or 3-7) |
| Start 50 mg, increase to 100-150 mg |
| Monitor with ultrasound (if multiple follicles)

**Risks:**
| Multiple pregnancy (5-10%) |
| Ovarian hyperstimulation (rare) |
| Hot flashes, mood changes |

**Letrozole:**

**Mechanism:**
| Aromatase inhibitor |
| Reduces estrogen conversion |
| Increases FSH secretion

**Advantages:**
| Lower multiple pregnancy rate than clomiphene |
| Better for PCOS
| Fewer side effects

**Gonadotropins:**

**Medications:**
| FSH alone (Follistim, Gonal-F) |
| FSH + LH (Menopur) |
| hCG trigger (Ovidrel)

**Protocol:**
| Injectable |
| Strict monitoring required |
| Can cause multiple ovulation
| Higher multiple pregnancy risk (20-30%)

**Surgical Treatments:**

**Myomectomy:**
| Remove fibroids |
| Improves fertility if cavity distorted |

**Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART):**

**In Vitro Fertilization (IVF):|

**Indications:|
| Tubal factor |
| Severe male factor
| Endometriosis
| Failed IUI
| Genetic conditions (PGD)

**Process:|
| 1. Ovarian stimulation (gonadotropins) |
| 2. Egg retrieval (transvaginal aspiration) |
| 3. Fertilization (laboratory) |
| 4. Embryo culture (3-6 days) |
| 5. Embryo transfer |
