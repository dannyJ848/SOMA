      content: `Infertility means not being able to get pregnant after trying for a while. It's more common than you might think.

**What is Infertility?**
- Not getting pregnant after 1 year of trying (or 6 months if over 35)
- Affects about 10-15% of couples
- Many causes are treatable

**Is Infertility Common?**
- Yes! About 1 in 8 couples have trouble getting pregnant
- You're not alone
- Help is available

**Common Causes:**

**For Women:**
- Problems with ovulation (not releasing eggs)
- Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes
- Endometriosis
- Uterine problems (fibroids, polyps)
- Age-related decline in fertility

**For Men:**
- Low sperm count
- Poor sperm movement (motility)
- Abnormal sperm shape
- Blockages

**Both:**
- Stress and lifestyle factors
- Weight problems
- Smoking or alcohol use

**Evaluation:**
- Both partners are usually tested
- Blood tests check hormone levels
- Imaging tests check reproductive organs
- Sperm analysis for men

**Treatment Options:**
- Medications to improve ovulation
- Lifestyle changes
- Surgery to fix problems
- Fertility treatments (IUI, IVF)
- Donor eggs/sperm or adoption

**Remember:** Infertility doesn't mean you'll never have a baby. Many couples successfully conceive with treatment.`,

      title: 'Treatment of Infertility',
      content: `Infertility treatment is directed at the underlying cause and may involve lifestyle modifications, medication, surgery, or assisted reproductive technology.

**Treatment Principles:**

**General Approach:**
1. Correct reversible causes
2. Improve natural fertility
3. Use least invasive effective treatment
4. Consider age and time constraints
5. Address psychosocial aspects

**Lifestyle Modifications:**

**Weight Management:**
- Underweight (BMI <18.5): Gain weight
- Overweight/obese (BMI ≥25): Lose 5-10%
- Weight loss improves ovulation in PCOS

**Other Changes:**
- Smoking cessation (both partners)
- Reduce alcohol (<2 drinks/day)
- Limit caffeine (<200-300 mg/day)
- Moderate exercise (not excessive)
- Stress reduction

**Ovulation Induction:**

**Clomiphene Citrate:**

**Mechanism:**
- Estrogen receptor modulator
- Blocks negative feedback → increased GnRH, FSH, LH
- Stimulates follicular development

**Protocol:**
- Days 5-9 (or 3-7) of cycle
- Start 50 mg, max 150-150 mg
- Monitor with ultrasound if multiple follicles

**Success Rates:**
- Ovulation: 80%

- Cumulative: 60-80% after 6 cycles

**Risks:**
- Multiple pregnancy (5-10%)
- Ovarian hyperstimulation (rare)
- Hot flashes, mood changes, visual symptoms

**Letrozole:**

**Mechanism:**
- Aromatase inhibitor
- Reduces estrogen conversion → increased FSH
- Shorter half-life than clomiphene

**Advantages:**

**In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Details:**

**Controlled Ovarian Stimulation:**

**Protocols:**

**Long Protocol (Luteal Phase GnRH Agonist):**
- Down-regulation with leuprolide
- Prevents premature LH surge
- Standard protocol, good success rates

**Antagonist Protocol:**
- GnRH antagonist (cetrorelix, ganirelix)
- Added when lead follicle ≥14 mm
- Shorter duration, lower OHSS risk

**Flare Protocol:**
- GnRH agonist from day 1-2
- Induces flare of endogenous FSH/LH
- For poor responders

**Mild Stimulation:**
- Lower gonadotropin doses
- Fewer oocytes, lower cost
- For high OHSS risk or patient preference

**Monitoring:**
- Estradiol levels
- Ultrasound follicle measurements
- LH surge monitoring
- Adjust dosing accordingly

**Trigger:**
- hCG (Ovidrel) when follicles mature
- GnRH agonist (in antagonist cycles)
- Timing based on follicle size and estradiol

**Egg Retrieval:**
- Transvaginal ultrasound-guided
- Sedation or anesthesia
- Usually 34-36 hours after trigger
- Follicular fluid aspiration
- Typically 8-15 oocytes retrieved

**Fertilization Methods:**

**Conventional IVF:**
- Eggs incubated with sperm
- 50,000-100,000 sperm per egg
- Natural selection process

**ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection):**
- Single sperm injected into each egg
- Indicated for severe male factor
- Previous fertilization failure
- Non-obstructive azoospermia (surgical retrieval)
- Fertilization rates: 70-80%

**Embryo Culture:**
- Day 3 (cleavage stage) or Day 5-6 (blastocyst)
- Blastocyst transfer: better selection, higher implantation
- Extended culture: may have no embryos to transfer

**Embryo Transfer:**
- Usually 1-2 embryos (to avoid multiples)
- Day 5 blastocyst transfer preferred
- Soft catheter, ultrasound guidance
- Luteal phase support with progesterone

**Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS):**

**Pathophysiology:**
- Vascular permeability increased
- Fluid shift from intravascular space
- Ascites, pleural effusion possible
- Due to hCG trigger

**Prevention:**
- Antagonist protocol with GnRH trigger
- Lower gonadotropin doses
- Elective cryopreservation of all embryos

**Grading:**

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Mild | Abdominal discomfort, enlarged ovaries <5 cm |
| Moderate | Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, ovaries 5-12 cm |
| Severe | Clinical ascites, hydrothorax, oliguria, labs abnormal |

**Treatment:**
- Mild: Observation, hydration
- Moderate: Outpatient management
- Severe: Hospitalization, IV fluids, paracentesis

**Male Factor Advanced Treatments:**

**Sperm Retrieval Techniques:**

**MESA (Microsurgical Epididymal Sperm Aspiration):**
- Microscopic epididymal sperm retrieval
- For obstructive azoospermia
- Higher quality sperm

**TESE (Testicular Sperm Extraction):**
- Testicular biopsy
- For non-obstructive azoospermia
- May find focal sperm production

**Testicular Sperm Aspiration:**
