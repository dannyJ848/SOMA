      summary: 'PCOS is a common hormone problem that can cause irregular periods, excess hair growth, acne, and difficulty getting pregnant. It can be managed with lifestyle changes and medications.',
      explanation: `**What is PCOS?**
PCOS affects how your ovaries work. It causes hormone imbalances that lead to various symptoms.

**Common Symptoms:**
- **Irregular periods:** Missing periods or having them rarely
- **Excess hair:** Hair growth on face, chest, or back
- **Acne:** Often on face, chest, back
- **Weight gain:** Especially around the middle
- **Difficulty getting pregnant**
- **Thinning hair on head**

**What Causes It?**
The exact cause is unknown, but it involves:
- Higher levels of male hormones (androgens)
- Insulin resistance (body doesn't use insulin well)
- Often runs in families

**Treatment Options:**
- Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) - very important!
- Birth control pills to regulate periods
- Medications for specific symptoms
- Fertility treatments if trying to conceive

**Why Treatment Matters:**
Without management, PCOS can increase risk of:
- Diabetes
- Heart disease
- Endometrial (uterine lining) problems`,

      summary: 'PCOS is diagnosed using the Rotterdam criteria requiring 2 of 3 features: irregular periods, clinical/biochemical hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovarian morphology. Management addresses metabolic and reproductive concerns.',
      explanation: `**Diagnosis (Rotterdam Criteria):**
Need 2 of 3 (after excluding other causes):
1. **Oligo-ovulation or anovulation** (irregular or absent periods)
2. **Hyperandrogenism** (clinical: hirsutism, acne; or lab: elevated testosterone)
3. **Polycystic ovarian morphology** (≥12 follicles or increased ovarian volume on ultrasound)

**Phenotypes:**
- Classic (all 3 criteria): Most severe metabolic risk
- Ovulatory (hyperandrogenism + polycystic ovaries)
- Non-hyperandrogenic (oligo-anovulation + polycystic ovaries)

**Evaluation:**
- History and physical (menstrual pattern, hirsutism, BMI)
- Lab tests: Total testosterone, FSH, LH, TSH, prolactin
- Exclude other causes: Thyroid disease, hyperprolactinemia, congenital adrenal hyperplasia
- Ultrasound: Polycystic ovarian morphology
- Metabolic screening: Fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipids

**Management Approach:**

*Lifestyle First:*
- Weight loss (5-10% can restore ovulation)
- Diet modification (low glycemic index)
- Exercise (150 min/week moderate activity)

*Menstrual Regulation:*
- Combined hormonal contraceptives
- Cyclic progestins

*Hyperandrogenism:*
- CHC (estrogen suppresses androgens)
- Spironolactone (anti-androgen)
- Topical treatments for hirsutism

*Fertility:*
- Letrozole (first-line for ovulation induction)
- Clomiphene
- Weight loss enhances fertility treatment success`,

      summary: 'PCOS pathophysiology involves insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and gonadotropin dysregulation in a self-perpetuating cycle, with significant metabolic and reproductive consequences requiring long-term management.',
      explanation: `**Pathophysiology:**

*Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis:*
- Increased GnRH pulse frequency
- Elevated LH, normal-low FSH
- LH:FSH ratio often elevated (>2:1)
- LH drives thecal androgen production

*Ovarian Dysfunction:*
- Theca cell hyperplasia
- Excess androgen production
- Impaired folliculogenesis (arrested follicle development)
- Multiple small antral follicles (polycystic appearance)

*Insulin Resistance:*
- Present in 50-70% (lean and obese)
- Hyperinsulinemia increases ovarian androgen production
- Decreases SHBG (increases free testosterone)
- Contributes to anovulation

*Adipose Tissue:*
- Peripheral aromatization
- Pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Adipokine dysregulation

**Metabolic Complications:**

*Glucose Intolerance:*
- Impaired glucose tolerance: 30-40%
- Type 2 diabetes: 10% (higher lifetime risk)
- Screen with OGTT or HbA1c every 1-3 years

*Cardiovascular Risk:*
- Dyslipidemia (low HDL, elevated TG)
- Hypertension
- Subclinical atherosclerosis
- Long-term CVD risk elevated

*Endometrial Health:*
- Chronic anovulation → unopposed estrogen
- Endometrial hyperplasia risk
- Periodic progestin withdrawal or CHC recommended

**Pharmacotherapy Details:**

*Metformin:*
- Improves insulin sensitivity
- May restore ovulation (less effective than letrozole)
- Weight neutral or modest loss
- Consider if impaired glucose tolerance

*Combined Hormonal Contraceptives:*
- Suppress ovarian androgens
- Increase SHBG
- Regulate menstrual cycle
- Choose neutral or anti-androgenic progestin

*Spironolactone:*
- Androgen receptor blocker
- 50-200 mg daily for hirsutism
- Takes 6+ months for effect
- Must use contraception (feminizes male fetus)`,

      summary: 'Advanced PCOS management addresses fertility optimization, metabolic syndrome prevention, adolescent diagnosis challenges, and emerging therapies, with attention to phenotype-specific approaches.',
      explanation: `**Fertility Management:**

*Ovulation Induction:*
- Letrozole: First-line (higher live birth rates than clomiphene)
- Clomiphene: Second-line
- Gonadotropins: Careful dosing (OHSS risk)
- Weight loss prior to treatment improves outcomes

*Ovarian Drilling:*
- Laparoscopic electrocautery of ovarian surface
- Second-line if medication-resistant
- May restore spontaneous ovulation
- Risk of reduced ovarian reserve

*IVF:*
- For resistant cases or other infertility factors
- OHSS risk higher in PCOS
- GnRH antagonist protocol with agonist trigger
- Metformin may reduce OHSS

**Adolescent PCOS:**

*Diagnostic Challenges:*
- Irregular periods normal for 2 years post-menarche
- Polycystic morphology common in adolescents
- All 3 Rotterdam criteria may be required in teens
- Focus on hyperandrogenism + menstrual dysfunction

*Management:*
- Lifestyle intervention emphasized
- CHC for menstrual regulation and hyperandrogenism
- Metformin if metabolic abnormalities
- Long-term counseling about fertility and metabolic risks

**Phenotype-Specific Considerations:**

*Classic PCOS (Full Phenotype):*
- Highest metabolic risk
- Aggressive metabolic screening
- Lifestyle intervention crucial

*Ovulatory PCOS:*
- Hyperandrogenism without ovulatory dysfunction
- Lower metabolic risk
- Focus on androgenic symptoms

*Non-Hyperandrogenic PCOS:*
- May have milder metabolic profile
- Menstrual regulation focus

**Emerging Therapies:**

*Inositol:*
- Myo-inositol and D-chiro-inositol
- Insulin sensitizing effects
- May improve ovulation, metabolic parameters
- Generally well-tolerated

*GLP-1 Agonists:*
- Significant weight loss
- Improved metabolic parameters
- May restore ovulation
- Semaglutide, liraglutide

*Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH):*
- Elevated in PCOS
- May become diagnostic criterion
- Reflects follicle pool`,
