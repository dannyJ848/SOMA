      summary: 'Chronic pelvic pain often involves multiple pain generators and central sensitization, requiring a multimodal treatment approach addressing physical, psychological, and social factors.',
      explanation: `**Pathophysiology:**

*Peripheral Sensitization:*
- Ongoing tissue injury/inflammation
- Increased local pain mediators
- Lower threshold for pain signals

*Central Sensitization:*
- Amplified CNS pain processing
- Altered pain modulation
- Explains pain persistence after initial cause resolves
- Hyperalgesia, allodynia

*Psychological Factors:*
- Anxiety and depression common comorbidities
- Pain catastrophizing
- Fear-avoidance behaviors
- Sleep disturbance worsens pain

**Systematic Evaluation:**

*Pain Mapping:*
- Systematic palpation
- Identify point tenderness
- Assess pelvic floor muscles
- Single-digit exam technique

*Red Flags (Require Urgent Evaluation):*
- Abnormal uterine bleeding
- Postmenopausal new-onset pain
- Mass on exam
- Constitutional symptoms

**Condition-Specific Evaluation:**

*Endometriosis:*
- History: Dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia
- Exam: Nodularity, fixed uterus
- Imaging: Transvaginal US, MRI
- Definitive diagnosis: Laparoscopy with biopsy

*Interstitial Cystitis:*
- Urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency)
- Suprapubic pain worsens with filling
- Potassium sensitivity test
- Cystoscopy with hydrodistention

*Pelvic Floor Myofascial Pain:*
- Trigger points in levator ani
- Pain with single-digit pressure
- May contribute to other diagnoses

**Multidisciplinary Approach:**
- Gynecology, urology, GI, pain management
- Physical therapy (pelvic floor)
- Mental health integration
- Often multiple contributing factors`,

      summary: 'Advanced chronic pelvic pain management requires understanding of complex pain mechanisms, multimodal pharmacotherapy, interventional options, and coordination of interdisciplinary care.',
      explanation: `**Pharmacologic Management:**

*First-Line:*
- NSAIDs: Cyclic pain, dysmenorrhea
- Hormonal therapy: Suppress ovulation/menstruation
  - Combined hormonal contraceptives
  - Progestins (continuous)
  - GnRH agonists/antagonists (with add-back)

*Neuromodulators:*
- Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline 10-75 mg)
- SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine)
- Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin)
- Often used for neuropathic component

*Muscle Relaxants:*
- Cyclobenzaprine
- Baclofen (including intravaginal)
- Diazepam suppositories (pelvic floor)

**Interventional Options:**

*Nerve Blocks:*
- Ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric
- Pudendal nerve
- Trigger point injections

*Neuromodulation:*
- Sacral nerve stimulation (IC/PBS)
- Transcutaneous nerve stimulation

**Surgical Considerations:**

*Laparoscopy:*
- Diagnostic and therapeutic for endometriosis
- Adhesiolysis (variable benefit)
- Excision vs. ablation of endometriosis

*Hysterectomy:*
- Not first-line for chronic pelvic pain
- May be appropriate if uterine pathology (adenomyosis, fibroids)
- Counsel about potential for persistent pain

*Neurectomy:*
- Presacral neurectomy (midline pain)
- Limited evidence

**Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy:**
- Internal and external manual therapy
- Trigger point release
- Stretching, relaxation techniques
- Biofeedback
- Home exercise program

**Psychological Interventions:**
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Mindfulness-based stress reduction
- Pain psychology consultation
- Address trauma history

**Treatment Refractory Cases:**
- Reassess diagnosis
- Consider central sensitization treatment focus
- Interdisciplinary pain program
- Patient-centered goals (function, not pain elimination)`,

      summary: 'Expert chronic pelvic pain management involves integrating biopsychosocial frameworks, addressing healthcare disparities, implementing evidence-based interdisciplinary programs, and counseling through treatment uncertainty.',
      explanation: `**Biopsychosocial Model:**

*Biological Factors:*
- Tissue pathology
- Peripheral and central sensitization
- Genetic predisposition
- Hormonal influences

*Psychological Factors:*
- Anxiety, depression
- Catastrophizing, fear-avoidance
- History of trauma (often overlooked)
- Sleep disturbance

*Social Factors:*
- Relationship impacts
- Work disability
- Healthcare utilization
- Social isolation

**Trauma-Informed Care:**
- High prevalence of trauma history in CPP
- Screen sensitively
- Avoid retraumatization during exams
- Integrate trauma-focused therapy

**Disparities in Care:**
- Pain dismissed ("it's in your head")
- Diagnostic delays for endometriosis (average 7-10 years)
- Racial disparities in pain treatment
- Access to multidisciplinary care

**Evidence Synthesis - Challenging Questions:**

*Laparoscopy for Negative Imaging:*
- May identify endometriosis, adhesions
- Normal laparoscopy in 30-40%
- Counsel about potential findings and treatments

*Hysterectomy Outcomes:*
- With clear pathology: 70-90% improvement
- Without clear pathology: Much lower success
- Careful patient selection and counseling

*Opioids:*
- No evidence for efficacy in CPP
- Risk of dependence, hyperalgesia
- May occasionally use short-term for acute flares

**Program Development:**

*Interdisciplinary Team:*
- Gynecologist, urologist, GI specialist
- Pelvic floor physical therapist
- Pain psychologist
- Pain physician/anesthesiologist
- Nurse coordinator

*Program Components:*
- Comprehensive evaluation
- Patient education
- Physical therapy
- Psychological intervention
- Medical management optimization
- Self-management strategies

**Patient Communication:**

*Key Messages:*
- "I believe your pain is real"
- Multiple factors usually contribute
- Cure may not be possible; improvement is
- Active participation needed
- Treatment takes time

*Shared Decision-Making:*
- Discuss all options including observation
- Explore patient goals and values
- Surgery is not always the answer
- Document discussions`,
