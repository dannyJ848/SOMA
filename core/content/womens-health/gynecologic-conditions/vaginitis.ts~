      summary: 'Vaginitis is irritation or infection of the vagina causing discharge, itching, or odor. The three main types are yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis.',
      explanation: `**Types of Vaginitis:**

*Yeast Infection:*
- Thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge
- Intense itching
- NOT sexually transmitted
- Very common

*Bacterial Vaginosis (BV):*
- Thin, grayish discharge
- Fishy odor (especially after sex)
- May have no symptoms
- NOT a true infection, but imbalance

*Trichomoniasis (Trich):*
- Yellow-green, frothy discharge
- Strong odor
- IS sexually transmitted
- Partners need treatment

**When to See a Doctor:**
- First-time symptoms
- Symptoms don't improve with treatment
- Frequent infections
- Fever or pelvic pain
- During pregnancy

**Prevention Tips:**
- Avoid douching
- Wear cotton underwear
- Avoid scented products near vagina
- Wipe front to back
- Practice safe sex`,

      explanation: `**Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC):**

*Features:*
- Thick, white, "cottage cheese" discharge
- Vulvar/vaginal pruritus (intense)
- Burning, especially with urination
- Vulvar erythema, edema
- Normal vaginal pH (<4.5)

*Diagnosis:*
- Wet mount: Yeast or pseudohyphae
- Culture if recurrent or treatment failure
- KOH prep enhances visualization

*Treatment:*
- Uncomplicated: OTC azoles (miconazole, clotrimazole)
- Single dose fluconazole 150 mg PO
- Partner treatment not needed

**Bacterial Vaginosis (BV):**

*Features:*
- Thin, gray-white, homogeneous discharge
- Fishy odor (positive whiff test)
- Minimal irritation
- Elevated vaginal pH (>4.5)

*Diagnosis (Amsel Criteria - 3 of 4):*
- Thin, homogeneous discharge
- Clue cells on wet mount
- pH >4.5
- Positive whiff test (KOH)

*Treatment:*
- Metronidazole 500 mg BID x 7 days (or gel)
- Clindamycin cream
- Partner treatment not recommended
- High recurrence rate

**Trichomoniasis:**

*Features:*
- Yellow-green, frothy, malodorous discharge
- Vulvovaginal irritation
- Strawberry cervix (petechiae)
- May be asymptomatic
- Elevated pH (>4.5)

*Diagnosis:*
- Wet mount: Motile trichomonads (low sensitivity)
- NAAT testing (preferred - higher sensitivity)

*Treatment:*
- Metronidazole 2g single dose (or 500 mg BID x 7 days)
- Partner MUST be treated
- STI screening recommended
- Avoid alcohol with metronidazole`,

      summary: 'Vaginitis evaluation requires systematic assessment with office testing, understanding of vaginal ecosystem, and management of recurrent infections with attention to predisposing factors.',
      explanation: `**Vaginal Ecosystem:**

*Normal Flora:*
- Lactobacillus species predominate
- Produce lactic acid, maintain pH 3.5-4.5
- Produce hydrogen peroxide
- Competitive inhibition of pathogens

*Disruption Factors:*
- Antibiotics
- Douching
- Sexual activity
- Hormonal changes
- Immunosuppression

**Office Evaluation:**

*Vaginal pH:*
- Normal: 3.8-4.5
- Elevated (>4.5): BV, trichomoniasis, atrophic vaginitis
- Normal: Candidiasis

*Wet Mount:*
- Saline prep: Clue cells (BV), trichomonads, WBCs
- KOH prep: Yeast, pseudohyphae; whiff test

*Point-of-Care Tests:*
- Rapid antigen tests for trichomoniasis
- DNA probe tests (Affirm)
- pH/amine testing combinations

**Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC):**

*Definition:*
- ≥4 episodes per year (with documented diagnosis)

*Predisposing Factors:*
- Uncontrolled diabetes
- Immunosuppression
- Antibiotic use
- Non-albicans species

*Management:*
- Induction: 10-14 days fluconazole (or topical)
- Suppression: Fluconazole 150 mg weekly x 6 months
- Culture to identify species (non-albicans may be resistant)
- Screen for diabetes if frequent

**Recurrent BV:**

*Risk Factors:*
- Multiple/new partners
- Lack of condom use
- Vaginal douching
- Smoking

*Management:*
- Longer initial treatment course
- Suppressive therapy (metronidazole gel twice weekly)
- Limited evidence for probiotics
- Partner treatment not shown to help

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Atrophic vaginitis
- Allergic/irritant vaginitis
- Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis
- Foreign body
- Cervicitis (chlamydia, gonorrhea)`,

      summary: 'Advanced vaginitis management addresses treatment failures, resistant organisms, special populations (pregnancy, immunocompromised), and emerging therapies including microbiome restoration.',
      explanation: `**Treatment-Resistant Cases:**

*Candida:*
- Non-albicans species (C. glabrata, C. krusei)
- Azole resistance testing
- Alternative treatments:
  - Boric acid 600 mg vaginal capsule x 14 days
  - Flucytosine cream
  - Amphotericin B

*Trichomoniasis:*
- Nitroimidazole resistance (rare but increasing)
- Higher dose regimens: Metronidazole 2g daily x 7 days
- Tinidazole may be more effective
- CDC consultation for resistant cases

**Pregnancy Considerations:**

*BV:*
- Associated with preterm birth, PROM, chorioamnionitis
- Screen and treat in high-risk pregnancies
- Metronidazole or clindamycin safe in pregnancy

*Candidiasis:*
- Topical azoles only (not oral fluconazole)
- 7-day courses preferred
- More common in pregnancy

*Trichomoniasis:*
- Associated with preterm birth, low birth weight
- Treat: Metronidazole 2g single dose
- May treat in any trimester

**HIV and Immunocompromised:**

*VVC:*
- More frequent and severe
- Recurrent infections common
- Non-albicans species more common
- May need prolonged suppression

*BV:*
- Increases HIV transmission risk
- May affect vaginal microbicide efficacy

**Emerging Approaches:**

*Microbiome Restoration:*
- Vaginal probiotics (Lactobacillus)
- Limited evidence currently
- LACTIN-V trial promising for BV prevention

*Biofilm Disruption:*
- BV involves biofilm formation
- May explain recurrence
- Biofilm-disrupting agents in research

*Boric Acid:*
- First-line for non-albicans Candida
- May be adjunct for recurrent BV
- 600 mg vaginal suppository

**Desquamative Inflammatory Vaginitis:**
- Purulent discharge, pH >4.5
- Epithelial cell shedding
- Responds to clindamycin cream
- Often underdiagnosed`,

      summary: 'Expert vaginitis management involves addressing diagnostic uncertainty, counseling through recurrence, understanding vaginal microbiome science, and managing atypical presentations.',
      explanation: `**Diagnostic Challenges:**

*Mixed Infections:*
- Candida + BV common (10-20%)
- Treat both simultaneously
- May explain treatment "failures"

*Atypical Presentations:*
- Candida without classic discharge
- BV without odor
- Vulvar symptoms without vaginitis
- Consider vulvodynia, dermatoses

*Overdiagnosis of Yeast:*
- Only 30% of self-treated patients have candidiasis
- Consider contact dermatitis, vulvodynia
- Office diagnosis before recurrent treatment

**Counseling Recurrent Infections:**

*Patient Frustration:*
- Validate impact on quality of life
- Sexual relationship effects
- Explain recurrence biology
- Set realistic expectations

*Partner Concerns:*
- BV: Partner treatment doesn't help (not STI)
- Trich: Partner MUST be treated
- Candida: Not sexually transmitted

*Behavioral Modifications:*
- Limited evidence for many recommendations
- Avoiding douching (clear benefit)
- Probiotics (insufficient evidence)
- Diet changes (no strong evidence)

**Vaginal Microbiome Science:**

*Current Understanding:*
- Lactobacillus dominance = health
- Community state types (CSTs)
- Diverse microbiomes may be normal in some

*Research Directions:*
- Microbiome transplantation
- Targeted probiotics
- Biofilm disruption
- Bacteriophage therapy

**Vulvovaginal Symptoms Without Infection:**

*Consider:*
- Vulvodynia
- Contact dermatitis
- Lichen sclerosus/planus
- Atrophic changes
- Pudendal neuralgia

*Approach:*
- Thorough history
- Careful examination
- Don't reflexively treat for "yeast"
- Dermatology/vulvar specialty referral

**Special Populations:**

*Postmenopausal:*
- Atrophic vaginitis common
- Vaginal estrogen treatment
- pH elevated (different from BV)
- May have superimposed infections

*Adolescents:*
- Consider vulvovaginitis vs. vaginitis
- STI screening if sexually active
- Avoid invasive exams when possible

**Quality Improvement:**
- Ensure microscopy available and used
- Culture before repeated antifungals
- STI screening when appropriate
- Document diagnosis method`,
