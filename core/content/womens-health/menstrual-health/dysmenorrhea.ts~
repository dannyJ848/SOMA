      content: `Dysmenorrhea (dis-men-o-REE-uh) is the medical term for painful periods. It's very common - most women have some pain during their period.

**Two Types of Dysmenorrhea:**

**Primary Dysmenorrhea:**
- Normal period cramps
- Not caused by any disease
- Usually starts during teenage years
- Often improves with age

**Secondary Dysmenorrhea:**
- Caused by a reproductive condition
- Starts later in life
- May get worse over time
- Caused by conditions like endometriosis or fibroids

**What Does It Feel Like?**

Common symptoms include:
- Cramping or aching in the lower belly
- Pain that may radiate to lower back or thighs
- Dull, throbbing, or sharp pain
- May start 1-2 days before period
- Usually lasts 2-3 days

**Other symptoms that can accompany period pain:**
- Nausea or vomiting
- Diarrhea or constipation
- Headache
- Feeling tired or weak
- Dizziness

**Simple Ways to Find Relief:**

**Heat Therapy:**
- Use a heating pad on your lower belly
- Take a warm bath
- Heat helps relax muscles

**Over-the-Counter Medicine:**
- Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)
- Naproxen (Aleve)
- Take as directed, start before pain gets bad

**Lifestyle Tips:**
- Gentle exercise or walking
- Rest when you need it
- Drink plenty of water
- Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and salty foods

**When to Call a Doctor:**
- Pain so bad you miss school or work often
- Medicine doesn't help
- Pain lasts longer than 2-3 days
- You have a fever
- Pain happens when you're not on your period

**Remember:** Period pain is very common. You don't have to suffer in silence. Help is available.

      title: 'Causes and Treatment of Painful Periods',
      content: `Dysmenorrhea affects approximately 50-90% of menstruating individuals, with 10-15% experiencing severe pain that disrupts daily activities.

**Understanding the Pain Mechanism:**

**Primary Dysmenorrhea Pathophysiology:**
- Prostaglandins cause uterine contractions
- Higher prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) levels = more pain
- Uterine contractions reduce blood flow to uterus
- Reduced blood flow causes ischemia (lack of oxygen) = pain
- Pain typically begins after ovulation is established (6-12 months after menarche)

**Secondary Dysmenorrhea Causes:**

| Condition | Description | Typical Pain Pattern |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Endometriosis | Endometrial tissue outside uterus | Progressive, starts before period |
| Adenomyosis | Endometrium in uterine muscle | Deep, heavy bleeding |
| Fibroids | Benign uterine tumors | Pressure, heavy bleeding |
| Pelvic inflammatory disease | Infection of reproductive organs | New onset, often with discharge |
| Ovarian cysts | Fluid-filled sacs on ovaries | Sudden, sharp if ruptures |
| Endometrial polyps | Growths in uterine lining | Intermittent, heavy bleeding |

**Risk Factors:**
- Age <30
- Early menarche (before age 12)
- Heavy menstrual flow
- Family history of dysmenorrhea
- Smoking
- Never been pregnant
- High stress levels

**Diagnostic Approach:**

**History:**
- Age at onset (distinguishes primary vs. secondary)
- Timing of pain (with bleeding vs. throughout month)
- Character of pain (cramping vs. constant)
- Progression over time
- Response to NSAIDs
- Associated symptoms

**Physical Examination:**
- Abdominal examination
- Pelvic examination (in sexually active patients)
- Check for uterine enlargement, tenderness
- Assess for masses or nodularity

**Imaging:**
- **Pelvic ultrasound:** First-line for suspected secondary causes
- **MRI:** For complex cases, especially endometriosis

**Laboratory Tests:**
- Not typically diagnostic for primary dysmenorrhea
- May include STI testing if pelvic infection suspected
- CBC for anemia if heavy bleeding

**Treatment:**

**Primary Dysmenorrhea Treatment:**

**1. NSAIDs (First-Line)**
- Most effective treatment
- Must be taken at regular intervals
- Start 1-2 days before expected period if possible
- Options: Ibuprofen, naproxen, mefenamic acid
- Efficacy: 70-80% experience relief

**2. Hormonal Contraceptives**
- Combined oral contraceptives
- Patch, ring
- Reduce prostaglandin production
- Suppress ovulation
- May take 2-3 cycles for full effect

**3. Lifestyle Modifications:**
- Regular aerobic exercise
- Heat therapy application
- Stress management techniques
- Adequate sleep
- Dietary modifications

**4. Complementary Therapies:**
- Acupuncture
- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)
- Yoga and stretching
- Massage therapy

**Secondary Dysmenorrhea Treatment:**
- Targeted to underlying cause
- Endometriosis: Hormonal suppression, surgery
- Adenomyosis: Hormonal treatments, possible surgery
- Fibroids: Myomectomy or hysterectomy
- Infection: Appropriate antibiotics

**Red Flag Symptoms:**
- Fever with pelvic pain
- Pain not relieved by NSAIDs
- Progressive worsening over time
- Pain at times other than menstruation
- Pain with intercourse
- New onset after years of pain-free periods

      content: `Effective management of dysmenorrhea requires understanding the underlying pain mechanisms and implementing evidence-based treatment strategies.

**Primary Dysmenorrhea: Pathophysiology in Detail**

**Prostaglandin Synthesis:**
- Produced by endometrial cells during menstruation
- Synthesis increases after progesterone withdrawal
- PGF2α most potent in causing contractions
- Levels peak during first 48 hours of menses

**Uterine Activity:**
- Resting pressure: 10-15 mmHg
- Dysmenorrhea: Contractions 400+ mmHg
- Contractions last longer than normal
- Poor coordination between muscle fibers
- Result: Uterine ischemia and pain

**Pain Pathway:**
- Uterine nerve fibers transmit pain signals
- T11-L2 dermatomes (referred pain to lower back)
- Prostaglandins sensitize nerve endings
- Inflammatory mediators amplify pain response

**Clinical Assessment Tools:**

**Pain Scales:**
- Visual Analog Scale (VAS): 0-10 scale
- Verbal Descriptor Scale: Mild, moderate, severe
- Menstrual Distress Questionnaire
- McGill Pain Index

**Functional Assessment:**
- School/work days missed
- Activity limitations
- Sleep disruption
- Quality of life impact

**Treatment Algorithms:**

**Primary Dysmenorrhea:**


NSAIDs (first-line)
   ↓
If inadequate or contraindicated
   ↓
Add hormonal contraception
   ↓
If still inadequate
   ↓
Consider secondary causes


**NSAID Dosing Strategies:**

| Medication | Loading Dose | Maintenance | Interval |
|------------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Ibuprofen | 400-600 mg | 200-400 mg | q4-6h |
| Naproxen | 500 mg | 250-500 mg | q8-12h |
| Mefenamic acid | 500 mg | 250 mg | q6h |
| Diclofenac | 50 mg | 25-50 mg | q8h |

**Key NSAID Principles:**
- Pre-treat before pain escalates
- Maintain therapeutic levels throughout period
- Take with food to reduce GI side effects
- Consider topical formulations for systemic risk reduction

**Hormonal Management:**

**Combined Hormonal Contraceptives:**
- Suppress endometrial prostaglandin production
- Reduce menstrual flow by 40-50%
- Decrease uterine contractility
- Continuous/extended cycling for severe cases
- Effect: 70-80% improvement

**Levonorgestrel IUD:**
- Particularly effective for dysmenorrhea
- Reduces prostaglandin synthesis
- Thins endometrium
- 80-90% report improvement
- Additional benefit: contraception

**Other Hormonal Options:**
- Progestin-only pills
- Contraceptive implant
- Depo-medroxyprogesterone
- Vaginal ring

**Secondary Dysmenorrhea Evaluation:**

**Targeted Testing Based on Suspicion:**
- **Endometriosis:** Laparoscopy (gold standard), CA-125 (limited utility)
- **Adenomyosis:** MRI (more sensitive than ultrasound)
- **Fibroids:** Pelvic ultrasound
- **Infection:** STI testing, cervical cultures
- **Adenomyosis:** MRI with specific protocols

**Laparoscopy Indications:**
- Failed medical therapy
- Suspected endometriosis
- Adnexal mass on imaging
- Chronic pelvic pain beyond menses

**Special Considerations:**

**Adolescents:**
- Higher prevalence of primary dysmenorrhea
- Rule out obstructive anomalies if never sexually active
- Consider Müllerian anomalies if primary dysmenorrhea refractory

**Women Trying to Conceive:**
- Avoid hormonal suppression
- NSAIDs may be used (limit duration)
- Treat underlying condition if secondary

**Endometriosis-Specific Treatment:**
- Combined hormonal contraceptives
- Progestin therapies
- GnRH agonists/antagonists
- Aromatase inhibitors
- Surgical excision
