      content: `A period is part of the menstrual cycle. It's when blood and tissue from the uterus leave the body through the vagina.

**Key Points:**
- A period usually happens once a month
- It typically lasts 3-7 days
- Most girls get their first period between ages 10-15
- Periods are a normal part of growing up

**What to Expect:**
- You may see red or brown blood
- You might feel cramps in your lower belly
- You can use pads, tampons, or menstrual cups
- It's normal for periods to be irregular at first

Remember: Everyone's cycle is different. What's normal for you might be different from your friends.`,

      title: 'Understanding the Menstrual Cycle',
      content: `The menstrual cycle is a monthly series of changes your body goes through to prepare for a possible pregnancy. It's controlled by hormones and typically lasts about 28 days, though anywhere from 21-35 days is normal.

**The Four Phases:**

1. **Menstruation (Days 1-5)**
   - The lining of the uterus sheds
   - This is when you have your period
   - Bleeding typically lasts 3-7 days

2. **Follicular Phase (Days 1-13)**
   - Your body prepares to release an egg
   - Hormone levels increase
   - You may feel more energetic

3. **Ovulation (Day 14)**
   - An egg is released from the ovary
   - This is when you're most fertile
   - Some people feel mild pain called mittelschmerz

4. **Luteal Phase (Days 15-28)**
   - The body prepares for possible pregnancy
   - If pregnancy doesn't occur, the cycle restarts
   - PMS symptoms may occur during this time

**Tracking Your Cycle:**
- Use a calendar, app, or journal
- Note when your period starts and ends
- Track any symptoms or mood changes
- This helps you understand what's normal for you`,

      title: 'Hormonal Regulation of the Menstrual Cycle',
      content: `The menstrual cycle is a complex process regulated by the interaction of several hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and ovaries. This is known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis.

**Key Hormones Involved:**

1. **Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH)**
   - Produced by the hypothalamus
   - Stimulates the release of FSH and LH
   - Pulsatile secretion pattern

2. **Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH)**
   - Released by the pituitary gland
   - Stimulates follicle development in the ovaries
   - Highest during the follicular phase

3. **Luteinizing Hormone (LH)**
   - Released by the pituitary gland
   - Triggers ovulation
   - Surges mid-cycle to release the egg

4. **Estrogen**
   - Produced by developing follicles
   - Builds up the uterine lining
   - Peaks just before ovulation
   - Causes LH surge

5. **Progesterone**
   - Produced by the corpus luteum after ovulation
   - Maintains the uterine lining
   - Rises during the luteal phase
   - Decreases if pregnancy doesn't occur, triggering menstruation

**Hormonal Changes Throughout the Cycle:**

- **Follicular Phase:** FSH and estrogen rise
- **Ovulation:** LH surge and estrogen peak
- **Luteal Phase:** Progesterone rises, estrogen declines
- **Menstruation:** All hormones drop if no pregnancy occurs

**Feedback Loops:**
- Estrogen has positive feedback on LH before ovulation
- Progesterone has negative feedback on FSH and LH
- This regulation ensures proper timing of ovulation`,

      title: 'Menstrual Cycle Physiology and Pathophysiology',
      content: `The menstrual cycle involves complex physiological processes that prepare the female reproductive system for potential pregnancy each month. Understanding these mechanisms helps identify when variations may indicate underlying pathology.

**Follicular Development:**

Each cycle begins with recruitment of a cohort of follicles under FSH stimulation. Through a process of selection and atresia, typically one dominant follicle emerges. The granulosa cells in this follicle produce increasing amounts of estradiol.

- **Antral follicle count** indicates ovarian reserve
- **Dominant follicle** typically reaches 18-24mm before ovulation
- **Atresia** eliminates non-dominant follicles

**Endometrial Changes:**

The endometrium undergoes characteristic changes throughout the cycle:

1. **Proliferative Phase (Days 6-14)**
   - Endometrium thickens from 1-2mm to 3-5mm
   - Glands elongate and spiral arteries develop
   - Estrogen-driven growth

2. **Secretory Phase (Days 15-28)**
   - Endometrium reaches 5-6mm
   - Glands become secretory and tortuous
   - Stromal edema develops
   - Progesterone-driven transformation

**Ovulatory Mechanism:**

The LH surge is triggered by:
1. Estrogen reaching threshold levels (~200 pg/mL for 50 hours)
2. Positive feedback on the pituitary
3. Rise in prostaglandins and inflammatory mediators
4. Enzymatic breakdown of the follicular wall

**Luteal Phase Dynamics:**

After ovulation:
- Corpus luteum forms from remaining follicular cells
- Produces progesterone (10-30 ng/mL) and some estrogen
- Lifespan is 14 days unless rescued by hCG
- If no pregnancy, becomes corpus albicans

**Cycle Variations and Abnormalities:**

- **Luteal Phase Defect:** Inadequate progesterone production
- **Anovulatory Cycles:** Failure to ovulate, common in perimenopause
- **Follicular Persistence:** Failure of dominant follicle to rupture
- **Short Luteal Phase:** <11 days from ovulation to menstruation`,

      title: 'Advanced Menstrual Cycle Endocrinology',
      content: `The menstrual cycle represents a sophisticated interplay of neuroendocrine mechanisms that integrate hypothalamic, pituitary, and ovarian functions with peripheral tissue sensitivity and metabolic influences.

**Hypothalamic Control:**

GnRH neurons in the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area exhibit pulsatile secretion patterns:
- **Frequency-dependent regulation:** Slow pulses favor FSH secretion; fast pulses favor LH
- **Kisspeptin neurons** are the primary upstream regulators of GnRH
- **Neurokinin B and dynorphin** (KNDy neurons) modulate pulse frequency
- **Glutamate and GABA** provide excitatory and inhibitory inputs

**Molecular Mechanisms of Folliculogenesis:**

FSH receptor activation leads to:
- cAMP-PKA pathway activation
- Aromatase induction → estradiol synthesis
- IGF-1 and amphiregulin production
- Granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation

LH receptor activation in theca cells:
- Cholesterol side-chain cleavage (CYP11A1)
- 17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (CYP17) activity
- Androstenedione production (substrate for estrogen synthesis)

**The Two-Gonadotropin Two-Cell Theory:**

1. **Theca cells:** LH → androstenedione
2. **Granulosa cells:** FSH → aromatase → androstenedione → estradiol

This explains why both FSH and LH are required for normal estrogen production.

**LH Surge Mechanism:**

The preovulatory LH surge involves:
1. **Estrogen threshold** reaching critical levels
2. **Upregulation of GnRH receptors** on gonadotropes
3. **Increased GnRH pulse frequency**
4. **Self-priming effect** of GnRH
5. **Activation of progesterone receptors** in the hypothalamus

**Steroid Feedback Mechanisms:**

**Estrogen Feedback:**
- Negative feedback: Low-dose, continuous administration
- Positive feedback: High levels for sustained period (50 hours)
- Involves ERα in the hypothalamus

**Progesterone Feedback:**
- Negative feedback on LH pulse frequency
- Mediated through PR neurons in the arcuate nucleus
- Requires prior estrogen priming

**Clinical Implications:**

- **Kallmann Syndrome:** GnRH deficiency due to failed neuronal migration
- **PCOS:** Altered GnRH pulse frequency → increased LH:FSH ratio
- **Hypothalamic Amenorrhea:** Reduced kisspeptin signaling from energy deficit
- **Menopausal Transition:** Follicle depletion → loss of inhibin A → rising FSH`,
