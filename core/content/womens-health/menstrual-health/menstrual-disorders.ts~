      content: `Menstrual disorders are problems with your period. They can make your periods irregular, painful, or unusually heavy or light.

**Common Types of Menstrual Disorders:**

1. **Irregular Periods**
   - Periods that come too often or not often enough
   - Periods that are unpredictable
   - Skipping periods

2. **Heavy Periods**
   - Needing to change protection every hour
   - Passing large blood clots
   - Periods lasting more than 7 days

3. **Painful Periods**
   - Severe cramping
   - Pain that doesn't go away with medicine
   - Pain that keeps you from normal activities

4. **Absent Periods**
   - Not having a period by age 15
   - Not having a period for 3+ months (not pregnant)

**When to See a Doctor:**
- Your periods suddenly change
- You have very heavy bleeding
- You have severe pain
- You go 3+ months without a period
- You bleed between periods

Remember: Most menstrual problems can be treated. A doctor can help find what's causing the issue.`,

      content: `Menstrual disorders require systematic evaluation using the PALM-COEIN classification system developed by FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics).

**FIGO PALM-COEIN Classification:**

**Structural Causes (PALM):**
- **P**olyps (endometrial or cervical)
- **A**denomyosis (endometrial tissue in uterine muscle)
- **L**eiomyoma (fibroids)
- **M**alignancy or hyperplasia

**Non-Structural Causes (COEIN):**
- **C**oagulopathy (bleeding disorders)
- **O**vulatory dysfunction
- **E**ndometrial dysfunction
- **I**atrogenic (medications, IUD)
- **N**ot yet classified

**Diagnostic Evaluation:**

**History Taking:**
- Detailed menstrual history (cycle length, duration, flow)
- Age at menarche
- Sexual history and contraceptive use
- Medical and surgical history
- Medication review
- Symptoms of systemic disease

**Physical Examination:**
- BMI and vital signs
- Thyroid examination
- Abdominal and pelvic examination
- Signs of androgen excess (hirsutism, acne)

**Laboratory Tests:**
- **CBC:** Check for anemia from heavy bleeding
- **TSH:** Thyroid function
- **Prolactin:** Exclude pituitary issues
- **FSH/LH:** Evaluate ovarian function
- **Androgens:** Rule out PCOS
- **Iron studies:** Assess iron deficiency

**Imaging:**
- **Pelvic ultrasound:** First-line imaging
- **Saline infusion sonohysterography:** Evaluate uterine cavity
- **MRI:** For complex cases or adenomyosis
- **Hysteroscopy:** Direct visualization of uterine cavity

**Ovulatory Dysfunction Mechanisms:**

Anovulation leads to unopposed estrogen stimulation:
- No corpus luteum formation
- No progesterone production
- Proliferative endometrium continues growing
- Eventually outgrows blood supply → irregular shedding

**Common Anovulatory Causes:**
- PCOS (androgen excess, insulin resistance)
- Hypothalamic suppression (stress, exercise, weight)
- Perimenopause (follicle depletion)
- Thyroid disorders
- Hyperprolactinemia`,

      title: 'Management and Treatment Approaches',
      content: `Treatment of menstrual disorders is tailored to the underlying cause, patient's reproductive goals, and severity of symptoms. A stepwise approach is often employed.

**Pharmacologic Management:**

**Hormonal Therapies:**
1. **Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (CHC)**
   - Oral contraceptive pills (monophasic, multiphasic)
   - Contraceptive patch
   - Vaginal ring
   - Mechanism: Suppress ovulation, stabilize endometrium
   - Efficacy: 90% reduction in menstrual blood loss

2. **Progestin-Only Therapies**
   - Oral progestins (norethindrone, medroxyprogesterone)
   - Levonorgestrel IUD (52mg)
   - Progestin implant
   - Mechanism: Decidualize endometrium, reduce proliferation
   - LNG-IUD: 70-90% reduction in bleeding, 20% amenorrhea rate

3. **GnRH Agonists**
   - Leuprolide, goserelin
   - Creates temporary menopausal state
   - Limited to 6-month use due to bone loss
   - Add-back therapy extends duration

4. **Non-Hormonal Options:**
   - **Tranexamic acid:** Antifibrinolytic, reduces flow by 30-50%
   - **NSAIDs:** Reduce prostaglandins, decrease flow by 20-40%
   - **Desmopressin:** For bleeding disorders

**Surgical Interventions:**

**Uterine-Sparing Procedures:**
1. **Endometrial Ablation**
   - Thermal, radiofrequency, or cryoablation
   - 60-80% achieve amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea
   - Contra-indicated if future fertility desired

2. **Myomectomy**
   - Hysteroscopic for submucosal fibroids
   - Laparoscopic or abdominal for intramural/subserosal
   - Preserves fertility

3. **Polypectomy**
   - Hysteroscopic removal
   - Low recurrence rate

**Definitive Surgery:**
- **Hysterectomy:** Removal of uterus
- Indications: Failed conservative management, malignancy
- Routes: Vaginal, laparoscopic, robotic, abdominal
- Permanent solution for AUB

**Condition-Specific Approaches:**

**PCOS:**
- Combined hormonal contraception
- Metformin for insulin resistance
- Lifestyle modifications
- Anti-androgens for hirsutism

**Endometriosis:**
- CHC or progestin-only
- GnRH agonists/antagonists
- Aromatase inhibitors (adjunct)
- Surgical excision

**Adenomyosis:**
- CHC (may be less effective)
- LNG-IUD (first-line)
- GnRH agonists
- Hysterectomy (definitive)

**Bleeding Disorders:**
- Tranexamic acid
- Desmopressin for von Willebrand disease
- Factor replacement for hemophilia
- Avoid NSAIDs (can worsen bleeding)

**Fertility Considerations:**
- Ovulation induction for anovulation (letrozole, clomiphene)
- Myomectomy for cavity-distorting fibroids
- Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis for Asherman syndrome
- Surgical management of endometriosis`,

      content: `Complex menstrual disorders require nuanced understanding of endocrine interactions, comorbidities, and individualized treatment approaches.

**Molecular Mechanisms of Abnormal Bleeding:**

**Endometrial Angiogenesis:**
- VEGF upregulation in heavy bleeding
- Abnormal vessel architecture
- Increased endothelial proliferation
- Dysregulated prostaglandin ratios (↑PGE2, ↓PGF2α)

**Local Fibrinolytic Activity:**
- ↑Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)
- ↑Plasminogen activators
- Impaired hemostasis
- Enhanced tissue breakdown

**Inflammatory Pathways:**
- COX-2 overexpression
- Leukocyte infiltration
- Cytokine-mediated effects
- Prostaglandin-induced uterine contractions

**Special Population Considerations:**

**Adolescents:**
- Immature HPO axis → anovulatory cycles common
- 60-80% of cycles anovulatory in first year post-menarche
- Evaluation if not ovulatory by 2-3 years post-menarche
- Consider bleeding disorders if severe (von Willebrand disease prevalence 13%)

**Perimenopause:**
- Follicle depletion → rising FSH
- Shortened follicular phase → shorter cycles initially
- Eventually becomes anovulatory → irregular cycles
- Consider endometrial sampling if risk factors present

**Athletes (Female Athlete Triad):**
- Low energy availability
- Menstrual dysfunction
- Decreased bone mineral density
- Treatment: Increase energy intake, reduce exercise, consider transdermal estrogen

**Patients with Bleeding Disorders:**
- **von Willebrand Disease:** Most common inherited bleeding disorder
- **Platelet function disorders:** aspirin use, uremia
- **Factor deficiencies:** hemophilia carriers
- Multidisciplinary management with hematology

**Refractory Cases:**

**Ulipristal Acetate:**
- Selective progesterone receptor modulator
- For fibroid-related bleeding
- Liver toxicity concerns limits use

**Elagolix:**
- GnRH antagonist
- Add-back therapy included
- For endometriosis-associated pain

**Relugolix Combination Therapy:**
- GnRH antagonist with estradiol/progesterone add-back
- For heavy menstrual bleeding associated with fibroids

**Future Directions:**
- Targeted anti-angiogenic therapy
- Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs)
- Personalized medicine based on genetic profiling
- Endometrial microbiome research

**Quality of Life Considerations:**
- Menstrual disorders impact work productivity
- Associated with increased healthcare costs
- Psychological effects: anxiety, depression
- Social implications: activity limitations

- CBC every 3-6 months while on treatment
- Bone density with prolonged GnRH use
