      title: 'Treatment Approaches for PMDD',
      content: `PMDD requires comprehensive treatment that addresses both physical and psychological symptoms. A combination of pharmacological, behavioral, and lifestyle interventions is often most effective.

**First-Line Treatments:**

**1. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs)**

These are the most effective treatment for PMDD:

| Medication | Dosing | Efficacy |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Sertraline | 50-150 mg/day | 60-75% |
| Fluoxetine | 10-20 mg/day | 60-70% |
| Paroxetine CR | 12.5-25 mg/day | 65-75% |
| Escitalopram | 10-20 mg/day | 60-70% |
| Citalopram | 20-40 mg/day | 55-65% |

**Dosing Strategies:**
- **Continuous:** Daily throughout cycle
- **Luteal phase only:** Starting 14 days before menses
- **Semicontinuous:** Beginning at ovulation through menses

Luteal dosing is effective for most women and reduces side effects.

**2. Hormonal Contraceptives**

**Combined Oral Contraceptives (COCs):**
- Suppress ovulation and hormonal fluctuations
- Certain pills approved specifically for PMDD
- Drospirenone/EE formulations show best evidence
- May take 2-3 cycles to see full benefit

**Other Hormonal Options:**
- Vaginal ring
- Contraceptive patch
- Some extended-cycle formulations

**Second-Line Treatments:**

**GnRH Agonists:**
- Leuprolide, goserelin
- Create temporary menopause
- Add-back therapy required
- Reserved for severe, treatment-resistant cases

**Non-Pharmacological Treatments:**

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**
- 8-12 weekly sessions
- Learn coping strategies
- Challenge negative thoughts
- 40-50% improvement rates

**Lifestyle Modifications:**

| Intervention | Recommendation | Evidence |
|--------------|----------------|----------|
| Aerobic exercise | 30 min, 3x/week | Strong |
| Sleep hygiene | Regular schedule | Moderate |
| Stress reduction | Daily practice | Moderate |
| Dietary changes | Complex carbs, reduced salt | Limited |
| Supplements | Calcium, B6, magnesium | Moderate |

**Nutritional Supplements:**
- Calcium carbonate (1200 mg daily)
- Vitamin B6 (50-100 mg daily)
- Magnesium (200-400 mg daily)
- Vitamin E (400 IU daily)
- L-tryptophan (precursor to serotonin)

**Complementary Therapies:**
- Acupuncture
- Light therapy
- Herbal remedies (chasteberry)
- Yoga and meditation

**Treatment Selection Considerations:**

**For Women Trying to Conceive:**
- SSRIs may be continued in pregnancy
- Some SSRIs safer than others
- Non-pharmacologic options first

**For Adolescents:**
- Lifestyle modifications first-line
- SSRIs if symptoms are severe
- Careful monitoring required

**Treatment Plan Structure:**
1. Confirm diagnosis with symptom tracking
2. Begin with first-line treatment
3. Assess response after 2-3 cycles
4. Adjust or combine treatments if needed
5. Continue maintenance therapy

**What to Expect:**
- Improvement typically within 1-2 cycles
- May need to try different treatments
- Combination therapy often most effective
- Long-term management often needed

      title: 'PMDD Pathophysiology and Assessment',
      content: `PMDD represents a complex interaction between normal hormonal fluctuations and abnormal central nervous system sensitivity. Understanding these mechanisms guides targeted treatment approaches.

**Neuroendocrine Pathophysiology:**

**Serotonin System Abnormalities:**
- Reduced serotonin synthesis during luteal phase
- Decreased serotonin transporter binding
- Altered 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor sensitivity
- Tryptophan depletion triggers symptoms

**Neurosteroid Sensitivity:**
The key pathophysiological finding in PMDD is abnormal response to normal progesterone metabolites:

**Allopregnanolone Mechanism:**
- Metabolite of progesterone
- Potent positive modulator of GABA-A receptors
- Normally has calming, anxiolytic effects
- Women with PMDD have paradoxical response

**GABA-A Receptor Subunit Changes:**
- α4βδ subunits increase in luteal phase
- Changes receptor sensitivity to allopregnanolone
- Results in negative mood effects instead of calming

**Genetic Vulnerabilities:**

**ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor Alpha) Polymorphisms:**
- PvuII and XbaI variants
- Increased PMDD risk
- Affects hormone sensitivity

**5-HTTLPR (Serotonin Transporter):**
- Short (S) allele associated with PMDD
- Reduced serotonin reuptake efficiency
- Increased sensitivity to hormonal changes

**BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor):**
- Val66Met polymorphism
- Affects neuroplasticity
- Influences treatment response

**Comprehensive Assessment Protocol:**

**Initial Evaluation:**
1. **Prospective Symptom Tracking**
   - Daily ratings for at least 2 cycles
   - DRSP (Daily Record of Severity of Problems)
   - Include symptom severity score (0-3 scale)

2. **Medical History**
   - Menstrual history
   - Previous psychiatric diagnoses
   - Current medications
   - Substance use
   - Family psychiatric history

3. **Physical Examination**
   - Complete exam to rule out other causes
   - Thyroid assessment
   - Neurological evaluation if indicated

4. **Laboratory Testing**
   - TSH, free T4
   - CBC
   - Vitamin D, B12
   - Consider hormone levels (FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone)

**Differential Diagnosis:**

| Condition | Overlapping Features | Distinguishing Features |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Major Depression | Depressed mood | Non-cyclical, no luteal phase pattern |
| Generalized Anxiety | Anxiety symptoms | Non-cyclical |
| Bipolar Disorder | Mood swings | Manic episodes, non-cyclical |
| Thyroid Disorders | Mood, fatigue | Abnormal TSH, non-cyclical |
| Perimenopause | Mood changes, irregular cycles | Age >40, rising FSH |

**Premenstrual Exacerbation:**
Many psychiatric disorders worsen premenstrually:
- Depression (30-50% worsen)
- Anxiety disorders
- Panic disorder
- Substance use disorders
- Eating disorders

**Distinguishing PMDD from Premenstrual Exacerbation:**
- PMDD: Minimal symptoms in follicular phase
- Exacerbation: Significant symptoms year-round that worsen premenstrually

**Severity Assessment Scales:**

**DRSP Scoring:**
- 0 = Not at all
- 1 = Mild
- 2 = Moderate
- 3 = Severe

PMDD criteria: 50% increase in luteal phase scores

**Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Scale (PMTS):**
- Rates physical and emotional symptoms
- Scores >70 indicate PMDD range

**Functional Impairment Assessment:**
- Work/school functioning
- Social relationships
- Family relationships
- Quality of life measures
