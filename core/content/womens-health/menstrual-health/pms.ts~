**Common PMS Symptoms:**

**Physical:**
- Bloated feeling or weight gain
- Breast tenderness
- Headaches or migraines
- Muscle or joint pain
- Acne breakouts
- Tiredness or fatigue

**Emotional:**
- Mood swings
- Feeling irritable or angry
- Feeling sad or anxious
- Trouble concentrating
- Food cravings
- Sleep problems

**When Does PMS Occur?**
- Usually 1-2 weeks before your period
- Symptoms go away once bleeding starts
- Can happen every cycle or just sometimes

**Tips to Manage PMS:**
- Get regular exercise
- Eat healthy foods, limit salt and sugar
- Get enough sleep
- Try stress-reduction techniques
- Keep a symptom diary

**When to See a Doctor:**
- If symptoms are severe
- If symptoms interfere with daily life
- If nothing seems to help

Remember: PMS is very common. You're not alone, and help is available if symptoms are bothersome.`,

      title: 'Understanding PMS Symptoms and Causes',
      content: `Premenstrual Syndrome affects up to 75% of menstruating individuals. Understanding the pattern and range of symptoms helps differentiate PMS from normal cycle-related changes.

**The Luteal Phase Connection:**

PMS occurs during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle:
- **Days 1-14 (Follicular):** Typically symptom-free for most
- **Days 15-28 (Luteal):** When PMS symptoms emerge
- **Symptom window:** Usually 5-10 days before menstruation
- **Resolution:** Within 1-3 days after period starts

**Comprehensive Symptom List:**

**Physical Symptoms (Affective):**
| Symptom | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| Bloating/weight gain | 80% |
| Breast tenderness | 70% |
| Headaches | 50% |
| Fatigue | 70% |
| Appetite changes | 60% |
| Sleep disturbance | 45% |
| Joint/muscle pain | 40% |

**Emotional Symptoms:**
| Symptom | Percentage |
|---------|------------|
| Irritability | 70% |
| Mood swings | 65% |
| Anxiety | 50% |
| Sadness/depression | 45% |
| Anger | 40% |
| Difficulty concentrating | 35% |
| Social withdrawal | 30% |

**What Causes PMS?**

**Hormonal Fluctuations:**
- Rising progesterone after ovulation
- Estrogen level changes
- Sensitivity to normal hormonal changes

**Neurotransmitter Changes:**
- Serotonin fluctuations affect mood
- GABA changes influence anxiety
- Endorphin variations impact pain perception

**Other Contributing Factors:**
- Stress
- Poor nutrition
- Lack of exercise
- Sleep deprivation
- Certain nutritional deficiencies

**Risk Factors:**
- Age: Late 20s to 40s
- Family history of PMS or depression
- History of depression or anxiety
- High stress levels

**PMS vs. Normal Cycle Changes:**

Not all cycle-related symptoms are PMS:
- True PMS symptoms are consistently timed
- Symptoms must cause some impairment
- Should be documented for at least 2-3 cycles
- Must have a symptom-free phase (follicular)

**Tracking Your Symptoms:**
Keep a daily log for 2-3 months noting:
- Day of cycle
- Physical symptoms
- Emotional symptoms
- Severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- Impact on daily activities`,

      title: 'Pathophysiology and Neuroendocrine Mechanisms',
      content: `The pathophysiology of PMS involves complex interactions between ovarian hormones, neurotransmitters, and circadian rhythms. No single abnormality has been identified; rather, PMS represents abnormal responses to normal hormonal fluctuations.

**Neuroendocrine Mechanisms:**

**Serotonin System:**
- Luteal phase decreases in serotonin synthesis
- ↓Tryptophan availability (precursor for serotonin)
- ↓Serotonin receptor binding potential
- Association with 5-HTTLPR polymorphism
- Explains SSRI efficacy

**GABAergic System:**
- Allopregnanolone (progesterone metabolite)
- Potent positive modulator of GABA-A receptors
- Luteal phase increases in allopregnanolone
- Some women have paradoxical anxiogenic response
- Explains GABAergic medication effects

**Opioid System:**
- Endorphin and enkephalin fluctuations
- Luteal phase changes in opioid tone
- Related to pain symptoms
- May contribute to food cravings

**Circadian and Melatonin:**
- Abnormal melatonin secretion patterns
- Delayed nocturnal melatonin rise
- Correlation with mood symptoms
- Sleep architecture changes

**Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis:**
- Enhanced cortisol response to stress in luteal phase
- Blunted HPA axis feedback
- Association with early life stress
- May explain stress sensitivity

**Genetic Factors:**

**Serotonin Transporter (5-HTTLPR):**
- Short allele associated with increased PMS/PMDD risk
- Reduced serotonin reuptake efficiency
- Increased sensitivity to hormonal changes

**Estrogen Receptor Polymorphisms:**
- ESR1 and ESR2 variants
- Affect hormone sensitivity
- May influence symptom profile

**CYP450 Enzymes:**
- Variations in estrogen metabolism
- Individual differences in hormone clearance

**Inflammatory Mechanisms:**
- Pro-inflammatory cytokines increase in luteal phase
- IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 fluctuations
- Associated with physical symptoms
- May explain NSAID efficacy

**GABA-A Receptor Subunit Changes:**
- α4β1δ subunit expression changes
- Altered sensitivity to allopregnanolone
- May cause paradoxical effects

**Brain Imaging Findings:**

**PET Studies:**
- Altered glucose metabolism in luteal phase
- Changes in prefrontal cortex activity
- Amygdala hyperactivity to emotional stimuli

**MRI Studies:**
- Hippocampal volume changes
- Altered functional connectivity
- White matter microstructure differences

**Peripheral Markers:**
- Luteal phase rise in plasma allopregnanolone
- Decreased platelet serotonin uptake
- Altered β-endorphin levels
- Variable progesterone/estrogen ratios
