      explanation: `**What is Postpartum Depression?**
Postpartum depression (PPD) is more than "baby blues." It's a real medical condition that can happen after having a baby and needs treatment.

**Baby Blues vs. Postpartum Depression:**

*Baby Blues (Normal):*
- Mood swings, crying, anxiety
- Starts 2-3 days after birth
- Goes away within 2 weeks
- Affects up to 80% of new moms

*Postpartum Depression (Needs Treatment):*
- Lasts longer than 2 weeks
- More intense symptoms
- Affects ability to function
- Affects 1 in 7 mothers

**Symptoms:**
- Feeling sad, hopeless, or empty
- Crying a lot
- Difficulty bonding with your baby
- Withdrawing from family and friends
- Trouble sleeping (even when baby sleeps)
- Loss of appetite or overeating
- Overwhelming tiredness
- Feeling worthless or guilty
- Anxiety or panic attacks
- Thoughts of harming yourself or your baby

**Important:**
- PPD is NOT your fault
- It does NOT mean you're a bad mother
- Treatment works
- Getting help is the right thing to do

**When to Get Help Immediately:**
- Thoughts of hurting yourself
- Thoughts of hurting your baby
- Hearing or seeing things that aren't there
- Feeling confused or unable to care for yourself`,

      summary: 'Postpartum depression is a major depressive episode occurring within 4 weeks of delivery (DSM-5) or within a year (clinical practice), affecting mood, cognition, and maternal-infant bonding, requiring screening, prompt treatment, and attention to the mother-infant dyad.',
      explanation: `**Epidemiology:**
- Prevalence: 10-15% of new mothers
- Higher in adolescents, low-income, prior depression
- Can occur in fathers (10%) and adoptive parents

**Risk Factors:**
- History of depression or anxiety
- Previous postpartum depression
- Family history of mood disorders
- Stressful life events
- Poor social support
- Relationship problems
- Unplanned pregnancy
- Pregnancy or birth complications
- Breastfeeding difficulties

**Clinical Features:**

*DSM-5 Criteria (with peripartum onset specifier):*
- Major depressive episode criteria met
- Onset during pregnancy or within 4 weeks postpartum

*Common Symptoms:*

**Screening:**
- Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)
- Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)
- Screen at least once during perinatal period
- Question 10 of EPDS addresses self-harm

**Treatment:**
- Mild-moderate: Psychotherapy (CBT, IPT) effective
- Moderate-severe: Medication (SSRIs safe in breastfeeding)
- Severe: Combination therapy
- Brexanolone for severe cases (IV infusion)`,

      summary: 'Perinatal depression management requires differentiation from other perinatal mental health conditions, evidence-based treatment selection considering lactation, and attention to prevention in high-risk women.',
      explanation: `**Differential Diagnosis:**

*Postpartum Blues:*
- Onset day 2-3, resolves by day 10-14
- Mood lability, tearfulness
- No functional impairment
- Very common (50-80%)

*Postpartum Depression:*
- Onset within 4 weeks (DSM-5) or year (clinical)
- Persistent symptoms (≥2 weeks)
- Functional impairment
- Requires treatment

*Postpartum Anxiety Disorders:*
- GAD, panic disorder, OCD
- Often co-occur with depression

- Treatment similar

*Postpartum Psychosis:*
- Rare (1-2 per 1000)
- Onset first 2 weeks postpartum
- Confusion, disorganization, hallucinations
- Psychiatric emergency
- Hospitalization required
- Associated with bipolar disorder

**Medication in Breastfeeding:**

*SSRIs (Preferred):*
- Sertraline: Minimal infant exposure
- Paroxetine: Low breast milk levels
- Citalopram/escitalopram: Acceptable

*Other Options:*
- SNRIs: Limited data but likely safe
- Bupropion: Low levels
- Avoid long-acting benzodiazepines

*Counseling Points:*
- Benefits of breastfeeding
- Benefits of treating maternal depression
- Risks of untreated depression to infant
- Shared decision-making

**Prevention:**

*High-Risk Women:*
- History of depression/PPD
- Antidepressant during pregnancy

*Strategies:*
- Close postpartum monitoring
- Early intervention at symptoms
- Consider prophylactic antidepressant postpartum
- Psychotherapy during pregnancy

**Psychotherapy:**
- CBT: Evidence-based for perinatal depression
- IPT: Specifically adapted for perinatal period
- May be first-line for mild-moderate symptoms
- Combined with medication for severe cases`,

      summary: 'Advanced perinatal mental health care involves management of treatment-resistant cases, coordination with obstetric care, novel therapies, and addressing the impact of maternal mental health on child development.',
      explanation: `**Treatment-Resistant Cases:**

*Definition:*
- Inadequate response to 2+ adequate trials
- Consider: diagnosis, compliance, comorbidities

*Options:*
- Augmentation strategies
- Medication switch
- Intensive outpatient/partial hospital
- ECT (safe in pregnancy and postpartum)
- Brexanolone (novel IV therapy)

**Brexanolone:**
- Synthetic allopregnanolone
- IV infusion over 60 hours
- FDA approved for postpartum depression
- REMS program (in-facility monitoring)
- Rapid onset of action
- Expensive, limited access

**Electroconvulsive Therapy:**
- Safe and effective in perinatal period
- Consider for severe, treatment-resistant cases
- Psychotic features
- Imminent danger

**Pregnancy Management:**

*Preconception Counseling:*
- Risk of recurrence
- Medication continuation vs. discontinuation
- Monitoring plan

*During Pregnancy:*
- Untreated depression has risks (preterm birth, low birth weight, bonding)
- Most antidepressants safe
- SSRI-exposed newborns: Monitor for adaptation syndrome

*Medication Considerations:*
- Paroxetine: Historical cardiac concerns (current data reassuring)
- Sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram: Preferred
- Venlafaxine: Neonatal effects
- Bupropion: Lower sexual side effects

**Impact on Child Development:**

*Untreated Depression:*
- Impaired bonding
- Less responsive parenting
- Cognitive and emotional effects on child
- Long-term behavioral problems

*Treatment Benefits:*
- Improved maternal-infant interaction
- Better child outcomes
- Family functioning

**Partner and Family:**
- Paternal depression (10%)
- Impact on relationship
- Support for partner
- Family therapy when indicated`,
