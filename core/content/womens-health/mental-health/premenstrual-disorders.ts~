      explanation: `**What is PMS?**
PMS is a group of symptoms that many women experience before their period. They usually go away within a few days of your period starting.

**Common PMS Symptoms:**
- Bloating
- Breast tenderness
- Headaches
- Mood swings
- Irritability
- Fatigue
- Food cravings
- Trouble sleeping

**What is PMDD?**
PMDD is a more severe form of PMS that significantly affects daily life. It includes more intense emotional symptoms.

**PMDD Symptoms:**
- Severe mood swings
- Depression or hopelessness
- Intense anger or irritability
- Anxiety or tension
- Difficulty concentrating
- Feeling out of control

**Key Feature:**
- Symptoms happen in the 1-2 weeks BEFORE your period
- They go away within a few days of your period starting
- There should be a symptom-free time during your cycle

**Treatment Options:**
- Lifestyle changes (exercise, diet, sleep)
- Over-the-counter pain relievers
- Birth control pills (for some women)
- Antidepressants (for PMDD)`,

      summary: 'Premenstrual syndrome encompasses physical and psychological symptoms in the luteal phase, while PMDD is a severe form with predominant mood symptoms that meets specific DSM-5 criteria and significantly impairs functioning.',
      explanation: `**PMS Criteria:**

      summary: 'Premenstrual disorders result from abnormal sensitivity to normal hormonal fluctuations, with management including lifestyle modifications, SSRIs (which can be used continuously or luteal-phase only), and hormonal therapies to eliminate ovulation.',
      explanation: `**Pathophysiology:**

*Not Hormone Abnormality:*
- Hormone levels are normal
- Abnormal CNS sensitivity to normal fluctuations
- Particularly to progesterone and its metabolite allopregnanolone

*Serotonin Hypothesis:*
- Reduced serotonergic activity in luteal phase
- SSRIs effective even with intermittent dosing
- Rapid response (within 1-2 days)

*Neuroactive Steroids:*
- Allopregnanolone is GABA modulator
- Fluctuations affect mood-regulating circuits

**Evaluation:**

*Prospective Symptom Tracking:*
- Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP)
- At least 2 cycles
- 30% increase in symptoms in luteal phase
- Confirms timing pattern

*Exclude Other Conditions:*
- Major depressive disorder
- Anxiety disorders
- Thyroid disease
- Perimenopause
- Medical conditions exacerbated by menses

**Treatment - Stepwise Approach:**

*Level 1 - Lifestyle:*
- Regular exercise (aerobic)
- Dietary modifications (complex carbs, limit salt, caffeine, alcohol)
- Sleep hygiene
- Stress management
- Calcium 1000-1200 mg/day

*Level 2 - Supplements:*
- Calcium (evidence-based)
- Vitamin B6 (up to 100 mg/day)
- Chasteberry (Vitex)
- Limited evidence for evening primrose, magnesium

*Level 3 - Pharmacotherapy:*
- SSRIs (first-line for PMDD)
- Continuous or luteal-phase dosing
- Response within 1-2 cycles

*Level 4 - Hormonal:*
- Combined oral contraceptives (24/4 regimen)
- GnRH agonists (with add-back for long-term)`,

      summary: 'Advanced PMDD management addresses treatment-resistant cases, perimenopause-related symptom changes, comorbidities, and the role of surgical menopause for severe refractory cases.',
      explanation: `**SSRI Details:**

*Evidence-Based Options:*
- Fluoxetine 20 mg
- Sertraline 50-150 mg
- Paroxetine 10-30 mg
- Escitalopram 10-20 mg

*Dosing Strategies:*
- Continuous: Throughout cycle
- Luteal: Start at ovulation or symptom onset
- Symptom-onset: Only when symptoms begin

*Treatment Failure:*
- Try different SSRI
- Increase dose
- Switch to continuous dosing
- Add hormonal therapy

**Hormonal Therapies:**

*Oral Contraceptives:*
- Yaz (drospirenone/EE 20 mcg): FDA-approved for PMDD
- 24/4 regimen better than 21/7
- Extended or continuous cycling may help
- Not effective for all women

*GnRH Agonists:*
- Medical oophorectomy
- Very effective but significant side effects
- Requires add-back therapy (estrogen + progestin)
- Reserved for severe, refractory cases

*Surgical Oophorectomy:*
- Definitive treatment
- Only for severe refractory PMDD
- Requires trial of GnRH agonist first
- Long-term HRT needed if premenopausal

**Comorbidities:**

*Major Depression:*
- May coexist with PMDD
- PMDD symptoms worsen other mood disorders
- Continuous SSRI may be needed
- May need higher doses

*Anxiety Disorders:*
- Common comorbidity
- Cognitive behavioral therapy helpful
- Treat both conditions

**Perimenopause:**
- PMDD symptoms often worsen
- Irregular cycles complicate treatment
- Consider continuous hormonal therapy
- May improve after menopause

**Emerging Treatments:**

*Neurosteroid Modulators:*
- Sepranolone (PMDD-specific development)
- Blocks allopregnanolone effects
- Phase 2/3 trials

*Esketamine:*
- Rapid antidepressant
- Potential for acute symptom relief
- Research ongoing`,
