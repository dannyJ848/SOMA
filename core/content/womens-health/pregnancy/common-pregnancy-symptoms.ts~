      summary: 'Pregnancy symptoms result from hormonal changes and mechanical effects of the growing uterus, with most being self-limited and manageable with conservative measures.',
      explanation: `**Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy (NVP):**
- Affects 70-80% of pregnancies
- Peaks at 9 weeks, usually resolves by 16-20 weeks
- Cause: Likely related to hCG and estrogen
- Management: Ginger, vitamin B6, small frequent meals, bland diet
- Severe cases (hyperemesis gravidarum): Requires IV fluids, antiemetics

**Fatigue:**
- First trimester: Progesterone effects, increased metabolic demands
- Second trimester: Often improves
- Third trimester: Returns due to physical demands, sleep disruption

**Musculoskeletal Symptoms:**

*Back Pain (50-70%):*
- Lumbar lordosis increases to compensate for gravid uterus
- Relaxin hormone loosens joints
- Management: Posture, exercise, heat, acetaminophen

*Round Ligament Pain:*
- Sharp, brief, lower abdominal pain with movement
- Ligament stretching as uterus grows
- Reassurance; no treatment usually needed

**Cardiovascular Changes:**
- Blood volume increases 40-50%
- Heart rate increases 10-15 bpm
- Symptoms: Palpitations, dizziness, lower extremity edema

**Gastrointestinal:**
- Heartburn (GERD): Progesterone relaxes LES, mechanical compression
- Constipation: Progesterone slows motility
- Hemorrhoids: Increased venous pressure, constipation

**Respiratory:**
- Dyspnea: Diaphragm elevation, increased oxygen demand
- Nasal congestion: Estrogen-induced mucosal edema

**Genitourinary:**
- Urinary frequency: Early (uterus compresses bladder), late (fetal head descent)
- Physiologic hydronephrosis: Progesterone and mechanical compression`,

      summary: 'Management of pregnancy symptoms requires distinguishing normal physiologic changes from pathologic conditions, with evidence-based treatment approaches that balance maternal symptom relief with fetal safety.',
      explanation: `**Nausea/Vomiting Management Algorithm:**

*First-line:*
- Dietary modifications (frequent small meals, avoid triggers)
- Ginger 250 mg QID
- Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 10-25 mg TID

*Second-line:*
- Add doxylamine 12.5 mg QID (OTC sleep aid)
- Doxylamine/pyridoxine combo (Diclegis)

*Third-line:*
- Ondansetron 4-8 mg Q8H (low risk in second/third trimester)
- Metoclopramide 10 mg TID
- Promethazine 12.5-25 mg Q6H

*Hyperemesis Gravidarum:*
- IV fluids (NS or LR with potassium)
- Thiamine (before glucose if prolonged vomiting)
- Antiemetics per above
- Consider TPN for severe, refractory cases

**Musculoskeletal Pain Management:**

*Back Pain:*
- Physical therapy, exercise
- Pelvic support belt
- Acetaminophen (first-line analgesic in pregnancy)
- Heat therapy
- Consider chiropractic care

*Pelvic Girdle Pain:*
- More severe, affects daily function
- Physical therapy with stabilization exercises
- May benefit from sacroiliac belt

**GERD Management:**
- Lifestyle (small meals, avoid lying down after eating)
- Antacids (avoid sodium bicarbonate)
- H2 blockers (ranitidine, famotidine)
- PPIs if severe (lansoprazole, omeprazole - limited data)

**Constipation:**
- Fiber, fluids
- Docusate (stool softener)
- Polyethylene glycol (MiraLAX)
- Avoid stimulant laxatives long-term

**Leg Cramps:**
- Stretching
- Magnesium supplementation (limited evidence)
- Ensure adequate hydration`,

      summary: 'Advanced management of pregnancy symptoms requires differentiating physiologic from pathologic presentations, addressing refractory symptoms, and managing symptoms in context of comorbid conditions.',
      explanation: `**Differential Diagnosis Considerations:**

*Nausea/Vomiting Red Flags:*
- Onset after 9 weeks (consider molar pregnancy, hepatobiliary)
- Severe abdominal pain (appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis)
- Fever (infection)
- Weight loss >5% (hyperemesis severity indicator)
- Labs: Ketones, TSH (hyperthyroidism in HG), LFTs, lipase

*Back Pain Red Flags:*
- Preterm labor (regular contractions)
- Pyelonephritis (fever, costovertebral angle tenderness)
- Epidural abscess (neurologic deficits - rare)
- Vertebral osteomyelitis

*Lower Extremity Edema Red Flags:*
- Asymmetric swelling (DVT)
- Rapid onset with hypertension (preeclampsia)
- Generalized edema with proteinuria

**Hyperemesis Gravidarum Management:**

*Diagnostic Criteria:*
- Persistent vomiting not related to other causes
- Weight loss ≥5%
- Ketonuria
- Electrolyte abnormalities

*Inpatient Treatment:*
- NPO initially, clear liquids when tolerated
- IV NS with K, Mg, phosphate repletion
- Thiamine 100 mg IV daily
- Multi-antiemetic regimen
- Enteral nutrition via NG/NJ if refractory
- Parenteral nutrition for severe cases

*Wernicke Encephalopathy Prevention:*
- Thiamine before any glucose-containing fluids
- Classic triad often incomplete in pregnancy

**Medication Safety Considerations:**

*Analgesics:*
- Acetaminophen: Safe, first-line
- NSAIDs: Avoid in third trimester (ductus arteriosus closure, oligohydramnios)
- Opioids: Short-term use acceptable; neonatal withdrawal risk

*Antiemetics:*
- Ondansetron: Possible small cleft palate risk (controversial)
- Phenothiazines: Long safety record
- Metoclopramide: Limit duration (EPS risk)

*Sleep Aids:*
- Diphenhydramine: Category B
- Doxylamine: Category A, part of Diclegis`,

      summary: 'Expert management of pregnancy symptoms involves evidence synthesis for controversial treatments, management of rare complications, addressing patient preferences and values, and recognition of symptoms as potential precursors to pathologic conditions.',
      explanation: `**Evidence Synthesis - Controversial Topics:**

*Ondansetron Safety:*
- 2012 Danish study: No increased malformations
- 2019 studies: Possible 1.5x increased cleft palate risk
- Absolute risk remains small (~1 extra case per 1000 exposed)
- Individual counseling; consider timing (organogenesis complete after T1)

*Cannabis for NVP:*
- Increasing use despite lack of evidence for efficacy
- Concerns: Fetal neurodevelopment, low birth weight
- Counsel against; offer evidence-based alternatives

*Acupuncture/P6 Acupressure:*
- Some RCT support for nausea reduction
- Low risk; reasonable adjunct

**Rare Complications:**

*Ptyalism (Hypersalivation):*
- Often accompanies severe NVP
- Distressing symptom, difficult to treat
- Glycopyrrolate, atropine (limited data)
- Behavioral techniques (frequent spitting, sour candy)

*Restless Legs Syndrome:*
- Affects up to 25% of pregnancies
- Often iron deficiency related
- Check ferritin, iron studies
- Iron supplementation, leg stretches, massage
- Medications (gabapentin, low-dose opioids) for severe cases

**Longitudinal Symptom Tracking:**

*Nausea/Vomiting Atypical Patterns:*
- Late onset (>9 weeks): Molar pregnancy, hepatobiliary disease
- Persistence beyond 20 weeks: Consider hyperemesis persistence, gestational trophoblastic disease
- Recurrence late pregnancy: Acute fatty liver, HELLP

*Progressive Edema:*
- Monitor for preeclampsia development
- Carpal tunnel syndrome (edema affecting median nerve)
- Periorbital edema as preeclampsia sign

**Patient Communication:**

*Setting Expectations:*
- Normalize symptoms while validating distress
- Clear guidance on warning signs
- Shared decision-making for treatment options

*Cultural Considerations:*
- Food preferences and restrictions
- Herbal remedy safety counseling
- Traditional practices and modern medicine integration

**Quality Improvement:**

*Screening and Documentation:*
- Standardized symptom assessment (PUQE score)
- Prenatal visit templates
- Red flag protocols

*Referral Pathways:*
- Physical therapy for musculoskeletal symptoms
- GI consultation for severe GERD, hyperemesis
- Pain management for refractory cases`,
