      explanation: `**Why Start Before Pregnancy?**
The first weeks of pregnancy are critical for your baby's development - often before you know you're pregnant. Getting healthy ahead of time gives your baby the best start.

**Key Steps:**

*Take Folic Acid:*
- Start taking 400-800 micrograms daily
- Prevents serious brain and spine birth defects
- Begin at least 1 month before trying to conceive

*See Your Doctor:*
- Review any health conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure)
- Check your vaccinations
- Discuss any medications you take
- Get tested for infections

*Lifestyle Changes:*
- Stop smoking and avoid secondhand smoke
- Avoid alcohol completely
- Reach a healthy weight
- Eat nutritious foods
- Exercise regularly

*Avoid Harmful Substances:*
- Don't use recreational drugs
- Limit caffeine
- Avoid certain chemicals at work or home

**For Your Partner:**
- Healthy lifestyle matters too
- Stop smoking
- Limit alcohol
- Maintain a healthy weight`,
