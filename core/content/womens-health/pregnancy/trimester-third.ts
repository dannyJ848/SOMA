- External fetal monitors
- Records fetal heart rate and movement
| Typically 20-40 minutes |
- Performed in semi-recumbent position

**Interpretation:**

| Result | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| Reactive | ≥2 accelerations of 15 bpm for 15 sec in 20 min |
| Nonreactive | <2 accelerations in 40 min |

**Accelerators:**
- Fetal movement

- Score 0-4: Abnormal, consider delivery

**Modified BPP (NST + AFI):**
- NST reactive + AFI ≥5: reassuring

**Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR/FGR):**

**Pathophysiology:**

**Placental Insufficiency:**
- Reduced uteroplacental blood flow
| Abnormal placental development |
| Impaired nutrient transfer |
| Chronic fetal hypoxia |

**Classification:**

| Type | Timing | Pattern | Prognosis |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Early | <32 weeks | Asymmetric, head sparing | Poor |
| Late | ≥32 weeks | Symmetric | Better |

**Doppler Assessment:**

**Umbilical Artery:**
- Normal: High diastolic flow with advancing gestation
- Abnormal:
  - Increased resistance (RI, S/D ratio)
  - Absent end-diastolic flow (AEDF)
  - Reversed end-diastolic flow (REDF) - critical

**Middle Cerebral Artery:**
- Brain sparing: Decreased resistance
| MCA/UA ratio >1.08 = brain sparing |

**Ductus Venosus:**
- Critical predictor of fetal acidemia
| Absent/reversed A-wave = imminent decompensation |

**Delivery Timing:**

| Gestational Age | Doppler Findings | Recommendation |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------|
| <32 weeks | REDF UA | Consider delivery |
| 32-34 weeks | AEDF UA | Individualize |
| 34-37 weeks | Abnormal Dopplers | Consider delivery |
| ≥37 weeks | Any FGR | Delivery recommended |

**Maternal Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy:**

**Physiologic Stress of Third Trimester:**
- Cardiac output peaks (50% increase)
| Blood volume peak (40-50% increase) |
| Heart rate 10-20 bpm higher |
| Decreased SVR |

**Specific Conditions:**

**Pulmonary Hypertension:**
- High maternal mortality (30-50%)
| Contraindication to pregnancy |
- Consider termination early if diagnosed
| If continuing: |
  - Hospitalization at 20-24 weeks |
  - Multidisciplinary management |
  - Planned delivery at 34 weeks |
  - Epidural for labor (autonomic blockade) |

**Mechanical Valves:**
- Anticoagulation challenges
| Warfarin: teratogenic, safer for mother |
| Heparin: safer for fetus, less effective |
| Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) commonly used |
| Planned delivery with heparin hold |

**Peripartum Cardiomyopathy:**
- Heart failure in peripartum period
| Ejection fraction <45% |
| Diagnosis of exclusion |
| Management: |
  - Diuretics |
  - Afterload reduction |
  - Consider bromocriptine |

**Complex Multiple Gestation:**

**Monochorionic-Monoamniotic (Mono/Mono):**
- Highest risk twin pregnancy
| Cord entanglement risk |
| Twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) |
| Management: |
  - Inpatient at 26-28 weeks |
  - Daily NST/BPP |
  - Cesarean delivery at 32-34 weeks |

**Selective Fetal Growth Restriction:**
- Discordant growth in monochorionic twins
| Stage I-III classification |
| Management: |
  - Stage I: Expectant |
  - Stage II/III: Laser coagulation, cord occlusion |
  - Intensive monitoring |

**Twin Anemia-Polycythemia Sequence (TAPS):**
- Spontaneous or post-laser
| Small net transfusion through anastomoses |
| Diagnosis: MCA PSV differences |
| Treatment: Laser, IUT, or delivery |

**Fetal Anemia Management:**

**Causes:**
- Alloimmunization (Rh, Kell, etc.)
- Parvovirus B19
- Twin-twin transfusion

**Diagnosis:**
- MCA-PSV Doppler
  - Peak systolic velocity >1.5 MoM = anemia
- Confirmation with percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS)

**Treatment:**
- Intrauterine transfusion (IUT)
  - O-negative, irradiated, CMV-negative blood
  - Cordocentesis under ultrasound guidance
  - May need repeated every 1-3 weeks
| Maternal IVIG for alloimmunization |

**Preterm Prelabor Rupture of Membranes (PPROM):**

**Diagnosis:**
- History of fluid leakage
| Sterile speculum examination |
- Nitrazine test (pH >6.5) |
| Ferning pattern |
- Ultrasound: oligohydramnios |

**Management:**

**<24 weeks:**
- Counsel regarding viability
| Consider termination |
- Expectant management if continuing |

**24-33 weeks:**
- Hospitalization
| Antibiotics (latency) |
  - Erythromycin or ampicillin |
| Corticosteroids |
| Magnesium sulfate <32 weeks |
- Consider delivery at 34 weeks

**≥34 weeks:**
- Induction of labor
| Reduce GBS risk |

**Risk of Chorioamnionitis:**
- Maternal fever
| Uterine tenderness |
| Fetal tachycardia |
| Maternal/fetal leukocytosis |
- Treatment: Delivery + antibiotics

          correctAnswer: 1,
          explanation: 'At 30 weeks with absent end-diastolic flow (AEDF), management is individualized with close monitoring and consideration of delivery based on gestational age and other Doppler findings. Immediate delivery is not typically indicated at 30 weeks unless there are additional concerns.',
