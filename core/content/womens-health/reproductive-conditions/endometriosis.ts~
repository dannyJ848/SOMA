      content: `Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It can cause pain and other problems.

**What is Endometriosis?**
- Tissue similar to uterine lining grows elsewhere
| Common locations: ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, bowel
| This tissue responds to hormones just like uterine lining
| Can cause pain, scarring, and infertility

**Common Symptoms:**
| Pelvic pain (especially during periods)
| Pain with intercourse
| Heavy or irregular bleeding
| Pain with bowel movements or urination
| Infertility

**Diagnosis:**
| Medical history and symptom review
| Physical exam
| Imaging (ultrasound, MRI)
| Laparoscopy (definitive diagnosis)

**Treatment Options:**
| Pain relievers (NSAIDs)
| Hormonal therapies (birth control pills, progestins)
| Surgery to remove implants
| Lifestyle changes

**Impact on Fertility:**
| Can make it harder to get pregnant
| Many women with endometriosis can still get pregnant
| Treatment may improve fertility

**Remember:** Endometriosis is common and treatable. If you have symptoms, talk to a healthcare provider.

      title: 'Endometriosis Pathophysiology and Management',
      content: `Endometriosis is a condition where endometrial tissue implants outside the uterus, causing inflammation, pain, and scarring.

**Pathophysiology:**

**Implantation Theory:**
| Retrograde menstruation most accepted theory
| Endometrial cells flow backward through tubes
| Implant on peritoneal surfaces
| Viable tissue establishes blood supply
| Occurs in 76-90% of women

**Coelomic Metaplasia:|
| Transformation of coelomic epithelium into endometrial tissue
| Explains endometriosis in unusual locations (pleura, pericardium)
| Explains cases in girls before menarche

**Inflammation:**
| Chronic inflammatory state
| Implants produce inflammatory mediators:
  - Prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2α)
  - Cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α)
| Inflammatory infiltrates activate sensory nerves
| Causes pain and scarring

**Hormonal Response:**
| Ectopic endometrium responds to hormones
| Creates estrogen and progesterone receptors
| Cyclic bleeding causes microscopic bleeding
| Inflammation triggers fibrosis

**Clinical Presentation by Location:**

| Location | Symptoms |
|----------|----------|
| Ovarian (endometrioma) | Mass, pain, elevation of CA-125 |
| Peritoneal implants | Pelvic pain, adhesions |
| Uterosacral ligaments | Pain, nodularity |
| Bladder | Dysuria, urgency, hematuria |
| Bowel | Dyschezia, constipation, bleeding |
| Diaphragm | Shoulder pain, dyspnea |
| Vagina | Pain with intercourse, spotting |

**Diagnostic Algorithms:**

| Indication | Test | Finding |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Chronic pelvic pain | Pelvic ultrasound | May show endometriomas |
| Adnexal mass | CA-125 | May be elevated |
| Infertility | Laparoscopy | Visual confirmation |
| Suspicious mass | MRI | Deep infiltrative disease |

**Surgical Staging:**
| ASRM classification based on:
| - Superficial vs. deep implants
| - Presence/absence of adhesions
| - Endometrioma presence/size
| - Complete vs. incomplete resection

**Management:**

**Pain Management:**
| NSAIDs (naproxen, ibuprofen) - first-line
| Hormonal suppression
| Laparoscopic excision with ablation
| Hysterectomy with oophorectomy (definitive)

**Hormonal Suppression:**
| Combined oral contraceptives
| Progestin-only methods
| GnRH agonists/antagonists (add-back needed)
| Aromatase inhibitors (experimental)
| Surgical menopause (definitive)

**Fertility Considerations:**
| 30-40% of infertile women have endometriosis
| Treat with surgical excision + medical management
| IVF success rates lower if stage III/IV disease
| Consider earlier referral for ART

**Surgical Approaches:**

| Stage | Approach | Fertility Preservation |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|
| I | Excision/ablation | Preserves ovarian tissue |
| II | Excision/ablation | Preserves ovarian tissue |
| III | Excision/ablation | Can preserve some ovarian tissue |
| IV | Excision/ablation | May require oophorectomy |

| Adhesiolysis:|
| Essential for pain relief and fertility
| Prevents adhesion reformation
| Barriers used to prevent re-adhesion |
| Surgical technique critical
| Hyaluronic acid may reduce adhesions

**Stem Cell Theory:**
| Endometrial stem cells residing in endometrium
| Retrograde transport to pelvis
