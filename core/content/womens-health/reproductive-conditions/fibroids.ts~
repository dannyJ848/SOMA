      content: `Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in or on the uterus. They are very common - many women have them without knowing.

**What are Fibroids?**

Fibroids are tumors made of smooth muscle cells and fibrous connective tissue. They grow in the uterus and range in size from tiny seedlings to large masses that can distort and enlarge the uterus.

**Key Facts:**

- Fibroids are almost always benign (non-cancerous)
- They rarely develop into cancer
- Many women don't have symptoms
- They can appear at any age but are most common in women 30-40 years old
- Fibroids tend to shrink after menopause

**Types of Fibroids by Location:**

1. **Intramural** - Grow within the muscular wall of the uterus
2. **Subserosal** - Grow on the outer surface of the uterus
3. **Submucosal** - Grow into the uterine cavity

**Why Fibroids Matter:**

While many fibroids don't cause problems, they can sometimes cause:
- Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding
- Pelvic pain or pressure
- Frequent urination (if pressing on bladder)
- Difficulty getting pregnant
- Complications during pregnancy

Understanding fibroids helps you recognize when they might need treatment and when they can be safely monitored.

      title: 'Causes and Risk Factors',
      content: `Understanding why fibroids develop helps identify risk factors and potential prevention strategies.

**What Causes Fibroids?**

The exact cause of fibroids is not completely understood, but research has identified several key factors:

**Hormonal Factors:**
- **Estrogen and Progesterone** - These hormones stimulate the growth of uterine lining during each menstrual cycle, and they also appear to promote fibroid growth
- Fibroids contain more estrogen and progesterone receptors than normal uterine muscle cells
- Fibroids tend to grow when hormone levels are high (during reproductive years)
- They shrink when hormone levels decrease (after menopause)

**Genetic Factors:**
- Fibroids appear to run in families
- Having a close relative with fibroids increases your risk
- Specific gene mutations have been identified in fibroid cells
- Identical twins are more likely to both have fibroids than fraternal twins

**Growth Factors:**
- Insulin-like growth factor may affect fibroid growth
- Other growth substances that help the body maintain tissues may promote fibroid development

**Extracellular Matrix:**
- Fibroids have increased amounts of extracellular matrix (the material that makes cells stick together)
- This matrix stores growth factors and causes fibroid cells to respond differently to hormones

**Risk Factors for Developing Fibroids:**

**Risk Factors You Cannot Change:**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Age | Most common in women 30-40 years old |
| Race | African American women are 2-3 times more likely to develop fibroids |
| Family History | Having a mother or sister with fibroids increases risk |
| Genetic Predisposition | Certain genetic mutations increase susceptibility |
| Early Menarche | Starting periods at a young age increases exposure to hormones |

**Risk Factors You Can Potentially Modify:**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Diet High in Red Meat | May increase fibroid risk |
| Alcohol Consumption | Particularly beer appears to increase risk |
| Vitamin D Deficiency | Low vitamin D levels are associated with fibroids |
| Obesity | Higher body weight increases estrogen production |
| Stress | Chronic stress may affect hormone balance |

**Protective Factors:**

- **Pregnancy** - Having children seems protective
- **Oral Contraceptives** - Lower dose birth control pills may reduce risk
- **Vegetarian Diet** - Plant-based diets associated with lower risk
- **Exercise** - Regular physical activity may reduce risk
- **Vitamin D** - Adequate levels appear protective

**Racial Disparities:**

African American women are disproportionately affected by fibroids:
- Develop fibroids at younger ages
- Have larger and more numerous fibroids
- Experience more severe symptoms
- Are more likely to need surgical treatment
- May have different genetic factors contributing to development

**Hormonal Influence:**

The relationship between hormones and fibroids explains:
- Why fibroids grow during reproductive years
- Why they rarely appear before puberty
- Why they typically shrink after menopause
- Why they can grow rapidly during pregnancy (when hormones are high)

      title: 'Treatment Options',
      content: `Treatment for fibroids ranges from watchful waiting to surgical removal, depending on symptoms, fibroid characteristics, and patient goals.

**Treatment Decision Factors:**

When deciding on treatment, doctors consider:
- Severity and type of symptoms
- Size, number, and location of fibroids
- Age and how close to menopause
- Future fertility desires
- Overall health and medical history
- Patient preferences and quality of life concerns

**Watchful Waiting (Expectant Management)**

**Indications:**
- Small, asymptomatic fibroids
- Approaching menopause
- Mild symptoms that don't interfere with daily life
- Pregnancy or trying to conceive (fibroids often monitored)

**What it involves:**
- Regular pelvic exams
- Periodic ultrasounds to monitor growth
- Tracking symptoms
- Addressing symptoms as they arise

**Medical Management:**

**GnRH Agonists (e.g., Leuprolide):**
- Induce temporary menopause by reducing estrogen
- Shrink fibroids by 30-50%
- Used preoperatively to reduce size before surgery
- Limited to 6 months due to side effects (bone loss)
- Add-back therapy can extend duration

**Hormonal Birth Control:**
- Oral contraceptives, IUDs, patches
- Can help control bleeding but don't shrink fibroids
- Progesterone-releasing IUD (Mirena) especially helpful for bleeding

**Other Medications:**
- Tranexamic acid - reduces heavy bleeding
- NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen) - reduce pain and bleeding
- Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs)

**Minimally Invasive Procedures:**

**Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE):**
- Small particles injected into uterine arteries
- Cuts off blood supply to fibroids, causing them to shrink
- 70-90% symptom improvement
- Not recommended for women desiring future pregnancy

**MRI-guided Focused Ultrasound (FUS):**
- High-energy ultrasound waves destroy fibroid tissue
- Non-invasive, no incision
- Limited availability

**Radiofrequency Ablation:**
- Heat energy destroys fibroid tissue
- Can be done laparoscopically or transcervically

**Surgical Options:**

**Myomectomy:**
- Surgical removal of fibroids
- Uterus is preserved
- Best option for women desiring future pregnancy
- Approaches:
  - Hysteroscopic (through vagina/cervix) for submucosal fibroids
  - Laparoscopic (small incisions)
  - Abdominal (large incision) for very large or multiple fibroids
- Recurrence rate: 15-30% over time

**Hysterectomy:**
- Surgical removal of the uterus
- Only definitive cure for fibroids
- Eliminates possibility of future pregnancy
- Approaches: vaginal, laparoscopic, abdominal, robotic
- Ovaries may be preserved if desired

**Comparison of Treatment Options:**

| Treatment | Fibroid Removal | Fertility Preserved | Recovery Time | Recurrence Risk |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Watchful Waiting | No | Yes | None | N/A |
| Medications | No | Yes | None | High after stopping |
| UAE | No (shrink) | Possibly reduced | 1-2 weeks | Low |
| FUS | No (shrink) | Possibly | 1-2 days | Low |
| Myomectomy | Yes | Yes | 2-6 weeks | 15-30% |
| Hysterectomy | Uterus removed | No | 4-8 weeks | None |

**Choosing the Right Treatment:**

**For women wanting fertility:**
- Myomectomy is usually preferred
- Some medical management may help with symptoms while trying to conceive

**For women done having children:**
- More options available (UAE, hysterectomy)
- Decision based on symptom severity, recovery considerations, and personal preference

**For women near menopause:**
- Medical management to bridge to menopause
- Symptoms often improve naturally after menopause

**Newer and Emerging Treatments:**

- Elagolix (oral GnRH antagonist) - newer option with fewer side effects
- Relugolix combination therapy
- Ablation technologies continue to evolve

      title: 'Advanced Pathophysiology and Considerations',
      content: `This advanced section explores the molecular mechanisms of fibroid development and special clinical considerations.

**Molecular Pathogenesis:**

**Genetic Alterations:**

*MED12 Mutations:*
- Found in ~70% of fibroids
- X-linked gene encoding mediator complex subunit
- Somatic mutations (not inherited)
- More common in smaller fibroids

*HMGA2 Rearrangements:*
- Found in ~10-15% of fibroids
- Chromosomal rearrangements affecting high mobility group AT-hook 2
- Associated with larger fibroids

*Other Genetic Changes:*
- Chromosomal deletions (7q, 3q, 1p)
- Chromosomal additions (12q, 6p)
- Mutations in COL4A5/COL4A6

**Epigenetic Modifications:**

*DNA Methylation:*
- Global hypomethylation in fibroid tissue
- Promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes
- Altered expression of key regulatory genes

*Histone Modifications:*
- Aberrant histone acetylation/deacetylation
- Histone deacetylase overexpression
- Target for potential therapies

*Non-coding RNAs:*
- MicroRNA dysregulation (miR-21, miR-34a, miR-200 family)
- Altered lncRNA expression
- Potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets

**Growth Factor Signaling Pathways:**

*Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-β):*
- Overexpressed in fibroids
- Promotes extracellular matrix production
- Stimulates fibroid cell proliferation
- Key mediator of fibrotic process

*Insulin-like Growth Factors (IGF):*
- IGF-1 overexpression in fibroid cells
- Interacts with estrogen signaling
- May explain obesity-fibroid link

*Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF):*
- Mitogenic effects on smooth muscle cells
- Promotes angiogenesis

**Hormonal Signaling Mechanisms:**

*Estrogen Signaling:*
- Increased aromatase expression in fibroids
- Local estrogen production (in situ synthesis)
- Altered estrogen receptor alpha/beta ratio
- Estrogen promotes progesterone receptor expression

*Progesterone Signaling:*
- Complex role - both inhibitory and stimulatory effects reported
- PR isoform imbalance
- Progesterone stimulates Bcl-2 expression (anti-apoptotic)
- May be more important than estrogen for growth

**The Stem Cell Hypothesis:**

- Fibroids may originate from abnormal myometrial stem cells
- Side population (SP) cells identified in myometrium
- These stem cells have tumor-initiating capacity
- MED12 mutations occur early in stem cells
- Explains clonal nature of individual fibroids
- May explain variable behavior of different fibroids in same uterus

**Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Abnormalities:**

*Composition Changes:*
- Increased collagen type I and III
- Altered fibronectin distribution
- Increased proteoglycans (versican, decorin, biglycan)

*Degradation Imbalance:*
- Altered MMP (matrix metalloproteinase) activity
- Decreased MMP degradation
- Increased TIMP (tissue inhibitors) expression
- Result: excessive ECM accumulation

**Special Clinical Considerations:**

**Fibroids in Pregnancy:**

*Complications:*
- Miscarriage (2-3x increased risk)
- Placental abruption
- Placenta previa
- Fetal growth restriction
- Preterm labor and delivery
- Malpresentation (breech)
- Postpartum hemorrhage
- Cesarean delivery

*Red degeneration:*
- Occurs in 2-10% of pregnancies
- More common in 2nd trimester
- Caused by outgrowing blood supply
- Presents with acute pain, fever, nausea
- Usually managed conservatively

*Management considerations:*
- Most fibroids don't require intervention during pregnancy
- Myomectomy during pregnancy only in severe cases
- Delivery route based on obstetric indications

**Fibroids and Infertility:**

*Proposed mechanisms:*
- Distorted uterine cavity (submucosal fibroids)
- Impaired implantation
- Altered uterine blood flow
- Increased uterine contractility
- Inflammation

*Evidence:*
- Submucosal fibroids clearly reduce fertility
- Subserosal fibroids minimal impact
- Intramural fibroids - controversial, may have impact
- Myomectomy improves pregnancy rates for submucosal and large intramural fibroids

**Malignant Transformation:**

*Leiomyosarcoma:*
- Rare (<0.1% of fibroids)
- Not arising from benign fibroids (de novo)
- Cannot reliably predict which fibroids are malignant
- Rapid growth not a reliable indicator
- Age >50 is risk factor
- No reliable preoperative diagnosis
- Histologic diagnosis required (mitotic count, cellular atypia, necrosis)

**Novel Therapeutic Approaches:**

*Targeted Therapies:*
- Selective progesterone receptor modulators (SPRMs)
- Aromatase inhibitors
- GnRH antagonists (relugolix, elagolix)
- Vitamin D analogs

*Epigenetic Therapies:*
- HDAC inhibitors
- DNA methyltransferase inhibitors
- miRNA-based therapies

*Anti-fibrotic Therapies:*
- TGF-β inhibitors
- Pirfenidone
- Collagen synthesis inhibitors

          options: [
            'Large fibroids commonly transform into leiomyosarcoma',
            'Leiomyosarcoma arises de novo, not from benign fibroids',
            'Submucosal fibroids are most likely to become malignant',
            'All fibroids have equal potential for malignant transformation'
          ],
          correctAnswer: 1,
          explanation: 'Leiomyosarcoma arises de novo (as new tumors) and does not develop from benign fibroids. Malignant transformation of benign fibroids is extremely rare, if it occurs at all.',
