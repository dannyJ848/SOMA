      content: `PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age. It's one of the most common causes of infertility.

**What is PCOS?**
- Hormone imbalance
| Problems with ovulation
| Small cysts on ovaries (not actual cysts)
| Can cause irregular periods
| Can make it hard to get pregnant

**Common Symptoms:**
| Irregular periods or no periods
| Excess facial/body hair
| Acne
| Weight gain or difficulty losing weight
| Thinning hair on scalp
| Dark patches of skin (especially on neck)
| Skin tags

**What Causes PCOS?**
| Exact cause unknown
| Genetics (runs in families)
| Insulin resistance (body doesn't use insulin well)
| High levels of androgens (male hormones)

**How is PCOS Diagnosed?**
| Doctor will ask about your symptoms
| Physical exam
| Blood tests to check hormone levels
| Ultrasound to look at ovaries
| Usually diagnosed when 2 of 3 features are present

**Treatment Options:**
| Birth control pills to regulate periods
| Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise)
| Medication to help with insulin
| Fertility treatments if trying to get pregnant

**Complications if Not Treated:**
| Type 2 diabetes
| High blood pressure
| High cholesterol
| Sleep apnea
| Depression/anxiety
| Endometrial cancer

**Remember:** PCOS is very common and treatable. With proper management, most women with PCOS can have healthy lives and pregnancies.

      title: 'PCOS Pathophysiology and Management',
      content: `PCOS involves complex interactions between neuroendocrine dysfunction, metabolic abnormalities, and genetic predisposition.

**Pathophysiology:**

**Neuroendocrine Abnormalities:**
| GnRH pulse frequency increased
| LH secretion elevated relative to FSH
| LH pulse amplitude increased
| Ovarian theca cells produce excess androgens
| SHBG decreased by androgens

**Androgen Excess:**
| Ovarian theca cell hyperfunction
| Adrenal contribution (25% of androgens)
| Peripheral conversion of androgens to testosterone
| Some converted to estrone (weak estrogen)
| Androgens inhibit follicular development
| Cause hirsutism, acne, alopecia

**Insulin Resistance:**
| 50-70% have insulin resistance
| Compensatory hyperinsulinemia
| Insulin acts as co-gonadotropin, stimulating androgen production
| Increases androstenedione conversion to testosterone
| May directly stimulate ovarian theca cells

**Genetic Factors:**
| Hereditary component
| Twin studies: 70% concordance
| Multiple genes implicated (not one single gene)
| Epigenetic modifications possible

**Inflammation:**
| Chronic low-grade inflammation
| Elevated inflammatory markers:
  - C-reactive protein
  - Interleukin-6
  - TNF-alpha
| Contributes to metabolic dysfunction

**Management Strategies:**

**Lifestyle Modification (First-Line):**

**Weight Loss:|
| 5-10% weight loss can:
  - Restore ovulation
  - Improve insulin sensitivity
  - Reduce androgen levels
  - Improve lipid profile

**Diet:|
| Low glycemic index foods
| Moderate carbohydrate (40-45%)
| Adequate protein (20-25%)
| Healthy fats (30-35%)
| Anti-inflammatory foods

**Exercise:|
| 150 minutes/week moderate activity
| Both aerobic and resistance training
| Improves insulin sensitivity
| Reduces androgens

**Pharmacologic Management:**

**Combined Oral Contraceptives:**
| First-line for menstrual regulation
| Suppress ovarian androgen production
| Increase SHBG (binds androgens)
| Improve hirsutism and acne
| Contraindicated if pregnancy desired

**Metformin:**
| Improves insulin sensitivity
| Reduces androgen levels
| Can restore ovulation
| Dose: 500-2000 mg daily
| Contraindicated in pregnancy (category B)

**Anti-Androgens:|
| Spironolactone (50-200 mg daily)
| Cyproterone acetate
| Flutamide (rare due to hepatotoxicity)
| Must use contraception
| Contraindicated in pregnancy

**Ovulation Induction:**

**Clomiphene Citrate:**
| First-line for fertility
| Days 5-9 or 3-7
| Dose: 50-150 mg
| Monitoring with ultrasound
| Risk of multiples: 5-10%

**Letrozole:|
| Aromatase inhibitor
| May be superior to clomiphene
| Lower multiple pregnancy risk
| Better endometrial development

**Gonadotropins:|
| Injectable FSH/LH
| With or without IUI
| Requires intensive monitoring
| Higher multiple pregnancy risk

**Metabolic Management:**

| Intervention | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Metformin | Improves insulin sensitivity |
| Statins | Dyslipidemia |
| Weight loss | All metabolic parameters |
| Bariatric surgery | May resolve PCOS symptoms

      content: `PCOS involves complex neuroendocrine dysfunction with genetic, metabolic, and inflammatory components.

**Genetic Architecture:**

| Gene | Function | Association |
|------|---------|------------|
| FSHR | FSH receptor | Altered FSH sensitivity |
| LHCGR | LH/CG receptor | Altered LH response |
| DENND1A | GnRH pulse regulation | PCOS-like phenotype in animal models |
| THADA | Insulin signaling | Type 2 diabetes risk |
| LHCGR | Steroidogenesis | Androgen production |
| FBN3 | Follicle development | Ovarian development |

**Inheritance Pattern:**
| Familial clustering
| 70% concordance in monozygotic twins
| 30-40% heritability estimate
| Likely polygenic inheritance

**Pulsatile Hormone Secretion:**

**Normal:**
| GnRH pulses every 60-90 minutes
| Pulse frequency determines LH/FSH ratio
| Slower pulses favor FSH secretion
| Faster pulses favor LH secretion

**PCOS:**
| GnRH pulse frequency increased
| Faster pulse → more LH, less FSH
| Amplitude increased
| Disordered pulse pattern

**Androgen Production:**
| Ovarian theca cells stimulated
| Androstenedione produced
| Converted peripherally to testosterone
| Some converted to estrone (weak estrogen)
| Androgens inhibit follicular development
| Cause hirsutism, acne, alopecia

**Insulin as Gonadotropin:**
| Insulin amplifies LH effect on theca cells
| Increases CYP17 activity
| Enhances androgen production
| May directly stimulate ovarian theca cells

**Follicular Development:|
| Early antral follicle recruitment
| Arrest at small/medium size
| Multiple small follicles seen on ultrasound
| Dominant follicle selection fails
| No single follicle reaches maturity

**Epigenetic Factors:|
| DNA methylation differences
| Histone modifications
| May explain phenotypic variation
| Environmental influences

**Inflammatory Markers in PCOS:**

| Marker | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| CRP | Elevated 2-3x |
| IL-6 | Elevated |
| TNF-α | Elevated |
| Homocysteine | Often elevated |
| Vascular inflammation | Present

**Inflammation contributes to:|
| Insulin resistance
| Endothelial dysfunction
| Cardiovascular risk
| Possibly androgen production

**Intraovarian Environment:**

**Abnormal Folliculogenesis:|
| Arrested development
| Multiple small follicles
| Stromal hyperplasia
| Theca cell hyperplasia
| Increased vascularization

**Steroidogenesis:|
| Theca cells produce excess androgens
| Granulosa cells may produce estradiol but at suboptimal levels
| FSH resistance possible
| LH hyperresponsiveness

**Adipose Tissue Dysfunction:|
| Visceral adiposity common
| Adipokine dysregulation:
  - Leptin: elevated but resistance present
  - Adiponectin: decreased
  - Resistin: elevated
| Free fatty acids increased
| Contributes to insulin resistance

**Ovarian Pathology:**
| Subcortical stromal hyperplasia
| Increased ovarian stromal density
| Collagen deposition
| Hyperthecosis (clusters of luteinized theca cells)

**Management Implications:**

| Metformin Mechanisms:|
| Activates AMPK pathway
| Decreases hepatic glucose production
| Improves insulin sensitivity
| Decreases androgen production
| May directly affect ovarian function

**Weight Loss Impact:|
| Decreases visceral fat
| Reduces inflammation
| Improves insulin sensitivity
| Reduces free testosterone
| May restore ovulation

**Combined Oral Contraceptives:|
| Suppress ovarian androgen production
| Increase SHBG → lower free testosterone
| Improve hirsutism and acne
| Regularize periods
| Provide endometrial protection
