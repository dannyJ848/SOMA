      summary: 'Menopause is when your periods stop permanently, usually around age 51. The years leading up to it, called perimenopause, bring changes to your body as hormone levels shift.',
      explanation: `**What is Menopause?**
Menopause means your periods have stopped for good. You've officially reached menopause when you haven't had a period for 12 months in a row.

**Perimenopause (The Transition):**
This is the time before menopause when your body starts changing. It can last 4-8 years.

**Common Symptoms:**
- **Hot flashes:** Sudden feelings of heat, often with sweating
- **Night sweats:** Hot flashes that happen during sleep
- **Irregular periods:** May become heavier, lighter, more or less frequent
- **Sleep problems:** Trouble falling or staying asleep
- **Mood changes:** Irritability, anxiety, or feeling down
- **Vaginal dryness:** Can make sex uncomfortable

**What Helps:**
- Dress in layers for hot flashes
- Keep your bedroom cool
- Regular exercise
- Talk to your doctor about treatment options if symptoms are bothersome

**Important to Know:**
- Menopause is natural, not a disease
- You can still get pregnant during perimenopause until 12 months after your last period
- Many symptoms improve after menopause`,

      summary: 'The menopause transition involves declining ovarian function leading to irregular cycles, vasomotor symptoms, and urogenital changes, with final menstrual period occurring at average age 51.',
      explanation: `**Stages (STRAW+10 Staging):**

*Late Reproductive:*
- Subtle changes in cycle length
- Decreased fertility

*Early Perimenopause:*
- Cycle length varies by ≥7 days
- Symptoms may begin

*Late Perimenopause:*
- Skipped periods (≥60 days between cycles)
- Vasomotor symptoms peak

*Postmenopause:*
- 12 months after final menstrual period
- Early postmenopause: First 6 years
- Late postmenopause: Beyond 6 years

**Hormonal Changes:**
- Declining inhibin B and AMH
- Rising FSH (often first measurable change)
- Fluctuating estrogen (can be high or low)
- Eventually, consistently low estrogen

**Common Symptoms:**

*Vasomotor (75% of women):*
- Hot flashes: Sudden heat, flushing, sweating
- Night sweats
- Duration: Average 7 years, may persist >10 years

*Urogenital:*
- Vaginal dryness, irritation
- Dyspareunia (painful intercourse)
- Urinary frequency, urgency

*Other:*
- Sleep disturbance
- Mood changes
- Cognitive changes ("brain fog")
- Joint aches

**Health Considerations:**
- Cardiovascular risk increases
- Bone loss accelerates
- Weight distribution shifts`,

      summary: 'Menopause management includes hormone therapy for vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome, non-hormonal alternatives, and preventive care for cardiovascular and bone health.',
      explanation: `**Hormone Therapy (HT):**

*Indications:*
- Bothersome vasomotor symptoms
- Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)
- Premature ovarian insufficiency (<40 years)

*Types:*
- Estrogen-only: For women without uterus
- Combined (estrogen + progestogen): Required with uterus to protect endometrium
- Routes: Oral, transdermal, vaginal

*Timing Hypothesis:*
- Most beneficial if started <60 years old or within 10 years of menopause
- Favorable benefit-risk in this window
- Not recommended for initiation >10 years post-menopause for VMS

*Risks:*
- VTE (higher with oral vs. transdermal)
- Breast cancer (small increase with combined HT, appears after ~5 years)
- Stroke (rare increase)

**Non-Hormonal Options for VMS:**
- SSRIs/SNRIs: Paroxetine, venlafaxine, escitalopram
- Gabapentin
- Clonidine
- Cognitive behavioral therapy
- Fezolinetant (neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist)

**Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause:**
- First-line: Vaginal moisturizers, lubricants
- Vaginal estrogen: Low systemic absorption, safe for most
- DHEA vaginal insert (prasterone)
- Ospemifene (oral SERM)

**Preventive Care:**
- Bone density screening (DEXA) at 65, or earlier with risk factors
- Cardiovascular risk assessment
- Colorectal cancer screening
- Mammography per guidelines`,

      summary: 'Advanced menopause management requires individualized hormone therapy decisions considering cardiovascular risk, breast cancer history, bone health, and quality of life, with regular reassessment and familiarity with emerging therapies.',
      explanation: `**Individualized Hormone Therapy:**

*Cardiovascular Considerations:*
- Favorable lipid effects with oral estrogen (increases HDL)
- Transdermal estrogen neutral on lipids
- No primary prevention indication for CV disease
- Caution with existing CVD

*Progestogen Selection:*
- Micronized progesterone: May have less breast cancer risk
- Synthetic progestins: Various metabolic profiles
- Levonorgestrel IUD: Option for endometrial protection

*Duration of Use:*
- Reassess annually
- No arbitrary limit if benefits outweigh risks
- Extended use may be appropriate for premature menopause

**Special Populations:**

*Premature Ovarian Insufficiency (<40):*
- HT recommended until average menopause age
- Higher doses often needed
- Long-term bone and cardiovascular protection

*History of Breast Cancer:*
- Vaginal estrogen generally acceptable for GSM
- Systemic HT controversial; consider non-hormonal options
- BRCA carriers: Discuss with oncology

*History of VTE:*
- Transdermal estrogen may be considered with hematology consultation
- Consider non-hormonal alternatives

*Metabolic Syndrome/Obesity:*
- Transdermal preferred (avoids first-pass hepatic metabolism)
- Weight management counseling

**Long-term Health:**

*Bone Health:*
- Estrogen loss: 2-3% bone loss annually for first 5 years
- HT prevents bone loss
- Transition to bisphosphonate if HT discontinued
- DEXA monitoring

*Cognition:*
- HT does not prevent dementia
- May worsen cognition if started >65 years
- Early HT does not appear harmful to cognition

**Emerging Therapies:**
- Tissue-selective estrogen complex (TSEC)
- Neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists
- Estetrol (natural estrogen)
- Selective progesterone receptor modulators`,

      summary: 'Expert menopause care involves nuanced interpretation of evidence, management of complex cases including cancer survivors and women with multiple comorbidities, understanding of regulatory differences, and providing evidence-based counseling in a landscape of misinformation.',
      explanation: `**Evidence Interpretation:**

*WHI Study Context:*
- Mean age 63 at enrollment (past timing window)
- Conjugated equine estrogen + medroxyprogesterone acetate
- Does not represent all HT formulations or timing
- Overemphasis on risks led to undertreated symptoms

*Current Evidence Synthesis:*
- Early initiation: Net benefit for most symptomatic women
- Extended use decisions: Individualized risk-benefit
- Breast cancer risk: Small absolute increase, varies by formulation
- CVD: Neutral in timing window, potential harm in older women

**Complex Cases:**

*Breast Cancer Survivors:*
- GSM: Vaginal estrogen acceptable for most, especially ER-negative
- VMS: Non-hormonal options first-line
- Aromatase inhibitor-related symptoms: Challenging, multidisciplinary approach
- HABITS trial (halted early) vs. Stockholm study (neutral)

*Thrombophilia:*
- Transdermal estrogen does not increase VTE risk in same way as oral
- Factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation: Consider with hematology
- Careful patient selection, not absolute contraindication

*Cardiovascular Disease:*
- Existing CVD: Generally avoid HT
- Risk factors only: Individualize, consider transdermal

**Compounded Bioidentical Hormones:**
- FDA-approved bioidentical options exist (patches, micronized progesterone)
- Compounded products lack standardization, purity testing
- Salivary hormone testing not validated
- Counsel patients on evidence-based alternatives

**Global Perspectives:**
- Regulatory approval differs by country
- Duration recommendations vary
- Cultural factors affect treatment acceptance

**Quality of Life Framework:**
- Symptom severity assessment tools (MRS, MENQOL)
- Shared decision-making
- Balance of benefits, risks, and patient values
- Regular reassessment with continued symptom control

**Emerging Research:**
- Role of microbiome in menopause symptoms
- Genetic predictors of symptom severity
- Long-term outcomes with different HT formulations
- Non-hormonal targets for bone protection`,
