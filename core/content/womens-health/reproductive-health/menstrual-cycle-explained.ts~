      summary: "The menstrual cycle is a monthly process where your body prepares for pregnancy, and if pregnancy doesn't happen, you get your period.",
      explanation: `Think of your body like a garden preparing for a seed. Every month, your uterus (womb) gets ready to grow a baby by building up a soft, cushy lining. At the same time, an egg is released from your ovary.

If the egg doesn't meet with sperm to start a pregnancy, your body doesn't need that cushy lining anymore. So it leaves your body through your vagina as your period - that's the blood and tissue you see.

Then the whole process starts over again. Most cycles are about 28 days, but anywhere from 21-35 days is normal. Your period usually lasts 3-7 days.`,

      summary: 'The menstrual cycle is a hormonal process lasting about 28 days that involves the ovaries releasing an egg and the uterus preparing its lining for potential pregnancy.',
      explanation: `The menstrual cycle has four main phases:

**Menstruation (Days 1-5):** The uterine lining sheds as your period.

**Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):** Hormones cause an egg to mature in the ovary while the uterine lining rebuilds.

**Ovulation (Around Day 14):** The mature egg is released from the ovary.

**Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):** The empty follicle produces progesterone to maintain the uterine lining.

If the egg isn't fertilized, hormone levels drop and the cycle restarts with menstruation.

Key hormones include:
- **Estrogen:** Helps the egg mature and builds uterine lining
- **Progesterone:** Maintains the lining after ovulation`,

      summary: 'The menstrual cycle is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, involving coordinated release of GnRH, FSH, LH, estrogen, and progesterone to control follicular development, ovulation, and endometrial changes.',
      explanation: `The cycle begins with the hypothalamus releasing GnRH, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH.

**Follicular Phase:**
- FSH promotes development of ovarian follicles
- Follicles produce increasing estrogen
- Rising estrogen causes the endometrium to proliferate (proliferative phase)
- Estrogen exerts negative feedback on FSH

**Ovulation:**
- At mid-cycle, high estrogen triggers a positive feedback surge of LH (and FSH)
- Ovulation occurs approximately 36 hours after LH surge

**Luteal Phase:**
- The ruptured follicle becomes the corpus luteum
- Corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estrogen
- Progesterone transforms the endometrium into a secretory state suitable for implantation
- Without fertilization, the corpus luteum degenerates around day 26
- Hormone levels fall, triggering menstruation

The cycle averages 28 days but normal range is 21-35 days.`,

      summary: 'The menstrual cycle integrates pulsatile GnRH secretion, two-cell two-gonadotropin steroidogenesis, dominant follicle selection, and endometrial receptivity windows, with clinical implications for fertility, contraception, and menstrual disorders.',
      explanation: `**Neuroendocrine Regulation:**
GnRH is secreted in pulses; frequency and amplitude vary across the cycle to differentially regulate FSH and LH.

**Ovarian Steroidogenesis (Two-Cell Model):**
- Theca cells (LH-responsive) produce androgens
- Granulosa cells (FSH-responsive) convert androgens to estrogens

**Follicle Selection:**
- Multiple follicles begin development
- By day 7, one dominant follicle is selected via FSH threshold effects
- The dominant follicle produces increasing estradiol
- Estradiol >200 pg/mL for 50+ hours triggers positive feedback LH surge
- Ovulation occurs 10-12 hours after LH peak

**Corpus Luteum:**
- Has a fixed 14-day lifespan
- Unless rescued by hCG from implantation

**Endometrial Receptivity:**
- Implantation window occurs days 20-24

**Clinical Parameters:**
- Menstrual flow averages 30-40 mL
- >80 mL defines heavy menstrual bleeding
- Cycle irregularity may indicate anovulation, thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, or PCOS`,

      summary: 'Clinical management of menstrual cycle disorders requires understanding of neuroendocrine regulation, ovarian reserve assessment, endometrial dating discrepancies, and evidence-based approaches to anovulation, luteal phase defects, and cycle optimization for fertility or contraception.',
      explanation: `**Clinical Evaluation:**
- Menstrual history (cycle length, duration, flow)
- Hormonal assessment (day 3 FSH/estradiol for ovarian reserve, TSH, prolactin)
- Imaging (transvaginal ultrasound for antral follicle count)
- Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) provides cycle-independent ovarian reserve assessment

**Anovulatory Cycles:**
- Common at menarche and perimenopause
- In reproductive years, evaluate for:
  - PCOS (Rotterdam criteria)
  - Hypothalamic amenorrhea
  - Thyroid dysfunction
  - Hyperprolactinemia

**Luteal Phase Defect:**
- Short luteal phase, inadequate progesterone
- Remains controversial as a distinct entity

**Fertility Tracking Methods:**
- Cervical mucus changes
- Basal body temperature
- LH surge detection
- Follicular monitoring

**Cycle Regulation Options:**
- Combined hormonal contraceptives (suppress HPO axis)
- Progestins (endometrial stabilization)
- Ovulation induction (clomiphene, letrozole, gonadotropins)

**Emerging Tools:**
- Endometrial receptivity assays for implantation failure evaluation`,
