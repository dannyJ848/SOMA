# Acute Wounds: Cuts, Scrapes, Punctures, Burns, and Bites

## Overview

Acute wounds are injuries that happen suddenly and typically heal within a predictable timeframe. This guide covers the most common types and how to handle them.

---

## Cuts and Lacerations

### What They Are

**Cuts (Incisions)**
- Clean edges from sharp objects
- Knives, glass, razors, paper
- Usually bleed freely
- Generally heal well

**Lacerations**
- Jagged, irregular wound edges
- Caused by blunt trauma or tearing
- May have tissue damage around edges
- Higher infection risk than clean cuts

### Immediate Care

1. **Stop the bleeding**
   - Apply direct pressure with clean cloth
   - Elevate if on arm or leg
   - Maintain pressure for 10-15 minutes

2. **Clean the wound**
   - Rinse with clean running water for 5-10 minutes
   - Remove visible dirt or debris
   - Do NOT use hydrogen peroxide or alcohol (damages tissue)

3. **Assess the wound**
   - How deep? Can you see fat or muscle?
   - How long? Wider than 1/2 inch?
   - Does it gape open?
   - Is it over a joint?

4. **Cover appropriately**
   - Apply antibiotic ointment if desired
   - Cover with sterile bandage
   - Keep edges together if possible

### When Cuts Need Stitches

**Likely needs closure if:**
- Gaping open (edges don't stay together)
- Longer than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm)
- Deep (into fat or muscle)
- On face (for better cosmetic outcome)
- On hands (especially over joints)
- Bleeding won't stop with pressure
- Edges are very jagged

**Time matters**: Best results if closed within 6-8 hours (face: up to 24 hours)

### Home Care After Initial Treatment

- Keep wound clean and dry for first 24 hours
- Change dressing daily or when wet/dirty
- Watch for infection signs
- Expect some bruising around wound
- Stitches/staples usually removed in 5-14 days (depending on location)

## Abrasions (Scrapes)

### What They Are

- Surface injury where skin is scraped or rubbed off
- Common from falls, friction, sports
- Also called "road rash" or "rug burn"
- Usually superficial but can be quite painful
- May have dirt or debris embedded

### Why They Hurt So Much

Abrasions expose nerve endings in the skin's surface layer. Though not as deep as cuts, they often hurt more because of the large area of exposed nerves.

### Immediate Care

1. **Wash your hands** before touching the wound

2. **Clean thoroughly**
   - Rinse with clean running water
   - Use gentle soap around (not in) the wound
   - Remove all dirt, gravel, debris
   - Use a soft cloth or gauze if needed
   - This prevents "tattooing" (permanent dirt marks)

3. **Remove stubborn debris**
   - Use clean tweezers for larger pieces
   - Seek medical care if debris is deeply embedded
   - Don't leave anything in the wound

4. **Apply appropriate dressing**
   - Thin layer of antibiotic ointment (optional)
   - Non-stick dressing (like Telfa)
   - Secure with tape or bandage

### Healing What to Expect

| Day | What's Happening |
|-----|------------------|
| 1-2 | Oozing, stinging, redness |
| 3-4 | Scab forms, itching begins |
| 5-7 | New pink skin visible at edges |
| 7-14 | Scab falls off (don't pick!) |
| 2-4 weeks | Skin continues to mature |

### Tips for Optimal Healing

- **Don't pick scabs** - increases scarring
- **Keep slightly moist** - promotes faster healing
- **Protect from sun** - new skin burns easily
- **Expect color changes** - pink skin is normal, fades over months

## Puncture Wounds

### What They Are

- Deep, narrow wounds from pointed objects
- Nails, needles, thorns, teeth, splinters
- May look small but go deep
- High infection risk due to depth

### Why They're Concerning

| Concern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **Deep bacteria introduction** | Objects push germs deep into tissue |
| **Poor drainage** | Small opening seals over, trapping bacteria |
| **Difficult to clean** | Can't flush easily due to depth |
| **May damage structures** | Tendons, nerves, bones, joints |
| **Tetanus risk** | Especially with dirty objects |

### Immediate Care

1. **Let it bleed** (briefly)
   - Gentle bleeding helps flush bacteria
   - Don't squeeze excessively

2. **Clean the wound**
   - Wash with soap and water for 5 minutes
   - Let water run into wound if possible
   - Do NOT close the wound or push objects deeper

3. **Remove superficial objects only**
   - Pull out splinters visible at surface
   - Leave deeply embedded objects for medical care

4. **Do NOT seal tightly**
   - Cover loosely to allow drainage
   - Avoid tight bandages that trap bacteria

### When to Seek Medical Care

**Go immediately if:**
- Object deeply embedded
- Wound on foot (stepped on nail)
- Animal or human bite
- Can't remove all debris
- Signs of infection develop
- Numbness or can't move body part
- Bleeding won't stop

**Get evaluated soon for:**
- Any puncture from dirty or rusty object
- Puncture through shoes (pushes bacteria in)
- If tetanus shot not current

### Special Concern: Foot Punctures

Stepping on a nail or sharp object is especially risky:
- Bacteria from shoes and ground pushed deep
- Higher infection rates than other punctures
- Can involve bone (osteomyelitis)
- Pseudomonas bacteria common (from sneakers)

**All significant foot punctures should be medically evaluated.**

## Burns

### Classification by Depth

**First-Degree (Superficial)**
- Only outer skin layer (epidermis)
- Red, dry, painful
- No blisters
- Heals in 3-5 days
- Example: Mild sunburn

**Second-Degree (Partial Thickness)**
- Through epidermis into dermis
- Red, wet, very painful
- Blisters present
- Heals in 2-3 weeks
- May scar

**Third-Degree (Full Thickness)**
- Through all skin layers
- White, brown, or charred
- Leathery texture
- NOT painful (nerves destroyed)
- Requires medical treatment
- Always scars, may need skin grafts

### Immediate Burn Care

**DO:**
- Remove from heat source
- Cool with cool (not ice cold) running water for 10-20 minutes
- Remove jewelry or tight items (swelling occurs)
- Cover loosely with clean, dry bandage
- Take over-the-counter pain medication

**DON'T:**
- Use ice or ice water (causes more damage)
- Apply butter, oil, or grease (traps heat)
- Break blisters (protective)
- Use fluffy cotton (sticks to wound)
- Apply adhesive bandages directly to burn

### When Burns Need Medical Care

**Call 911 for:**
- Burns covering large body areas
- Burns on face, hands, feet, genitals, major joints
- Electrical or chemical burns
- Burns with difficulty breathing
- Third-degree burns of any size

**Seek medical care for:**
- Second-degree burns larger than 3 inches
- Burns that circle around arm/leg/finger
- Burns in young children or elderly
- Burns from chemicals, electricity, or radiation
- Any burn you're unsure about

### Home Care for Minor Burns

| Day | Care |
|-----|------|
| Days 1-2 | Keep clean, apply aloe or burn cream, cover loosely |
| Days 3-7 | Continue clean, moist environment; don't pop blisters |
| Week 2+ | Watch for healing, protect from sun |

## Bites: Animal and Human

### Why Bites Are Serious

Mouths contain many bacteria. Bites combine:
- Puncture injury (pushes bacteria deep)
- Crushing injury (damages tissue)
- Contamination (heavy bacterial load)
- Possibly venom or disease transmission

### Animal Bites

**Dog Bites**
- Most common animal bite
- Often crushing + puncture
- Infection rate: 5-15%
- Pasteurella bacteria common

**Cat Bites**
- Deep puncture wounds from teeth
- Very high infection rate (30-50%)
- Pasteurella almost always present
- Often need antibiotics

**Wild Animal Bites**
- Rabies risk assessment needed
- Especially bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes
- Capture animal if safely possible
- Report to health department

### Human Bites

Often more serious than animal bites:
- Highest infection rate (10-50%)
- Contains mixed bacteria
- Often on hands (punching)
- "Fight bite" - clenched fist hitting teeth

### Immediate Bite Care

1. **Control bleeding** with direct pressure

2. **Clean thoroughly**
   - Wash with soap and water for 5-10 minutes
   - Irrigate with clean water
   - Don't scrub aggressively

3. **Do NOT close the wound**
   - Most bites left open to drain
   - High infection risk if closed

4. **Seek medical care** for most bites

### When to Seek Care for Bites

**Always seek care for:**
- All cat bites (very high infection rate)
- All human bites
- Bites on hands, feet, face, genitals
- Bites over joints
- Deep puncture wounds
- Bites from wild animals
- If you can't clean the wound well
- If tetanus/rabies concerns

**Watch closely (can manage at home if):**
- Very superficial scratch
- From known, vaccinated pet
- Easy to clean thoroughly
- Not on high-risk area

### Signs of Bite Infection

Develop within 24-48 hours:
- Increasing pain
- Spreading redness
- Swelling
- Warmth
- Pus or drainage
- Fever
- Red streaks from wound

**Infected bites need antibiotics - seek care promptly.**

## Tetanus Considerations for All Acute Wounds

### What is Tetanus?

- Caused by Clostridium tetani bacteria
- Found in soil, dust, manure
- Enters through wounds
- Produces toxin affecting muscles
- "Lockjaw" - can be fatal

### Tetanus-Prone Wounds

- Puncture wounds
- Wounds contaminated with dirt, soil, manure
- Wounds from rusty objects
- Crushing injuries
- Burns
- Frostbite
- Bites

### Vaccine Recommendations

| Wound Type | Last Vaccine <5 years | Last Vaccine 5-10 years | Last Vaccine >10 years |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Clean, minor | No vaccine needed | No vaccine needed | Tdap or Td |
| Dirty/tetanus-prone | No vaccine needed | Tdap or Td | Tdap or Td + possibly TIG |

*TIG = Tetanus Immune Globulin (for high-risk wounds if not adequately vaccinated)*

### If You're Unsure

When in doubt about your vaccination status and you have a concerning wound, get a tetanus booster. It's safe and prevents a serious disease.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Clean all wounds well** - most important step
2. **Know when stitches are needed** - timing matters
3. **Puncture wounds need watching** - infection risk is high
4. **Cool burns with cool water** - not ice, not butter
5. **Take bites seriously** - most need medical care
6. **Stay up to date on tetanus** - especially for dirty wounds

---

## Complexity Levels

**Level 1**: Clean wounds with water and soap. Cover with bandage. See doctor for deep cuts, bites, or signs of infection (redness, pus, fever).

**Level 2**: Different wounds need different care. Cuts may need stitches if deep or gaping. Cool burns with cool water. Puncture wounds and bites have high infection risk and usually need medical care.

**Level 3**: Lacerations have irregular edges with higher infection risk than clean incisions. Cat bites have 30-50% infection rate due to deep inoculation with Pasteurella. Foot punctures risk osteomyelitis. Tetanus prophylaxis depends on wound type and vaccination history.

**Level 4**: Wound contamination is classified by bacteria count and type. Animal bites introduce polymicrobial flora including Pasteurella, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and anaerobes. Human bites add Eikenella corrodens. Prophylactic antibiotics (often amoxicillin-clavulanate) are indicated for high-risk bites.

**Level 5**: Bite wound management requires assessment of tissue devitalization, neurovascular status, and joint capsule involvement. Pasteurella multocida causes rapidly progressive cellulitis within 24 hours. Eikenella corrodens in human bites may cause septic arthritis or osteomyelitis with clenched-fist injuries. Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis algorithm depends on species, geographic location, and capture status.
