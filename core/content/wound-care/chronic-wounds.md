# Chronic Wounds: Understanding Long-Term Wound Care

## Overview

Chronic wounds are wounds that don't heal in the expected timeframe, usually defined as wounds not significantly improving within 4-6 weeks despite appropriate care. They require specialized treatment and often indicate underlying health conditions.

## Understanding Chronic Wounds

### Why Some Wounds Don't Heal

Normal wound healing requires:
- Adequate blood flow (oxygen and nutrients)
- Healthy immune response
- Proper nutrition
- Absence of infection
- Appropriate wound environment

Chronic wounds develop when one or more of these is impaired.

### Common Types of Chronic Wounds

| Type | Primary Cause | Typical Location |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| Pressure ulcers | Prolonged pressure | Bony prominences |
| Diabetic foot ulcers | Diabetes complications | Feet |
| Venous leg ulcers | Poor vein function | Lower legs |
| Arterial ulcers | Poor artery blood flow | Feet, toes |

## Pressure Ulcers (Bedsores)

### What They Are

Pressure ulcers develop when sustained pressure cuts off blood flow to the skin and underlying tissue. They commonly affect people who:
- Are bedridden
- Use wheelchairs
- Cannot change position easily
- Have reduced sensation

### Common Locations

**Lying on back:**
- Sacrum (base of spine)
- Heels
- Back of head
- Shoulder blades

**Lying on side:**
- Hips
- Ankles
- Ears

**Sitting:**
- Buttocks (ischial tuberosities)
- Sacrum/tailbone

### Stages of Pressure Ulcers

**Stage 1: Non-blanchable redness**
- Skin intact but red
- Redness doesn't fade when pressed
- May feel warm, firm, or painful
- **Key sign**: Skin is intact but at risk

**Stage 2: Partial thickness skin loss**
- Shallow open ulcer
- Pink wound bed
- May look like blister
- Epidermis and part of dermis damaged

**Stage 3: Full thickness skin loss**
- Fat may be visible
- Skin completely gone
- May have undermining (tunneling under edges)
- Bone, tendon, muscle NOT visible

**Stage 4: Full thickness tissue loss**
- Bone, tendon, or muscle exposed
- Often has undermining
- High infection risk
- May require surgery

**Unstageable**
- Wound covered with dead tissue (eschar)
- Cannot assess depth until cleaned

### Prevention Is Key

**Reposition frequently:**
- Every 2 hours if bedridden
- Every 15-30 minutes if in wheelchair
- Use pillows to offload pressure
- Keep heels elevated off bed

**Support surfaces:**
- Special mattresses (foam, air, water)
- Wheelchair cushions
- Heel protectors

**Skin care:**
- Keep skin clean and dry
- Moisturize dry skin
- Protect from friction
- Manage incontinence promptly

**Nutrition:**
- Adequate protein
- Sufficient calories
- Vitamin C and zinc
- Hydration

### Treatment Approaches

| Stage | Treatment Focus |
|-------|-----------------|
| Stage 1 | Relieve pressure, protect skin, increase repositioning |
| Stage 2 | Moist wound healing, appropriate dressings, address cause |
| Stage 3 | Debridement if needed, advanced dressings, nutritional support |
| Stage 4 | Surgical consultation, specialized wound care, treat infection |

## Diabetic Foot Ulcers

### Why Diabetes Causes Foot Ulcers

Diabetes affects feet through three mechanisms:

**1. Neuropathy (Nerve Damage)**
- Loss of protective sensation
- Can't feel injuries, pressure, or friction
- Don't notice problems until advanced

**2. Poor Circulation**
- Reduced blood flow to feet
- Slow healing
- Less ability to fight infection

**3. Immune Dysfunction**
- Higher infection risk
- Harder to clear infections
- Biofilm formation common

### Common Locations

- Ball of foot (under metatarsal heads)
- Under big toe
- Tips of toes
- Between toes
- Heel
- Over bony deformities (bunions, hammertoes)

### Warning Signs

**Check feet daily for:**
- Redness or color changes
- Swelling
- Warmth
- Cuts, blisters, or sores
- Calluses (pressure areas)
- Drainage or odor
- Changes in foot shape

### Prevention for Diabetic Feet

**Daily foot care:**
- Inspect feet every day (use mirror for bottoms)
- Wash feet daily, dry thoroughly (especially between toes)
- Moisturize tops and bottoms (not between toes)
- Trim nails carefully, straight across
- Never go barefoot
- Check inside shoes before wearing

**Footwear:**
- Well-fitting, protective shoes
- No tight or pointed shoes
- Break in new shoes gradually
- Consider diabetic shoes/inserts if prescribed

**Blood sugar control:**
- Better control = better healing
- Follow your diabetes management plan
- Take medications as prescribed

**Regular professional care:**
- Podiatrist visits as recommended
- Annual comprehensive foot exam
- Prompt attention to any problems

### Treatment Approaches

**Offloading (Critical)**
- Total contact cast
- Removable cast walker
- Special footwear
- Crutches or wheelchair if needed

**Wound care:**
- Regular debridement (removing dead tissue)
- Appropriate dressings
- Infection treatment when present
- Maintaining moist wound environment

**Address underlying issues:**
- Blood sugar optimization
- Blood flow assessment
- Nutrition support
- Smoking cessation

### When to Seek Immediate Care

- New ulcer or wound on foot
- Increasing redness, swelling, or warmth
- Fever or chills
- Foul smell or drainage
- Blackened tissue
- Unable to bear weight

> **Important**: Diabetic foot infections can become serious quickly. Don't wait to seek care.

## Venous Leg Ulcers

### What They Are

Venous ulcers result from poor blood return through leg veins. When veins don't function properly, blood pools in the lower legs, causing tissue damage and ultimately ulceration.

### How Venous Disease Develops

1. Vein valves become damaged
2. Blood flows backward (reflux)
3. Pressure builds in leg veins
4. Fluid leaks into tissues
5. Inflammation and skin changes occur
6. Ulcers develop

### Signs and Symptoms

**Before ulcers develop:**
- Leg swelling (worse at end of day)
- Aching, heaviness in legs
- Varicose veins
- Skin changes: brown discoloration
- Hardening of skin (lipodermatosclerosis)
- Eczema-like changes

**Typical ulcer characteristics:**
- Location: Lower leg, especially near ankle (medial)
- Shape: Irregular borders
- Wound bed: Red, moist
- Moderate to heavy drainage
- Usually NOT very painful
- Surrounding skin changes (brown, hardened)

### The Cornerstone of Treatment: Compression

**Why compression works:**
- Counteracts venous pressure
- Reduces swelling
- Improves blood flow
- Promotes healing

**Types of compression:**
- Multilayer bandages (applied by healthcare providers)
- Compression stockings (prescription strength: 30-40 mmHg)
- Velcro wrap systems
- Compression pumps

**Using compression safely:**
- Must rule out arterial disease first
- Start with lower compression if needed
- Graduated compression (tightest at ankle)
- Wear during the day, remove at night
- Replace stockings every 3-6 months

### Additional Treatment

**Leg elevation:**
- Above heart level when possible
- During rest and sleep
- Helps reduce swelling

**Exercise:**
- Calf muscle pumping
- Walking
- Ankle exercises

**Wound care:**
- Appropriate dressings for drainage level
- Treat any infection
- Protect surrounding skin

**Treat underlying issues:**
- Weight management
- Address edema causes
- Consider vein procedures if indicated

### Prevention of Recurrence

After healing, continued compression is essential:
- Wear compression stockings daily
- Elevate legs regularly
- Stay active
- Maintain healthy weight
- Monitor for new problems

> **Key point**: Venous ulcers often recur without ongoing compression therapy.

## Arterial Ulcers

### What They Are

Arterial ulcers result from inadequate blood supply to tissues. Without sufficient oxygen and nutrients, tissue dies and ulcers form.

### Causes

**Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD):**
- Atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries)
- Risk factors: smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol

**Other causes:**
- Blood clots
- Vasculitis
- Severe diabetes

### Signs and Symptoms

**Signs of poor arterial flow:**
- Cold feet
- Pale or bluish skin
- Thin, shiny skin
- Hair loss on legs and feet
- Weak or absent pulses
- Slow-healing wounds
- Pain with walking (claudication)
- Pain at rest (severe disease)

**Arterial ulcer characteristics:**
- Location: Toes, feet, areas of trauma
- Appearance: "Punched out" with well-defined borders
- Wound bed: Pale, may be gray or black (dead tissue)
- Little drainage
- VERY PAINFUL
- Surrounding skin: Pale, cool, hairless

### Critical Difference: Arterial vs. Venous

| Feature | Arterial | Venous |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Location | Toes, feet | Lower leg, ankle |
| Pain | Severe | Mild to moderate |
| Appearance | Punched out | Irregular |
| Wound bed | Pale/gray | Red, wet |
| Drainage | Minimal | Moderate to heavy |
| Skin around | Pale, shiny | Brown, hardened |
| Pulses | Weak/absent | Usually present |

### Treatment Approaches

**The critical issue is blood flow:**
- Vascular surgery consultation
- May need procedure to restore blood flow:
  - Angioplasty/stenting
  - Bypass surgery
- Sometimes amputation if not revascularizable

**Wound care:**
- Keep wound clean
- Appropriate dressings (different from venous)
- Pain management
- Avoid pressure on wound
- Do NOT use compression (restricts blood flow further)

**Risk factor modification:**
- STOP SMOKING (critical)
- Control blood pressure
- Manage cholesterol
- Diabetes control
- Antiplatelet medications

### Warning Signs - Seek Care Immediately

- Sudden increase in pain
- Foot turning blue or black
- New coldness in foot
- Increasing tissue death
- Signs of infection

> **Important**: Arterial ulcers often indicate severe disease. Without blood flow restoration, healing is unlikely and amputation may become necessary.

## Living with Chronic Wounds

### Emotional Impact

Chronic wounds affect quality of life:
- Pain and discomfort
- Mobility limitations
- Social isolation
- Depression and anxiety
- Financial burden
- Body image concerns

**Coping strategies:**
- Connect with support groups
- Talk to healthcare team about emotional concerns
- Maintain social connections
- Focus on what you can control
- Celebrate small progress

### Nutrition for Wound Healing

| Nutrient | Why Important | Food Sources |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| Protein | Building new tissue | Meat, fish, eggs, beans, dairy |
| Vitamin C | Collagen formation | Citrus, berries, peppers, broccoli |
| Zinc | Cell division, immune function | Meat, shellfish, nuts, seeds |
| Vitamin A | Skin health, immune function | Eggs, dairy, orange vegetables |
| Iron | Oxygen delivery | Meat, beans, fortified cereals |

**General guidelines:**
- Eat adequate calories (healing requires energy)
- Stay hydrated
- Consider supplements if unable to eat well
- Ask about nutritional assessment

### Working with Your Healthcare Team

**Key team members may include:**
- Wound care specialist
- Primary care provider
- Vascular specialist
- Podiatrist
- Diabetes educator
- Nutritionist
- Home health nurses

**Questions to ask:**
- What type of wound do I have?
- What is causing it?
- How long will healing take?
- What can I do to help healing?
- What are warning signs to watch for?
- How often should I be seen?
- What dressings should I use?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Chronic wounds have underlying causes** that must be addressed
2. **Pressure ulcers are preventable** with repositioning and pressure relief
3. **Diabetic foot ulcers require offloading** - taking pressure off the wound
4. **Venous ulcers need compression** - the most important treatment
5. **Arterial ulcers need blood flow** - compression is contraindicated
6. **Healing takes time** - weeks to months is normal
7. **Prevention of recurrence** is as important as initial treatment

## Complexity Levels

**Level 1**: Chronic wounds are wounds that don't heal in a normal time. They're usually caused by pressure, diabetes, or poor circulation. Keep following your doctor's instructions and watch for signs of infection.

**Level 2**: Different chronic wounds have different causes and treatments. Pressure ulcers need repositioning. Diabetic ulcers need pressure off the foot. Venous ulcers need compression bandages. Arterial ulcers need better blood flow (compression makes them worse).

**Level 3**: Chronic wounds result from local tissue hypoxia, elevated proteases, biofilm formation, and cellular senescence. Venous ulcers require 30-40 mmHg compression after ruling out arterial disease (ABI >0.8). Diabetic foot ulcers require offloading, debridement, and blood glucose optimization.

**Level 4**: Wound bed preparation using TIME framework: Tissue management (debridement), Infection/Inflammation control, Moisture balance, Edge advancement. Negative pressure wound therapy, growth factor applications, and cellular/tissue products may be indicated for recalcitrant wounds. Biofilm disruption requires physical debridement as topical antimicrobials have limited penetration.

**Level 5**: Advanced therapies include hyperbaric oxygen therapy (Wagner grade 3+ diabetic foot ulcers with adequate perfusion), bioengineered skin substitutes (Apligraf, Dermagraft), and autologous platelet-rich plasma. Molecular markers for healing prediction include inflammatory cytokine profiles, MMP levels, and angiogenesis markers. Emerging therapies include extracellular matrix scaffolds and stem cell therapies.
