## Stopping Bleeding

### Direct Pressure: The Most Important Technique

**Step-by-step:**

1. **Wash your hands** if possible (or use gloves)

2. **Apply firm, direct pressure**
   - Use a clean cloth, gauze, or bandage
   - If nothing available, use your bare hand
   - Press firmly directly on the wound

3. **Maintain constant pressure**
   - Don't peek or release (this disrupts clot formation)
   - Hold for at least 10-15 minutes by the clock
   - Use the flat of your fingers, not fingertips

4. **Add more material if bleeding through**
   - Don't remove the first layer
   - Add more cloth on top
   - Continue pressure

5. **Elevate if possible**
   - Raise injured limb above heart level
   - Reduces blood flow to the area
   - Works together with pressure

### When Pressure Isn't Working

**After 15-20 minutes of direct pressure:**
- If bleeding continues heavily, this is an emergency
- Call 911
- Continue pressure while waiting
- Consider tourniquet for limbs if trained

### Using a Tourniquet (Life-Threatening Bleeding Only)

**When to use:**
- Limb bleeding that won't stop with pressure
- Blood spurting
- Pool of blood spreading
- Life-threatening situation

**How to apply:**
1. Place tourniquet 2-3 inches above wound
2. Never place directly on joint
3. Tighten until bleeding stops
4. Note the time applied
5. Do NOT remove - let medical professionals handle
6. Keep it visible

> **Important**: Tourniquets are for emergencies when someone might bleed to death. Once applied, don't remove it.

### Types of Bleeding

| Type | Appearance | Urgency |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Arterial** | Bright red, spurting | EMERGENCY |
| **Venous** | Dark red, flowing steadily | Urgent |
| **Capillary** | Oozing | Usually self-limiting |

## Cleaning Wounds

### Why Cleaning Matters

- Removes dirt and debris
- Reduces bacteria count
- Prevents "tattooing" (permanent dirt marks)
- Significantly reduces infection risk

### How to Clean Wounds Properly

**Step 1: Prepare**
- Wash your hands thoroughly
- Gather supplies (clean water, gauze, mild soap)

**Step 2: Rinse with water**
- Use clean, drinkable tap water
- Run water over wound for 5-10 minutes
- Let water flow into wound
- Volume is more important than pressure

**Step 3: Remove debris**
- Use clean tweezers for visible particles
- Gently wipe with clean gauze
- Don't dig into the wound

**Step 4: Clean around the wound**
- Use mild soap AROUND (not in) the wound
- Clean outward from wound edges
- Rinse thoroughly

**Step 5: Pat dry**
- Use clean gauze or cloth
- Gentle patting, not rubbing
- Let wound air briefly before covering

### What to Use (and NOT Use)

| Recommended | Not Recommended |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Clean tap water | Hydrogen peroxide (kills healthy tissue) |
| Saline (salt water) | Rubbing alcohol (tissue damage) |
| Mild soap (around wound) | Iodine at full strength (tissue damage) |
| Wound irrigation syringe | Home "remedies" like urine |

### Wound Irrigation for Deeper Wounds

For punctures or deeper lacerations:
- Use a syringe (without needle) to flush wound
- Saline or clean water
- Moderate pressure to remove debris
- Flush until water runs clear

## When Stitches Are Needed

### Wounds That Usually Need Closure

**Based on appearance:**
- Wound edges gape open
- You can see fat (yellow), muscle (red), or bone
- Wound is longer than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm)
- Wound is deep

**Based on location:**
- Face (for cosmetic outcome)
- Over joints (movement causes gaping)
- Hands (function important)
- Feet (weight-bearing)

**Based on mechanism:**
- Clean cuts (not jagged)
- Wounds that won't stay closed on their own

### Wounds That Usually Don't Need Stitches

- Superficial scrapes (abrasions)
- Wounds with edges that stay together
- Very small punctures
- Wounds older than 24 hours (usually)
- Heavily contaminated wounds (may be left open)

### The Timing Factor

| Time Since Injury | Face | Body | Hands/Feet |
|-------------------|------|------|------------|
| Under 6-8 hours | Close | Close | Close |
| 8-12 hours | Maybe close | Usually leave open | Maybe close |
| 12-24 hours | Often still close | Leave open | Case by case |
| Over 24 hours | Case by case | Leave open | Leave open |

**Why timing matters:**
- Bacteria multiply in wounds over time
- Closing an infected wound traps bacteria
- Late wounds often need delayed closure

### Closure Options

| Method | Used For | Removal |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Sutures (stitches)** | Most wounds, best control | 5-14 days depending on location |
| **Staples** | Scalp, torso | 7-10 days |
| **Dermabond (skin glue)** | Small, superficial, low tension | Wears off in 5-10 days |
| **Steri-strips** | Very superficial, low tension | 7-10 days |

### If You Can't Get Stitches in Time

If a wound needed stitches but you couldn't get there:
- Clean thoroughly
- Bring edges together with butterfly bandages
- Expect a wider scar
- May heal fine, just slower
- Can be revised later if needed

## Tetanus Considerations

### About Tetanus

- Bacterial disease (Clostridium tetani)
- Found in soil, dust, manure
- Causes severe muscle spasms
- "Lockjaw" - can be fatal
- Preventable with vaccination

### High-Risk Wounds for Tetanus

- Puncture wounds (especially on feet)
- Wounds contaminated with dirt or soil
- Wounds from rusty metal
- Crushing injuries
- Burns
- Animal bites
- Wounds with dead tissue

### Do You Need a Tetanus Shot?

| Your Status | Clean Minor Wound | Dirty/Tetanus-Prone Wound |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Fully vaccinated, <5 years ago | No | No |
| Fully vaccinated, 5-10 years ago | No | Yes - Tdap or Td |
| Fully vaccinated, >10 years ago | Yes - Tdap or Td | Yes - Tdap or Td |
| Not fully vaccinated or unknown | Yes - Tdap or Td | Yes - Tdap or Td + possibly TIG |

*TIG = Tetanus Immune Globulin (provides immediate protection)*

### When to Get the Shot

- Ideally within 72 hours of injury
- Sooner is better
- Up to 21 days still has benefit
- Can be given at urgent care, ER, or doctor's office

### If You're Unsure of Your Status

**When in doubt, get the shot.** Tetanus boosters are safe, and tetanus disease is serious. It's better to have an "extra" booster than risk tetanus.

## Recognizing and Preventing Infection

### Normal Healing vs. Infection

| Normal | Concerning |
|--------|------------|
| Mild redness around wound (first 2-3 days) | Redness spreading outward |
| Slight swelling | Increasing swelling after day 3 |
| Mild warmth | Hot to touch |
| Some clear or slightly yellow drainage | Thick yellow, green, or gray pus |
| Mild tenderness | Increasing pain after day 2-3 |
| Gradual improvement | Getting worse |

### Warning Signs of Infection

**Local signs (at the wound):**
- Increasing pain instead of decreasing
- Spreading redness beyond wound edges
- Red streaks radiating from wound
- Swelling that increases
- Pus or cloudy drainage
- Foul smell
- Wound edges separating
- Delayed healing

**Systemic signs (whole body):**
- Fever over 100.4F (38C)
- Chills
- Feeling unwell
- Swollen lymph nodes near wound
- Fatigue

### When Infection Becomes an Emergency

**Seek immediate care for:**
- Red streaks traveling from wound toward heart
- Fever with confusion or rapid breathing
- Large area of redness spreading quickly
- Wound from animal/human bite becoming infected
- Infected wound in diabetic or immunocompromised person
- Signs of severe infection (sepsis)

### Preventing Wound Infection

**During initial care:**
- Clean wounds thoroughly
- Remove all foreign material
- Use clean bandages
- Consider antibiotic ointment (thin layer)

**During healing:**
- Keep wound covered until new skin forms
- Change dressings daily or when dirty/wet
- Wash hands before touching wound
- Don't touch wound unnecessarily
- Keep dressings dry

**For high-risk wounds:**
- Bites often need preventive antibiotics
- Very dirty wounds may need antibiotics
- Ask your doctor if antibiotics are recommended

## Step-by-Step: Putting It All Together

### Minor Cut or Scrape

1. Wash hands
2. Stop bleeding with gentle pressure
3. Clean with running water for 5 minutes
4. Remove debris with tweezers
5. Apply thin layer of antibiotic ointment (optional)
6. Cover with appropriate bandage
7. Change daily or when dirty/wet
8. Watch for infection signs

### Deeper Laceration

1. Wash hands
2. Apply firm direct pressure for 10-15 minutes
3. Once bleeding controlled, assess the wound
4. Clean gently if not going immediately for stitches
5. If wound gaps open, edges visible, or deep - seek care
6. If care delayed, butterfly edges together
7. Cover with clean dressing
8. Keep elevated
9. Get to medical care within 6-8 hours if possible

### Puncture Wound

1. Wash hands
2. Let wound bleed briefly (flushes bacteria)
3. Wash with soap and water for 5 minutes
4. Remove only superficial debris
5. Cover with loose bandage (don't seal tightly)
6. Seek medical evaluation (especially feet, bites)
7. Check tetanus status
8. Watch very carefully for infection

## Common First Aid Mistakes

### Don't:
- Use hydrogen peroxide or alcohol on wounds (damages tissue)
- Apply butter, oil, or toothpaste to burns
- Pull off stuck bandages (wet first)
- Close dirty wounds tightly
- Remove large embedded objects
- Apply tourniquet for minor bleeding
- Poke at wounds or pick scabs
- Cover with fluffy cotton (sticks to wound)
- Wait too long for stitches

### Do:
- Wash your hands first
- Use plenty of clean water
- Apply direct pressure for bleeding
- Seek care when unsure
- Keep tetanus updated
- Watch for infection
- Keep wounds appropriately moist
- Change dressings regularly

## Key Takeaways

1. **Direct pressure stops most bleeding** - 10-15 minutes, don't peek
2. **Clean with water** - not peroxide or alcohol
3. **Time matters for stitches** - seek care within 6-8 hours
4. **Check tetanus status** - especially for dirty/puncture wounds
5. **Know infection signs** - spreading redness, pus, fever
6. **When in doubt, get it checked out**

## Complexity Levels

**Level 1**: Stop bleeding with pressure. Clean wounds with water. Cover with bandage. See a doctor for deep cuts, bites, or if it looks infected.

**Level 2**: Apply direct pressure 10-15 minutes for bleeding. Clean wounds with running water (not peroxide). Wounds that gape open or show fat/muscle need stitches within 6-8 hours. Dirty wounds need tetanus check. Infection signs: spreading redness, pus, fever.

**Level 3**: Wound irrigation reduces bacterial load more effectively than scrubbing. Tetanus prophylaxis is based on wound classification (clean vs. contaminated) and vaccination history. Primary closure should occur within 6-8 hours for body wounds, up to 24 hours for face. Cat bites and human bites have highest infection rates.

**Level 4**: Irrigation pressure of 5-8 psi is optimal for bacterial reduction without tissue damage. Syringe with 19-gauge catheter achieves this. Delayed primary closure allows initial management of contaminated wounds. Tdap is preferred over Td for booster if never received Tdap. TIG provides passive immunity when vaccination history inadequate.

**Level 5**: Evidence supports tap water over sterile saline for wound irrigation with equivalent infection rates. Topical antibiotic use for clean wounds remains controversial with marginal benefit. Prophylactic antibiotics for dog bites only indicated for high-risk wounds; cat and human bites generally warrant prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies depends on species, attack type, and local epidemiology.
