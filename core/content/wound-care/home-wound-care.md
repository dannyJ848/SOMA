## Changing Dressings

### Step-by-Step Guide

**1. Prepare**
- Wash hands thoroughly
- Gather all supplies within reach
- Put on clean gloves if desired
- Ensure good lighting

**2. Remove Old Dressing**
- If stuck, wet with saline or water first
- Remove gently - don't pull forcefully
- Note what the old dressing looks like (color, smell of drainage)
- Dispose of old dressing in trash

**3. Assess the Wound**
- Look at size (is it getting smaller?)
- Color of wound bed (pink/red is good)
- Any drainage (clear, yellow, or concerning)
- Wound edges (coming together?)
- Surrounding skin (redness? Swelling?)

**4. Clean the Wound**
- Use saline or clean tap water
- Gently remove debris or old ointment
- Work from center outward
- Pat dry with clean gauze

**5. Apply Treatment**
- Thin layer of antibiotic ointment if using
- Or other prescribed treatment
- Don't over-apply

**6. Apply New Dressing**
- Non-stick pad directly on wound if needed
- Gauze for cushioning
- Secure with tape (don't wrap too tight)
- Ensure edges are sealed

**7. Clean Up**
- Remove gloves
- Wash hands again
- Dispose of materials properly
- Note date/time of change

## How Often to Change Dressings

### General Guidelines

| Situation | Frequency |
|-----------|-----------|
| Clean, dry wound | Every 1-2 days |
| Draining wound | Daily or more often |
| Post-surgery (initial) | As instructed (often 24-48 hours) |
| Infected wound on antibiotics | Daily or as directed |
| Special dressings | Per instructions (some stay 3-7 days) |

### Change Dressing If:

- It becomes wet or dirty
- Blood or drainage soaks through
- It starts to smell
- It falls off or loosens
- You need to check the wound

### Don't Change Too Often

Excessive dressing changes can:
- Disturb new tissue growth
- Introduce bacteria with each exposure
- Cause trauma to wound edges
- Delay healing

---

## Keeping Wounds Clean

### Daily Care

**What to do:**
- Change dressings as scheduled
- Keep the area dry between changes
- Avoid touching the wound unnecessarily
- Watch for signs of infection

**What to avoid:**
- Submerging wound in water (baths, swimming)
- Letting wound get contaminated
- Picking at scabs or wound edges
- Using harsh chemicals

### Cleansing Techniques

**Gentle irrigation:**
- Use saline or clean tap water
- Let water flow over wound
- Don't scrub or rub
- Pat dry gently

**When to use saline vs. water:**
- Both are acceptable for most wounds
- Saline is gentler on new tissue
- Tap water is convenient and effective
- Follow your healthcare provider's preference

### Products to Avoid on Wounds

| Don't Use | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Hydrogen peroxide | Kills healthy cells |
| Rubbing alcohol | Damages tissue, very painful |
| Full-strength iodine | Toxic to healing cells |
| Antibiotic ointment if allergic | Can cause reaction |
| Powders | Can cake and irritate |

## Keeping Wounds Appropriately Moist

### Why Moisture Matters

**Too dry:**
- Cells can't migrate
- Scabs form (barrier to healing)
- More painful
- Increased scarring

**Too wet:**
- Skin around wound breaks down
- Increased infection risk
- Dressing falls off
- Delays healing

### Achieving Balance

**For dry wounds:**
- Use moistening dressings (hydrogels)
- Apply thin layer of petrolatum
- Cover with appropriate dressing

**For wet wounds:**
- Use absorbent dressings
- Change more frequently
- Protect surrounding skin with barrier cream
- Consider advanced dressings

### Signs of Moisture Imbalance

**Too dry:**
- Wound looks dull or crusty
- Scab won't soften
- Wound bed is dark
- Dressing sticks

**Too wet:**
- Skin around wound is white/wrinkled (macerated)
- Dressing soaked through
- Surrounding skin breakdown
- Increased drainage

## Recognizing Normal Healing

### What to Expect: Timeline

**Days 1-3 (Inflammation)**
- Some redness around wound (normal)
- Swelling near wound
- Warmth
- Clear or slightly yellow drainage
- Tenderness

**Days 4-14 (Proliferation)**
- Pink or red tissue in wound bed
- Wound edges coming together
- Less drainage
- Itching (common - sign of healing!)
- Wound getting smaller

**Weeks 2-6 (Continued Healing)**
- New pink skin forming
- Scab falling off naturally
- Wound much smaller or closed
- Mild sensitivity

**Weeks to Months (Remodeling)**
- Scar matures and flattens
- Color changes (red to pink to pale)
- Texture softens
- Sensitivity decreases

### Signs of Good Healing

- Wound size decreasing
- Pink, healthy tissue
- Clean wound edges
- Decreasing drainage
- Less pain over time
- New skin at edges
- Scab lifting at edges (don't pick!)

### Normal vs. Concerning

| This is NORMAL | This is CONCERNING |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Mild redness at edges | Spreading redness |
| Clear/light yellow drainage | Thick pus (green, gray) |
| Mild swelling | Increasing swelling |
| Gradual improvement | Getting worse |
| Mild odor | Foul smell |
| Itching | Fever or chills |

## Special Situations at Home

### Managing Pain

**Medication options:**
- Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for mild pain
- Ibuprofen (Advil) for pain and inflammation
- Prescription pain medications if provided
- Topical numbing creams (lidocaine)

**Non-medication strategies:**
- Elevation (reduces swelling and pain)
- Cold packs (wrapped, not directly on wound)
- Distraction
- Relaxation techniques
- Positioning for comfort

**Timing pain medication for dressing changes:**
- Take pain medication 30-60 minutes before change
- Have everything ready to minimize time
- Work efficiently but gently

### Wounds That Bleed

If wound starts bleeding:
1. Apply direct pressure with clean cloth
2. Hold pressure for 10-15 minutes
3. Don't peek - keep continuous pressure
4. Elevate if possible
5. If bleeding soaks through, add more material
6. Seek care if bleeding won't stop

### Wounds That Won't Heal

If your wound isn't improving after 2-3 weeks:
- Contact your healthcare provider
- May need different treatment approach
- Could indicate underlying problem
- Don't wait indefinitely

## Key Takeaways

1. **Wash hands before and after** - most important step
2. **Change dressings appropriately** - not too often, not too little
3. **Keep wounds clean but not sterile** - tap water is fine
4. **Maintain moisture balance** - not too wet, not too dry
5. **Know normal healing** - so you recognize problems
6. **Watch for infection signs** - spreading redness, pus, fever
7. **Don't hesitate to call** - if something seems wrong
8. **Be patient** - healing takes time

---

## Complexity Levels

**Level 1**: Keep wounds clean. Change bandages when dirty or wet. Watch for infection: increasing redness, pus, or fever. Call your doctor if it looks worse instead of better.

**Level 2**: Change dressings every 1-2 days or when wet. Clean with water, pat dry, apply thin ointment layer, and cover. Some redness and drainage is normal at first. Worry if redness spreads, drainage becomes thick/colored, or wound gets worse after day 3-4.

**Level 3**: Optimal wound healing requires moist wound environment balanced with appropriate absorption of exudate. Occlusive dressings promote autolytic debridement and epithelial migration. Assess for signs of biofilm in non-healing wounds. Document wound dimensions and characteristics to track healing trajectory.

**Level 4**: Wound assessment includes tissue type (granulation, slough, neite), exudate characteristics, periwound skin condition, and wound edge advancement. TIME framework guides interventions. Dressing selection based on wound bed characteristics: hydrogels for dry wounds, alginates/foams for moderate-heavy exudate, silver or antimicrobial dressings for infected/critical colonization.

**Level 5**: Evidence-based wound care integrates assessment of bioburden, inflammatory markers, and tissue perfusion. Advanced modalities include negative pressure wound therapy, growth factor applications, and bioengineered tissue products. Patient-centered care addresses pain management, nutritional optimization, and psychosocial support within chronic wound management protocols.
