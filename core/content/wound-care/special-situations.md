## Wounds in People with Diabetes

### Why Diabetes Affects Wound Healing

Diabetes impairs healing through multiple mechanisms:

| Factor | Effect on Healing |
|--------|------------------|
| **High blood sugar** | Reduces immune function, feeds bacteria |
| **Neuropathy** | Can't feel injuries, delayed awareness |
| **Poor circulation** | Less oxygen and nutrients to wound |
| **Immune dysfunction** | Can't fight infection effectively |
| **Protein in urine** | Nutritional deficiency |
| **Medications** | Some may impair healing |

### Special Concerns

**Delayed recognition:**
- Neuropathy means you may not feel injuries
- Daily foot inspection is critical
- Check between toes, on soles
- Use mirrors or ask family for help

**Higher infection risk:**
- Bacteria grow well in high-glucose environment
- Infections spread quickly
- Can become limb-threatening rapidly
- Take all wounds seriously

**Slower healing:**
- Expect longer healing times
- Don't delay seeking care
- Wounds may worsen before improving

### Diabetic Wound Care Guidelines

**Prevention is key:**
- Inspect feet daily
- Wear proper footwear always
- Check inside shoes for objects
- Keep skin moisturized (not between toes)
- Trim nails carefully
- See podiatrist regularly

**For any wound:**
- Check blood sugar - high glucose delays healing
- Clean wound carefully
- Do NOT soak feet
- Protect wound with appropriate dressing
- Stay off the wound (offloading)
- Report any wound to healthcare provider

**Blood sugar management:**
- Keep blood sugar as controlled as possible
- Higher glucose = slower healing
- Check more often when you have a wound
- Adjust medications if needed (with provider guidance)

### Warning Signs for Diabetics

**Seek care immediately for:**
- Any new wound on foot
- Redness spreading from a wound
- Warmth around the wound
- Fever or chills
- Black or gray tissue
- Foul smell
- Drainage from wound
- Pain in a normally numb area

### Diabetic Foot Ulcer Basics

**Critical principles:**
1. **Offload** - Take pressure off the wound
2. **Debride** - Remove dead tissue (done by provider)
3. **Moisture balance** - Appropriate dressings
4. **Infection control** - Antibiotics if infected
5. **Blood sugar control** - Optimize glucose

**Common treatments:**
- Total contact cast
- Removable walking boot
- Specialized wound care
- Regular debridement
- Possible vascular intervention

## Wounds While Taking Blood Thinners

### Common Blood Thinners

| Medication | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| **Warfarin** | Coumadin, Jantoven |
| **Direct oral anticoagulants** | Eliquis (apixaban), Xarelto (rivaroxaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Savaysa (edoxaban) |
| **Aspirin** | Low-dose aspirin |
| **Platelet inhibitors** | Plavix (clopidogrel), Brilinta, Effient |
| **Heparin/LMWH** | Lovenox (enoxaparin) |

### Increased Bleeding Concerns

**What to expect:**
- Wounds bleed longer
- Bruising more easily
- Minor cuts may bleed significantly
- May need longer pressure

**Managing bleeding:**
- Apply direct pressure for longer (15-30 minutes)
- Don't peek - maintain continuous pressure
- May need pressure dressing
- Minor oozing may persist
- Elevation helps

### Special Considerations

**Before procedures:**
- Tell ALL providers you're on blood thinners
- May need to stop or bridge medications
- Surgeon and cardiologist/primary care should coordinate
- Never stop blood thinners without medical guidance

**For wounds:**
- Clean gently (don't scrub - causes bleeding)
- Apply pressure longer than normal
- Watch for signs of hematoma (blood collection)
- Report significant bleeding
- Be cautious with razors, sharp objects

### When to Seek Care

**Seek care for:**
- Bleeding that won't stop after 30 minutes of pressure
- Large or expanding bruises
- Blood in urine or stool
- Coughing blood
- Severe headache (could indicate bleeding)
- Any significant wound

**Medication questions:**
- Contact prescribing doctor about stopping medications
- Stopping without guidance can cause blood clots
- Starting/stopping requires medical supervision

### Wound Care Tips on Blood Thinners

| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Apply extra pressure time | Stop blood thinners without doctor's OK |
| Use pressure dressings | Use excessive force cleaning wounds |
| Watch for excessive bruising | Ignore unusual bleeding |
| Tell all providers about medications | Assume it's just a small cut |
| Keep INR appointments (if on warfarin) | Skip monitoring |

- Foul smell
- Delayed healing or wound getting worse
- Red streaks radiating from wound

**Systemic signs:**
- Fever (over 100.4F/38C)
- Chills
- Rapid heartbeat
- Feeling generally unwell
- Fatigue
- Swollen lymph nodes near wound

### Types of Wound Infection

**Superficial/Local infection:**
- Infection in skin and immediate tissue
- Usually treated with wound care +/- oral antibiotics
- May need drainage if abscess forms

**Spreading infection (Cellulitis):**
- Redness spreading beyond wound
- Warm, painful area expanding
- Needs antibiotics (often oral)
- Mark the edge of redness to track progression

**Serious infections:**
- Red streaks (lymphangitis) - urgent
- Deep tissue infection - urgent
- Necrotizing fasciitis - emergency
- Sepsis - emergency

### Treating Infected Wounds at Home

**If you've been prescribed antibiotics:**
- Take full course as prescribed
- Don't skip doses
- Take with food if causes stomach upset
- Finish even if feeling better

**Wound care for infection:**
- May need more frequent dressing changes
- Keep wound open enough to drain
- Clean gently with each change
- May use antimicrobial dressings
- Follow provider's specific instructions

**Tracking improvement:**
- Mark edge of redness with marker
- Check if redness is spreading or shrinking
- Note drainage amount and color
- Track fever
- Call if getting worse despite treatment

### When Infected Wounds Need Urgent Care

**Go to ER or call 911 for:**
- Red streaks heading toward body
- Fever over 101.3F (38.5C) with wound infection
- Confusion or altered mental status
- Rapid breathing or heart rate
- Skin turning blue, gray, or black
- Severe pain
- Feeling very ill

**These could indicate necrotizing fasciitis or sepsis - life-threatening conditions.**

### Antibiotic Considerations

**When antibiotics are needed:**
- Spreading infection (cellulitis)
- Signs of systemic infection (fever)
- High-risk patients (diabetics, immunocompromised)
- Certain bite wounds
- Deep infections

**When antibiotics may NOT be needed:**
- Localized infection that can drain
- Simple wound with good care
- No systemic symptoms

**Taking antibiotics properly:**
- Complete the full course
- Take at regular intervals
- Report side effects or worsening
- Don't share or save antibiotics

| **Hydrogel** | Dry wounds, debridement |
| **Hydrocolloid** | Light drainage, autolytic debridement |
| **Collagen** | Stalled wounds, tissue building |
| **Negative pressure** | Complex wounds, promoting granulation |

### Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT)

**What it is:**
- Also called "wound VAC"
- Sealed dressing with suction
- Removes fluid, promotes blood flow
- Changed every 2-3 days

**Used for:**
- Large open wounds

## Emergency Wound Situations

### Signs of Life-Threatening Infection

**Necrotizing fasciitis ("flesh-eating bacteria"):**
- Severe pain out of proportion to appearance
- Rapidly spreading redness
- Skin turning dusky or purple
- Blisters or bullae
- Crepitus (crackling feeling in tissue)
- Fever, fast heart rate, confusion
- **THIS IS AN EMERGENCY - call 911**

**Sepsis:**
- Infection spreading to bloodstream
- Fever or very low temperature
- Fast heart rate
- Fast breathing
- Confusion
- Feeling extremely ill
- **THIS IS AN EMERGENCY - call 911**

### Gas Gangrene

- Caused by Clostridium bacteria
- Severe pain
- Swelling with crackling texture
- Wound may have foul-smelling drainage
- Skin turns bronze to purple
- **THIS IS AN EMERGENCY - call 911**

### What to Do

1. **Call 911 immediately**
2. Keep person calm and still
3. Cover wound loosely
4. Note when symptoms started
5. List recent injuries or surgeries
6. Provide information to EMS

## Key Takeaways

1. **Diabetes requires extra vigilance** - daily foot checks, immediate attention to wounds
2. **Blood thinners mean longer pressure** - but don't stop medications without doctor's OK
3. **Know infection signs** - spreading redness, fever, and pus need treatment
4. **Watch for complications** - wound opening, fluid collections, unusual healing
5. **Immunocompromised patients** need lower threshold for seeking care
6. **Some situations are emergencies** - rapid spread, severe pain, systemic illness

---

## Complexity Levels

**Level 1**: Diabetes, blood thinners, and weak immune systems make wound healing harder. See a doctor for any wounds if you have these conditions. Go to ER for spreading infection, severe pain, or feeling very sick.

**Level 2**: Diabetics should check feet daily and keep blood sugar controlled for healing. On blood thinners, apply pressure longer and don't stop medications without doctor approval. Signs of serious infection: spreading redness, fever, red streaks. These need urgent care.

**Level 3**: Diabetic wound healing is impaired by neuropathy, microangiopathy, and immune dysfunction. Hyperglycemia impairs neutrophil function. Blood thinners require pressure hemostasis and coordination with prescribers for procedures. Cellulitis requires antibiotics; necrotizing fasciitis requires emergent surgical debridement.

**Level 4**: Diabetic foot infection classification guides management: mild (superficial, <2cm cellulitis) may use oral antibiotics; moderate-severe requires IV antibiotics and often surgical intervention. Direct oral anticoagulants have varying reversal agents. Wound culture results guide targeted antibiotic therapy. Biofilm disruption requires physical debridement; topical antimicrobials have limited penetration.

**Level 5**: Wagner and University of Texas classification systems guide diabetic foot ulcer management and predict outcomes. Necrotizing fasciitis has LRINEC scoring for risk stratification. Immunocompromised wound infections may involve atypical organisms (fungi, mycobacteria). Advanced wound biologics (growth factors, cellular matrices) may be indicated for recalcitrant wounds. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has evidence for Wagner grade 3+ diabetic foot ulcers with adequate perfusion.
