# Surgical Wound Care: Caring for Incisions After Surgery

## Overview

Surgical wounds are created in controlled, sterile conditions and typically heal well with proper care. Understanding how to care for your incision helps prevent complications and promotes optimal healing.

---

## General Principles of Surgical Wound Care

### The First 24-48 Hours

**What to expect:**
- Bandage left in place (usually)
- Some oozing or bloody drainage (normal)
- Swelling around incision
- Pain or tenderness
- Numbness near incision (nerves disrupted)

**What to do:**
- Follow your specific discharge instructions
- Rest as recommended
- Keep bandage clean and dry
- Take pain medication as prescribed
- Watch for excessive bleeding

### After the First Dressing Change

Most surgeons will:
- Change the dressing at first follow-up visit, OR
- Instruct you to change it at home after 24-48 hours

**Always follow YOUR surgeon's specific instructions** - they know your wound best.

## Incision Care Basics

### Keeping Your Incision Clean

**General principles:**
- Gentle cleansing only
- No scrubbing or rubbing
- Pat dry (don't rub)
- Keep dry between cleanings

**How to clean:**
1. Wash hands thoroughly
2. Use mild soap and water OR saline
3. Gently clean around incision
4. Rinse well
5. Pat dry with clean cloth or gauze
6. Apply new dressing if required

### What NOT to Do

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Submerging in water | Infection risk |
| Picking at scabs or crusts | Disrupts healing |
| Applying lotions/creams unless told | May irritate |
| Strenuous activity too soon | May open wound |
| Exposing to direct sunlight | Darkens scar |
| Smoking | Delays healing significantly |

### Dressing or No Dressing?

Your surgeon will advise. In general:

**Cover if:**
- Still draining
- At risk of rubbing on clothes
- In dirty environment
- Surgeon prefers covered

**May leave open if:**
- Dry and closed
- Well-healed
- Surgeon approves

## Staple Care

### What Are Surgical Staples?

- Metal fasteners that hold skin edges together
- Quick to place
- Strong hold
- Commonly used for scalp, torso, extremities
- Removed in office when healed

### Caring for Staples

**Daily care:**
- Keep area clean and dry
- Gently clean with soap and water after 24-48 hours
- Pat dry thoroughly
- May cover with bandage if rubbing on clothes
- Don't pick at or pull staples

**What's normal:**
- Slight redness around each staple
- Mild crusting at staple sites
- Numbness near incision
- Itching as healing progresses

**What's NOT normal:**
- Significant drainage
- Spreading redness
- Increasing pain
- Staples pulling through skin
- Fever

### Staple Removal

**Typical timing:**
| Location | Days Until Removal |
|----------|-------------------|
| Scalp | 7-10 days |
| Trunk (chest, abdomen, back) | 7-10 days |
| Arms, legs | 10-14 days |
| Over joints | 14+ days |

**The procedure:**
- Done in office or clinic
- Special staple remover used
- Minimal discomfort (pinching sensation)
- Steri-strips often applied after
- Takes just a few minutes

---

## Suture (Stitch) Care

### Types of Sutures

**Absorbable sutures:**
- Dissolve on their own
- Used internally or in certain areas
- Don't need removal
- May see small pieces come to surface

**Non-absorbable sutures:**
- Must be removed
- Common for skin closure
- Timing depends on location

### Caring for Sutured Wounds

**Keep clean:**
- Gentle soap and water after 24-48 hours
- Don't soak
- Pat dry
- May apply thin layer of antibiotic ointment if directed

**Protect the area:**
- Cover if at risk of trauma
- Avoid tension on sutures (no heavy lifting/stretching)
- Don't pick at sutures or knots

### Suture Removal Timing

| Location | Days Until Removal |
|----------|-------------------|
| Face | 5-7 days |
| Scalp | 7-10 days |
| Eyelids | 3-5 days |
| Chest/abdomen | 7-10 days |
| Back | 10-14 days |
| Arms | 7-10 days |
| Legs | 10-14 days |
| Over joints | 14+ days |
| Hands/feet | 10-14 days |

**Why timing matters:**
- Too early: wound may open
- Too late: increased scarring, "railroad track" marks

### What to Expect at Suture Removal

- Usually minimal pain (tugging sensation)
- Each suture cut and pulled through
- May apply steri-strips after
- Takes a few minutes
- Instructions for ongoing care given

---

## Steri-Strip Care

### What Are Steri-Strips?

- Thin adhesive strips
- Hold wound edges together
- Used alone or after suture/staple removal
- Provide continued support during healing

### Caring for Steri-Strips

**Do:**
- Keep them dry for first 24-48 hours
- After that, brief water exposure OK (shower)
- Pat dry gently - don't rub
- Let them fall off naturally
- Can trim ends if they peel up

**Don't:**
- Peel them off early
- Soak in tub or pool
- Scrub or rub them
- Put tape directly over them

### Steri-Strips Falling Off

**Normal timeline:**
- Start peeling at edges: 5-7 days
- Fall off on their own: 7-14 days
- Some last longer - that's OK

**If they fall off early:**
- If wound is well-healed: OK
- If wound gaps open: contact surgeon
- You may apply new ones if provided

---

## Drain Care

### What Are Surgical Drains?

Tubes placed during surgery to:
- Remove excess blood or fluid
- Prevent fluid collection (seroma/hematoma)
- Allow healing from inside out

**Common types:**
- Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain - bulb suction
- Hemovac - larger reservoir
- Penrose - passive drainage

### JP Drain Care (Most Common)

**Emptying the drain:**
1. Wash hands
2. Open the bulb stopper
3. Pour fluid into measuring cup
4. Squeeze bulb flat
5. Replace stopper while bulb compressed
6. Record amount and color

**How often:**
- Usually 2-3 times daily
- More often if fills quickly
- Record each time

**What to record:**
- Date and time
- Amount (in cc or ml)
- Color (bloody, pink, clear, cloudy)
- Any odor

### Caring for the Drain Site

- Keep area clean and dry
- Cleanse around tube with soap and water
- May apply thin gauze around site
- Secure tubing to body (prevents pulling)
- Don't tug on drain

### Drain Removal

**When:**
- Output decreases (usually <30ml/day)
- Surgeon determines timing
- Usually days to 1-2 weeks after surgery

**The procedure:**
- Done in office
- Quick removal (seconds)
- Brief discomfort (pulling sensation)
- Pressure applied afterward
- Small bandage placed

### Warning Signs with Drains

- Drain falls out
- Sudden stop in drainage
- Foul smell
- Fever
- Increasing redness at site
- Pain increasing
- Thick, colored discharge

## Showering with Surgical Wounds

### General Timeline

| Time After Surgery | Usually OK |
|-------------------|------------|
| 24-48 hours | Sponge bath, avoid incision |
| 48+ hours | Quick shower if approved |
| 1-2 weeks | Full shower (keep dry or brief exposure) |
| After sutures out | Usually normal showering |
| Baths/swimming | Usually 2-4 weeks+ |

**Always follow YOUR surgeon's specific instructions.**

### How to Shower Safely

**Before showering:**
- Check with surgeon if OK
- Have clean dressing ready
- Keep shower brief

**During shower:**
- Use lukewarm water
- Let water run over incision (don't aim stream directly at it)
- Don't scrub
- Use mild soap nearby, not on incision
- Keep shower short (5-10 minutes)

**After shower:**
- Pat incision dry gently
- Air dry briefly
- Apply new dressing if needed
- Check that incision looks OK

### Protecting Incisions from Water

**If you need to keep incision completely dry:**
- Use plastic wrap over dressing, taped at edges
- Special waterproof bandages
- Handheld shower head for control
- Keep showers very brief
- Pat dry immediately

### When NOT to Get Incision Wet

- Open wound or drainage
- Surgeon says not yet
- Active infection
- Exposed sutures/staples (sometimes)
- Drain in place (usually protect site)

## Signs of Healing vs. Complications

### Normal Healing Signs

| Timeframe | What's Normal |
|-----------|---------------|
| Days 1-3 | Redness at edges, swelling, mild drainage, pain |
| Days 4-7 | Swelling decreasing, edges sealing, crusting at sutures |
| Week 2 | Scab/crust falling off, itching, reduced pain |
| Weeks 3-6 | Scar forming, pink color, some numbness |
| Months | Scar fading, sensation returning |

### Warning Signs - Contact Your Surgeon

**Infection signs:**
- Increasing redness (especially spreading)
- Warmth and swelling worsening
- Thick, colored, or foul-smelling discharge
- Fever over 100.4F (38C)
- Red streaks from incision
- Increasing pain

**Other concerns:**
- Incision opening up
- Sutures or staples pulling through
- Significant bleeding
- Large swelling under incision
- Numbness spreading
- Unable to take prescribed medications

### When to Seek Immediate Care

- Incision fully opens with tissue visible
- Significant bleeding that won't stop
- High fever with wound changes
- Signs of serious infection (red streaks, confusion)
- Difficulty breathing (some surgeries)

---

## Activity Restrictions

### Why Restrictions Matter

- Prevents wound opening
- Reduces strain on healing tissue
- Prevents bleeding or hematoma
- Allows internal healing

### Common Restrictions

| Activity | Typical Restriction |
|----------|-------------------|
| Lifting | No heavy lifting (>10 lbs) for 4-6 weeks |
| Exercise | Avoid strenuous activity 2-6 weeks |
| Stretching | Avoid stretching incision area |
| Driving | After off narcotics, can turn safely |
| Swimming | Usually 2-4 weeks after closure |
| Sexual activity | Depends on surgery type |
| Return to work | Varies widely by surgery |

**Always follow YOUR surgeon's specific restrictions.**

## Scar Management

### Early Scar Care (First 2 Weeks)

- Keep incision clean and protected
- Avoid sun exposure
- No creams or lotions unless approved
- Don't pick scabs

### After Incision is Healed

**Sun protection:**
- Keep scar out of sun for 6-12 months
- Use sunscreen SPF 30+ if exposed
- Sun darkens scars

**Massage (if approved by surgeon):**
- Start 2-4 weeks after suture removal
- Gentle circular motions
- Use lotion or oil
- Helps break up scar tissue
- 5-10 minutes daily

**Silicone products:**
- Silicone sheets or gel
- May help flatten/soften scars
- Start after wound fully closed
- Use daily for months

### When Scars Need Extra Help

Contact your surgeon if:
- Scar becomes raised (keloid/hypertrophic)
- Scar is painful or itchy long-term
- Scar restricts movement
- Cosmetic concerns

**Treatment options:**
- Steroid injections
- Silicone sheeting
- Laser treatment
- Scar revision surgery

## Key Takeaways

1. **Follow YOUR surgeon's instructions** - they're specific to your surgery
2. **Keep incisions clean and dry** - especially the first 48 hours
3. **Don't pick or pull** at sutures, staples, or scabs
4. **Know warning signs** - call if redness spreads, fever develops, or wound opens
5. **Be patient with activity** - follow restrictions to prevent complications
6. **Protect your scar** - sun avoidance and gentle care
7. **Report concerns promptly** - better to check than to wait

---

## Complexity Levels

**Level 1**: Keep your incision clean and dry. Don't pick at it. Watch for signs of infection: increasing redness, pus, or fever. Follow your surgeon's instructions for dressing changes and activity.

**Level 2**: Shower briefly after 48 hours if approved. Clean around incision with mild soap and water, pat dry. Staples and sutures are removed in 5-14 days depending on location. Avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity until cleared. Report spreading redness, increasing pain, or drainage.

**Level 3**: Surgical wound healing requires adequate tissue perfusion, absence of infection, and controlled tension. Primary closure achieves healing by first intention with minimal granulation tissue. Drain output trends guide removal timing. Dehiscence risk factors include obesity, diabetes, poor nutrition, smoking, and early excessive activity.

**Level 4**: Surgical site infection (SSI) occurs in 2-5% of clean procedures. Risk stratification includes ASA score, wound classification, and procedure duration. Prophylactic antibiotics given within 60 minutes of incision reduce SSI rates. Negative pressure wound therapy may be applied to high-risk closures. Fascial dehiscence requires emergent surgical evaluation.

**Level 5**: Evidence-based enhanced recovery protocols (ERAS) optimize perioperative factors affecting wound healing. Closed-incision negative pressure therapy demonstrates reduced SSI in high-risk populations. Antimicrobial sutures show benefit in contaminated procedures. Long-term scar management includes pulsed dye laser for erythema, silicone sheeting for prevention of hypertrophic scarring, and intralesional corticosteroids for established hypertrophic scars or keloids.
