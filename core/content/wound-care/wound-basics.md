# Wound Basics: Understanding How Your Body Heals

## Overview

A wound is any break or damage to your skin or underlying tissues. Understanding how wounds occur and heal helps you take better care of injuries and know when to seek medical attention.

## Types of Wounds

### Open Wounds
Wounds where the skin is broken:

| Type | Description | Common Causes |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Incision** | Clean cut with smooth edges | Knives, glass, surgical scalpels |
| **Laceration** | Jagged, irregular tear | Blunt trauma, machinery, falls |
| **Abrasion** | Scraped skin surface | Falls, friction, road rash |
| **Puncture** | Deep hole from pointed object | Nails, needles, animal bites |
| **Avulsion** | Skin or tissue torn away | Severe trauma, accidents |

### Closed Wounds
Wounds where the skin remains intact:

- **Contusion (Bruise)**: Blood vessels damaged under skin
- **Hematoma**: Larger collection of blood under skin
- **Crush injury**: Tissue damaged by compression

### By Cause

**Traumatic Wounds**
- Cuts, scrapes, burns
- Animal or human bites
- Gunshot or stab wounds

**Surgical Wounds**
- Planned incisions
- Controlled environment
- Usually clean

**Chronic Wounds**
- Pressure ulcers
- Diabetic foot ulcers
- Venous ulcers
- Do not heal in expected timeframe

## The Four Phases of Wound Healing

Your body follows a remarkable, predictable sequence to repair wounds.

### Phase 1: Hemostasis (Immediate - Minutes)
**What happens**: Stopping the bleeding

- Blood vessels constrict to reduce blood flow
- Platelets clump together at wound site
- Clotting factors create a fibrin mesh
- A scab forms to protect the wound

**What you'll notice**:
- Bleeding slows and stops
- Blood thickens at wound site
- Scab begins forming

### Phase 2: Inflammation (Days 1-4)
**What happens**: Cleaning and defending

- Blood vessels dilate to bring healing cells
- White blood cells attack bacteria
- Dead cells and debris are removed
- Growth factors are released

**What you'll notice**:
- Redness around wound
- Warmth to the touch
- Swelling
- Some pain or tenderness
- Clear or slightly yellow fluid

> **Important**: These signs are NORMAL in the first few days. They become concerning only if they worsen after day 3-4 or are severe.

### Phase 3: Proliferation (Days 4-21)
**What happens**: Rebuilding tissue

- New blood vessels form (angiogenesis)
- Collagen is produced for strength
- Granulation tissue fills the wound (pink/red, bumpy)
- Wound edges pull together (contraction)
- New skin cells cover the surface (epithelialization)

**What you'll notice**:
- Wound gets smaller
- Pink or red tissue in wound bed
- New skin growing from edges
- Less drainage
- Itching (sign of healing)

### Phase 4: Remodeling (3 Weeks - 2 Years)
**What happens**: Strengthening and maturing

- Collagen reorganizes for strength
- Scar tissue matures
- Blood vessel density decreases
- Skin regains some function

**What you'll notice**:
- Scar changes from red/pink to paler
- Scar becomes flatter
- Scar softens over time
- Some permanent changes may remain

## Factors That Affect Wound Healing

### Factors That HELP Healing

| Factor | Why It Helps |
|--------|--------------|
| Good nutrition | Provides building blocks for new tissue |
| Adequate protein | Essential for collagen production |
| Vitamin C | Critical for collagen synthesis |
| Zinc | Supports cell division and immune function |
| Hydration | Maintains tissue health |
| Good blood flow | Delivers oxygen and nutrients |
| Clean wound | Prevents infection |
| Moist wound environment | Promotes cell migration |
| Rest | Allows energy for healing |
| Not smoking | Maintains oxygen delivery |

### Factors That SLOW Healing

**Medical Conditions**
- Diabetes (impairs blood flow, immune function)
- Peripheral vascular disease (reduced circulation)
- Immune disorders (weakened defense)
- Kidney disease (affects nutrition, fluid balance)
- Obesity (reduced blood flow to fat tissue)

**Medications**
- Steroids (suppress inflammation needed for healing)
- Chemotherapy (reduces cell division)
- Blood thinners (may cause bleeding)
- NSAIDs (may slow early inflammation phase)

**Lifestyle Factors**
- Smoking (reduces oxygen delivery by 25-50%)
- Poor nutrition (lacks building blocks)
- Alcohol excess (impairs immune function)
- Stress (raises cortisol, slows healing)
- Lack of sleep (reduces growth hormone)

**Local Factors**
- Infection (diverts resources to fighting bacteria)
- Poor blood supply (starves wound of nutrients)
- Repeated trauma (interrupts healing)
- Foreign bodies (cause ongoing inflammation)
- Excessive moisture (macerates skin)
- Excessive dryness (slows cell migration)

**Age**
- Older adults heal more slowly
- Skin is thinner and more fragile
- Reduced collagen production
- Decreased immune response

## Wound Healing by Intention

### Primary Intention
- Wound edges are brought together (stitches, staples)
- Minimal scarring
- Fastest healing
- Example: Surgical incisions

### Secondary Intention
- Wound left open to heal from bottom up
- More granulation tissue needed
- Larger scar
- Takes longer
- Example: Pressure ulcers, some infected wounds

### Tertiary Intention (Delayed Primary)
- Wound left open initially (to drain or treat infection)
- Closed later with stitches
- Example: Contaminated wounds cleaned before closure

## Understanding Your Wound

### Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **How did this wound happen?**
   - Clean or dirty object?
   - Possibility of foreign material?

2. **How deep is it?**
   - Surface only (abrasion)
   - Through the skin
   - Into fat, muscle, or bone

3. **How big is it?**
   - Length and width
   - Compare to common objects (coin, fingernail)

4. **Where is it located?**
   - Over joints (more tension)
   - On hands, face (may need specialized care)
   - On legs or feet (slower healing)

5. **What are my risk factors?**
   - Diabetes
   - Poor circulation
   - Medications
   - Smoking

## When Wounds Need Medical Attention

### Seek Care Immediately For:
- Bleeding that won't stop after 10-15 minutes of pressure
- Deep wounds or wounds that gape open
- Wounds on face, hands, genitals
- Wounds from animal or human bites
- Wounds with embedded objects
- Wounds with numbness beyond the injury
- Signs of severe infection (fever, spreading redness, red streaks)

### Seek Care Soon (Within 24-48 Hours) For:
- Wounds that may need stitches
- Puncture wounds (especially on feet)
- Wounds from rusty or dirty objects
- Wounds not healing as expected
- Any concerns about proper healing

## Key Takeaways

1. **Wounds heal in predictable phases** - understanding them helps you know what's normal
2. **Some inflammation is normal** - redness, warmth, and swelling in the first few days
3. **Many factors affect healing** - optimize what you can control
4. **Most wounds heal well** - with proper care
5. **Know when to seek help** - some wounds need professional care

## Complexity Levels

**Level 1**: Wounds are breaks in the skin. Keep them clean, watch for signs of infection (increasing redness, pus, fever). Most heal on their own with basic care.

**Level 2**: Wounds heal in phases: stopping bleeding, inflammation (normal redness/swelling), rebuilding tissue, and remodeling. Good nutrition and not smoking help healing.

**Level 3**: The four healing phases are hemostasis, inflammation (days 1-4), proliferation (days 4-21), and remodeling (weeks to years). Factors like diabetes, poor circulation, medications, and smoking can significantly slow healing.

**Level 4**: Wound healing involves complex cellular processes including platelet aggregation, neutrophil and macrophage activity, fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and collagen synthesis. Multiple systemic and local factors modulate each phase.

**Level 5**: Wound healing is orchestrated by growth factors (PDGF, TGF-beta, VEGF, EGF), cytokines, and cellular interactions. Matrix metalloproteinases regulate extracellular matrix remodeling. Chronic wounds often have elevated proteases, biofilm formation, and cellular senescence that disrupt normal healing cascades.
