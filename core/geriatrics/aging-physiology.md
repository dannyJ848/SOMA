# Aging Physiology

> Understanding the natural changes that occur as we age helps distinguish normal aging from disease and guides appropriate care decisions.

## Overview

Aging is a complex biological process involving gradual changes across all body systems. These changes occur at varying rates between individuals and are influenced by genetics, lifestyle, environment, and accumulated health experiences. Understanding normal aging empowers older adults and caregivers to maintain optimal function while recognizing when medical attention is needed.

## Normal Aging Changes by Body System

### Cardiovascular System

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
The heart and blood vessels change with age. The heart may become slightly larger and pump blood less efficiently during exercise. Blood vessels become stiffer, which can raise blood pressure. These changes are gradual and often don't cause symptoms in healthy aging.

## Homeostenosis: Reduced Physiologic Reserve

### Understanding Vulnerability

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding

- Renal: Baseline creatinine normal, AKI from minor insult
- Thermoregulation: Normal body temperature, hypothermia/hyperthermia risk
- Glucose: Fasting glucose normal, stress hyperglycemia

#### Level 3: Advanced Understanding
**Clinical Manifestations:**
- Atypical presentations of disease
- Cascade of complications from single insult
- Decompensation with surgery, infection, or new medication
- Slower recovery and rehabilitation

**Implications for Care:**
- Lower thresholds for concern
- Careful medication dosing
- Close monitoring during illness
- Extended recovery expectations
- Proactive rather than reactive approach

#### Level 4: Expert Understanding
**Biomarkers of Reserve:**
- Heart rate variability
- VO2 max decline
- Grip strength as global marker
- Gait speed as integration of multiple systems
- Inflammatory markers

**Stress Testing Concepts:**
- Unmasking latent disease
