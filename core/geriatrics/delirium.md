# Delirium: Acute Confusion in Older Adults

> Delirium is a medical emergency requiring urgent attention. This sudden state of confusion often signals serious underlying illness and is frequently reversible when promptly treated.

## Overview

Delirium is an acute, fluctuating disturbance in attention and awareness that develops over hours to days. Unlike dementia, which progresses slowly, delirium comes on suddenly and usually has an identifiable cause. It is common in hospitalized older adults, affecting up to 50% of those over 65. Recognition and treatment are urgent because delirium is associated with prolonged hospitalization, functional decline, institutionalization, and mortality.

## Understanding Delirium

### What Is Delirium?

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
Delirium is sudden confusion. The person may not know where they are, what day it is, or recognize family members. They may see or hear things that aren't there. Their level of alertness fluctuates - they may be agitated one moment and drowsy the next. This is different from dementia, which develops slowly over months or years.

**Warning signs for families:**
- Sudden change in mental status (within hours or days)
- Difficulty paying attention
- Disorganized thinking or speech
- Seeing or hearing things that aren't there
- Unusually agitated or unusually sleepy
- Worse in the evening or at night

**Delirium is:**
- Sudden (hours to days)
- Fluctuating (comes and goes)
- Usually reversible
- A sign that something is wrong medically

#### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding
**Core Features (DSM-5 Criteria):**
1. Disturbance in attention and awareness
2. Develops over hours to days, represents a change from baseline
3. Fluctuates throughout the day
4. Not better explained by pre-existing, established, or evolving dementia
5. Evidence that it's caused by a medical condition, substance, or multiple etiologies

**Subtypes by Motor Activity:**
- **Hyperactive delirium:** Agitated, restless, may be combative, hallucinating
  - More easily recognized
  - Often more distressing to observe
  - Better prognosis overall

- **Hypoactive delirium:** Quiet, withdrawn, sleepy, moves less
  - Often missed or mistaken for depression
  - More common in elderly
  - Associated with worse outcomes

- **Mixed delirium:** Alternates between hyperactive and hypoactive
  - Most common presentation

#### Level 3: Advanced Understanding
**Pathophysiology:**
- Neurotransmitter imbalances
  - Acetylcholine deficiency (primary)
  - Dopamine excess
  - GABA, glutamate, serotonin, norepinephrine alterations
- Neuroinflammation
- Oxidative stress
- Blood-brain barrier dysfunction
- Cortisol elevation (stress response)
- Circadian rhythm disruption

**Predisposing Factors (Baseline Vulnerability):**
- Advanced age (>65, especially >80)
- Pre-existing dementia (strongest risk factor)
- Prior delirium
- Functional impairment
- Sensory impairment (vision, hearing)
- Multiple comorbidities

#### Level 4: Expert Understanding
**Vulnerable Brain Model:**
- Baseline cognitive reserve determines susceptibility
- In frail elderly: Minor insult → Major delirium
- In robust young adult: Major insult required → Delirium less common
- Threshold concept: Sum of risk factors crosses threshold

**Neuroimaging Findings:**
- Acute: Often normal
- May show chronic changes (atrophy, white matter disease)
- Functional imaging shows widespread cortical dysfunction
- No specific diagnostic imaging finding

**Biomarkers (Research):**
- S100B, NSE (neuronal injury markers)

## Recognition and Assessment

### Identifying Delirium

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
Recognizing delirium quickly is essential because it often indicates serious illness. Healthcare providers use simple screening tests. Families are often the first to notice something is wrong because they know the person's normal behavior.

**Questions to help identify delirium:**
- Did this confusion start suddenly (within hours or days)?
- Does it come and go throughout the day?
- Is this different from their usual self?
- Can they pay attention to a conversation?
- Are they more confused at night?

#### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding
**CAM (Confusion Assessment Method):**
Most widely used delirium screening tool

**Feature 1:** Acute onset and fluctuating course
- Is there evidence of acute change from baseline?
- Does the behavior fluctuate during the day?

**Feature 2:** Inattention
- Does the patient have difficulty focusing attention?
- Are they easily distracted?
- Tested by: Days of week backward, serial 7s, digit span

**Feature 3:** Disorganized thinking
- Is thinking disorganized or incoherent?
- Rambling, illogical flow of ideas?

**Feature 4:** Altered level of consciousness
- Anything other than normal/alert
- Vigilant (hyper-alert), lethargic, stupor, coma

**Diagnosis:** Feature 1 + Feature 2 + (Feature 3 OR Feature 4)

#### Level 3: Advanced Understanding
**Other Assessment Tools:**
- **3D-CAM:** Brief version for non-ICU settings
- **CAM-ICU:** Adapted for intubated patients
- **4AT:** Quick (under 2 minutes) screening tool
- **MDAS:** Severity rating scale
- **DRS-R-98:** Detailed severity assessment

**Distinguishing Delirium from Dementia:**

| Feature | Delirium | Dementia |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Onset | Sudden (hours/days) | Gradual (months/years) |
| Course | Fluctuating | Stable throughout day |
| Attention | Impaired early | Usually preserved early |
| Consciousness | Altered | Usually clear |
| Hallucinations | Common, often visual | Less common, later stage |
| Duration | Days to weeks | Permanent |
| Reversibility | Usually reversible | Not reversible |

**Important:** Delirium often occurs on top of dementia. Patients with dementia are at much higher risk for delirium.

#### Level 4: Expert Understanding
**Subsyndromal Delirium:**
- Some features of delirium but doesn't meet full criteria
- Associated with worse outcomes than no delirium
- May progress to full delirium
- Warrants close monitoring

**Superimposed Delirium on Dementia:**
- Very common in hospitalized elderly
- Harder to recognize (what is baseline?)
- Caregiver/family input essential
- May indicate infection or other acute illness in dementia patient

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- Dementia alone
- Depression (hypoactive can look like)
- Psychotic disorders
- Non-convulsive status epilepticus
- Catatonia
- Focal neurological syndromes

## Management

### Prevention and Treatment

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
The best treatment for delirium is prevention. Simple measures like keeping the person oriented, ensuring they have glasses and hearing aids, staying hydrated, mobilizing early, and promoting sleep can significantly reduce delirium risk. When delirium occurs, finding and treating the cause is most important.

**Prevention basics:**
- Maintain regular routines
- Keep glasses and hearing aids in place
- Encourage fluids and nutrition
- Help with mobility and exercise
- Promote normal sleep patterns
- Limit unnecessary medications
- Family presence and orientation

#### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding
**HELP (Hospital Elder Life Program):**
Evidence-based multicomponent prevention program

**Components:**
1. Orientation (clocks, calendars, orientation board)
2. Cognitive stimulation activities
3. Early mobilization
4. Vision and hearing optimization
5. Dehydration prevention (hydration reminders)
6. Sleep enhancement (nonpharmacologic)

**Results:** 33% reduction in delirium incidence

**Finding the Cause:**
- Complete medication review
- Vital signs, oxygen saturation
- Blood tests: CBC, metabolic panel, urinalysis
- Consider: Chest X-ray, blood cultures, ECG
- Further testing based on clinical picture

#### Level 3: Advanced Understanding
**Nonpharmacological Management (First Line):**
- Orient repeatedly (gently, without arguing)
- Minimize environmental disruption
- Consistent caregivers
- Family at bedside
- Adequate lighting (bright day, dim night)
- Reduce noise
- Normalize sleep-wake cycle
- Remove restraints if possible
- Early mobilization
- Treat pain (avoid anticholinergic pain relievers)
- Correct sensory deficits (glasses, hearing aids, earwax removal)
- Maintain hydration and nutrition
- Avoid urinary catheters if possible
- Prevent constipation

**When Medications May Be Needed:**
- Severe agitation threatening safety
- Distressing hallucinations
- Interference with essential medical care
- When nonpharmacological approaches insufficient

**Medication Considerations:**
- Antipsychotics: Haloperidol, quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine
  - Low doses for shortest duration
  - Monitor for QTc prolongation
  - Avoid in Parkinson's and Lewy body dementia
- Avoid benzodiazepines (except alcohol/benzodiazepine withdrawal)

#### Level 4: Expert Understanding
**Evidence for Pharmacologic Treatment:**
- Limited evidence for antipsychotics reducing delirium severity/duration
- No evidence they reduce mortality
- May cause harm (especially in dementia, Parkinson's, Lewy body)
- Benzodiazepines may worsen non-withdrawal delirium
- Focus should remain on addressing underlying cause

**Special Populations:**

**Alcohol Withdrawal Delirium:**
- Benzodiazepines are treatment of choice
- CIWA protocol for monitoring
- Thiamine supplementation essential

**Lewy Body/Parkinson's:**
- Extreme caution with antipsychotics
- Quetiapine or clozapine if absolutely necessary
- Very low doses

**ICU Delirium:**
- ABCDEF bundle (Assess/prevent pain, Both SAT/SBT trials, Choice of sedation, Delirium assess/manage, Early mobility, Family engagement)
- Dexmedetomidine may be preferred for sedation
- Minimize benzodiazepines

**Palliative/End-of-Life:**
- Focus on comfort
- May use antipsychotics for distress
- Careful communication with family
- Terminal delirium may not be fully reversible

## Family Guidance

### Supporting Your Loved One Through Delirium

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
Watching a loved one experience delirium is frightening. They may not recognize you, may say hurtful things, or may seem like a different person. Remember: this is not the real them - it's their brain's temporary response to illness. Your presence and calm reassurance are powerful medicines.

**What you can do:**
- Stay calm and speak softly
- Remind them gently where they are and who you are
- Don't argue or try to convince them their experiences aren't real
- Keep the environment quiet and well-lit
- Bring familiar objects from home
- Stay with them when possible
- Report any sudden changes to staff

#### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding
**Communication Tips:**
- Use simple sentences
- Give one instruction at a time
- Allow time for response
- Validate their feelings ("I can see you're upset")
- Redirect conversation gently
- Avoid correcting misperceptions
- Use touch if comforting to them

**Practical Support:**
- Bring glasses, hearing aids, dentures
- Photos of family members
- Favorite music (softly)
- Familiar blanket or item
- Help maintain day-night rhythm (open blinds by day)

**Self-Care:**
- Take breaks - you can't help if you're exhausted
- Ask for help from other family members
- Talk to staff about what's happening
- This is not your fault

#### Level 3: Advanced Understanding
**What to Expect:**
- Delirium usually resolves over days to weeks
- Recovery may be gradual
- Some memory of the experience may remain
- Patients with dementia may not return to their exact previous baseline
- Follow-up cognitive assessment is important

**When to Alert Staff:**
- New or worsening confusion
