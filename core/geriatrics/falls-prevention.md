# Falls and Fall Prevention in Older Adults

> Falls are not a normal part of aging. Most falls can be prevented through identification of risk factors and targeted interventions. A single fall can be life-changing, but proactive steps can significantly reduce risk.

## Overview

Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death and nonfatal injuries among adults aged 65 and older. Each year, approximately one in four older adults falls, and fall rates increase with age. Falls cause 95% of hip fractures and are a leading cause of traumatic brain injury. Yet falls are largely preventable. Understanding risk factors and implementing evidence-based interventions can help older adults maintain their independence and safety.

## Understanding Falls

### Why Falls Matter

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
Falls are common in older adults but are not inevitable. They can cause serious injuries including broken bones and head injuries. Even falls without injury can lead to fear of falling, which causes people to become less active and more vulnerable to future falls. The good news: most falls can be prevented.

**Key facts:**
- 1 in 4 adults 65+ falls each year
- Less than half tell their doctor
- Falls are the #1 cause of injury death in older adults
- 95% of hip fractures result from falls
- Most falls are preventable

#### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding
**Consequences of Falls:**

**Physical:**
- Fractures (hip, wrist, spine, pelvis)
- Head injuries (subdural hematoma, traumatic brain injury)
- Soft tissue injuries
- Hospitalization
- Loss of independence

**Psychological:**
- Fear of falling
- Activity restriction
- Loss of confidence
- Anxiety and depression
- Social isolation

**Economic:**
- Medical costs (billions annually)
- Long-term care needs
- Caregiver burden
- Lost productivity

**The Cascade:**
Fall → Injury or Fear → Reduced Activity → Deconditioning → Increased Fall Risk → More Falls

#### Level 3: Advanced Understanding
**Epidemiology:**
- Fall incidence increases with age (28% at 65-74, 35% at 75+)
- Women fall more often; men have higher fall mortality
- 20-30% of falls cause moderate to severe injury
- Nursing home residents: 50% fall annually
- Post-fall mortality: 50% within 1 year after hip fracture (in frail elderly)

**Biomechanics of Falls:**
- Direction of fall influences injury type
- Sideways falls → hip fractures
- Forward falls → wrist fractures
- Backward falls → head injuries
- Protective responses decline with age
- Osteoporosis increases fracture risk at lower impact forces

## Risk Factors

### Identifying Who Is at Risk

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
Many factors increase fall risk. Some you can change (like medication side effects), and some you cannot (like age). The more risk factors you have, the higher your risk of falling. Knowing your personal risk factors is the first step toward prevention.

**Common risk factors:**
- Previous falls
- Muscle weakness
- Balance problems
- Vision problems
- Multiple medications
- Home hazards
- Fear of falling

#### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding
**Intrinsic Risk Factors (Within the Person):**

- Fear of falling
- Age >80

**Medical conditions:**
- Cognitive impairment/dementia
- Stroke
- Parkinson's disease
- Arthritis
- Diabetes (neuropathy)
- Depression
- Vitamin D deficiency
- Anemia

| Low | No falls in past year, normal gait/balance | ~10% |
| Moderate | 1 fall in past year OR gait/balance problem | ~20-30% |
| High | 2+ falls OR fall with injury | ~40-60% |

**Multifactorial Nature:**
- Falls rarely have a single cause
- Average older adult has 2-3 risk factors
- Risk increases multiplicatively, not additively
- Both acute and chronic factors contribute

**Acute Precipitants:**
- Acute illness (infection, dehydration)
- New medication
- Acute pain
- Postural hypotension
- Syncope
- Environmental challenges

#### Level 4: Expert Understanding
**Medications of Particular Concern:**

High-risk medication classes:
- Benzodiazepines (OR 1.4-1.8)
- Z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone)
- Antipsychotics
- Antidepressants (including SSRIs)
- Opioids
- Anticonvulsants
- Antihypertensives (especially if causing orthostatic hypotension)

**Screening Tools:**
- Timed Up and Go (TUG): >12 seconds = increased risk
- 30-Second Chair Stand: <8 stands = increased risk
- 4-Stage Balance Test: Unable to hold tandem 10 seconds = increased risk
- STEADI algorithm (CDC)

**Gait Analysis:**
- Decreased gait speed (<0.8 m/s)
- Increased gait variability
- Decreased stride length
- Wider base of support
- Reduced arm swing
- "Cautious gait" pattern

## Assessment

### Evaluating Fall Risk

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
Everyone over 65 should be asked about falls at least once a year. If you've fallen, your doctor should do a thorough evaluation. This includes checking your strength, balance, vision, medications, and home environment. Don't be embarrassed to report falls - this information helps prevent future falls.

**Questions your doctor should ask:**
- Have you fallen in the past year?
- Do you feel unsteady when standing or walking?
- Are you afraid of falling?

#### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding
**Comprehensive Fall Evaluation:**

**History:**
- Number of falls in past year
- Circumstances of falls (when, where, what doing)
- Symptoms before fall (dizziness, weakness, palpitations)
- Loss of consciousness?
- Injuries sustained
- Fear of falling
- Activity limitations
- Medication review

**Physical Examination:**
- Vital signs including orthostatic blood pressures
- Vision screening
- Cardiovascular exam
- Neurological exam (strength, sensation, reflexes)
- Musculoskeletal exam (joints, feet)
- Gait and balance assessment

**Functional Assessment:**
- Timed Up and Go
- Chair stand test
- Balance testing
- Gait observation

#### Level 3: Advanced Understanding
**Orthostatic Hypotension Assessment:**
- Measure BP supine (or seated) and after standing 1-3 minutes
- Orthostatic hypotension: Systolic drop ≥20 mmHg or diastolic ≥10 mmHg
- Symptomatic vs. asymptomatic
- May need prolonged standing assessment

**When to Consider Additional Testing:**
- ECG: Syncope, palpitations, known cardiac disease
- 24-hour Holter: Unexplained syncope
- Echocardiogram: Suspected cardiac cause
- Blood tests: CBC (anemia), glucose, electrolytes, vitamin D, B12, TSH
- Brain imaging: Focal neurological signs, head injury, unexplained cognitive changes

**Vestibular Assessment:**
- Dix-Hallpike maneuver (BPPV)
- Head impulse test
- Romberg test
- Consider referral for vestibular rehabilitation

**Vision Assessment:**
- Visual acuity
- Contrast sensitivity
- Depth perception
- Peripheral vision
- Referral to ophthalmology if needed

#### Level 4: Expert Understanding
**Syncope vs. Mechanical Fall:**
- Important to distinguish (different treatment)
- Syncope: Loss of consciousness, usually cardiac or autonomic
- Mechanical fall: No LOC, environmental/intrinsic cause
- "Unexplained falls" in elderly may actually be syncope

**Cardiac Evaluation for Unexplained Falls:**
- ECG (arrhythmia, heart block, QT prolongation)
- Consider echo, Holter, event monitor, electrophysiology study
- Carotid sinus hypersensitivity (carotid sinus massage with monitoring)

**Specialist Referrals:**
- Cardiology: Suspected cardiac cause
- Neurology: Parkinsonism, neuropathy, vestibular disorders
- Ophthalmology: Visual impairment
- Physical therapy: Gait/balance disorders
- Geriatrics: Complex, multifactorial falls

## Prevention Strategies

### Evidence-Based Interventions

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
Most falls can be prevented. The best approach combines exercise (especially balance and strength training), medication review, vision correction, and home safety improvements. A combination of strategies works better than any single intervention.

**Key prevention strategies:**
- Exercise regularly (especially balance and strength)
- Have your medications reviewed
- Get your vision checked
- Make your home safer

- Duration: At least 50 hours total, 2+ hours per week
- Ongoing participation needed for continued benefit

**Specific programs:**
- Tai Chi: 20-40% fall reduction
- Otago Exercise Program: 35% fall reduction
- Matter of Balance: Addresses fear of falling
- Stepping On: Community-based, multicomponent

**Medication Review:**
- Reduce polypharmacy when possible
- Taper or discontinue high-risk medications
- Minimize psychoactive medications
- Avoid anticholinergics
- Review cardiovascular medications (orthostasis)

**Vision:**
- Annual eye exams
- Update glasses prescription
- Cataract surgery when indicated
- Avoid bifocals/progressives on stairs
- Good lighting in home

#### Level 3: Advanced Understanding
**Home Safety Modifications:**

**High-yield interventions:**
- Grab bars in bathroom (tub, shower, toilet)
- Non-slip mats in tub/shower
- Improved lighting (especially stairs, nighttime paths)
- Remove loose rugs or secure edges
- Clear clutter from walkways
- Handrails on both sides of stairs
- Night lights
- Raised toilet seat if needed

**Professional home assessment:**

- Example: Exercise + education + home safety for everyone

**Multifactorial:** Individualized based on assessment
- Example: Each person gets interventions targeting their specific risk factors
- Requires comprehensive assessment
- More resource-intensive
- Evidence mixed but generally positive

**CDC STEADI Initiative:**
1. Screen (fall history, unsteadiness, fear of falling)
2. Assess (falls history, medications, feet/footwear, orthostatic vitals, vision, gait/balance, vitamin D)
3. Intervene (targeted interventions based on assessment)

**Vitamin D Supplementation:**
- Evidence mixed
- May benefit those with deficiency
- 800-1000 IU daily commonly recommended
- Higher doses not more effective and may be harmful

**Hip Protectors:**
- External pads worn over hips
- Mixed evidence for efficacy
- May reduce hip fracture risk in compliant wearers
- Compliance is a major barrier

## Management After a Fall

### Post-Fall Assessment and Care

#### Level 1: Basic Understanding
Every fall deserves attention, even if there's no apparent injury. Some injuries (like bleeding in the brain) may not be obvious immediately. After a fall, see your doctor for an evaluation. This is also an opportunity to identify why the fall happened and prevent future falls.

**After a fall:**
- Check for injuries (pain, swelling, difficulty moving)
- Get medical attention if injured or if taking blood thinners
- Tell your doctor about the fall
- Try to understand why it happened
- Take steps to prevent future falls

#### Level 2: Intermediate Understanding
**Immediate Assessment:**
- Injuries (fractures, head injury, lacerations)
- Was there loss of consciousness?
- Can the person get up safely?
- Are they on anticoagulants? (higher bleeding risk)

**Red Flags Requiring Emergency Evaluation:**
- Head injury (especially on blood thinners)
- Loss of consciousness
- Severe pain suggesting fracture
- Inability to bear weight
- New neurological symptoms
- Significant bleeding

**Post-Fall Medical Evaluation:**

- Delayed subdural hematoma can occur

**Fall-related Fractures:**
- Hip: Usually obvious, can't bear weight
- Wrist: Colles fracture common
- Spine: May present as back pain, can be missed
- Pelvic: May be missed, groin/buttock pain
- Consider imaging if significant pain

#### Level 4: Expert Understanding
**Post-Fall Syndrome:**
- Fear of falling
- Activity restriction
- Loss of confidence
- Depression
- Self-imposed immobility
- Deconditioning
- Increased fall risk

**Intervention:**
- Cognitive behavioral approaches
- Gradual exposure to activity
- Matter of Balance or similar programs
- Physical therapy
- Address depression/anxiety

**Quality Improvement:**
- Fall as quality indicator in healthcare settings
- Root cause analysis
- Systems approaches to prevention
- Post-fall huddles in hospitals/nursing homes
