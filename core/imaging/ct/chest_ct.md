## Introduction

### What is a Chest CT?

Chest CT uses X-rays and computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional images of the lungs, heart, mediastinum, and chest wall. It provides far more detail than chest X-ray and is essential for diagnosing many thoracic conditions.

### Indications

**Emergency Indications:**
- Suspected pulmonary embolism (PE)
- Aortic dissection
- Chest trauma
- Hemoptysis evaluation
- Severe pneumonia not responding to treatment

**Elective Indications:**
- Lung nodule characterization/follow-up
- Lung cancer staging
- Interstitial lung disease evaluation
- Mediastinal mass workup
- Preoperative planning
- Lung cancer screening (high-risk patients)

### Radiation Dose

| Study | Effective Dose (mSv) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Chest X-ray | 0.02 |
| Low-dose CT (screening) | 1-2 |
| Standard Chest CT | 7 |
| CT Angiography | 10-15 |

## How Chest CT Works

### Patient-Friendly Explanation

"A chest CT takes detailed pictures of your lungs, heart, and the surrounding structures. You'll lie on a table that moves through a doughnut-shaped scanner. The scan takes just a few seconds and you may need to hold your breath briefly. Some scans require contrast dye injected into your vein to highlight blood vessels."

### Technical Principles

**Hounsfield Units (HU):**
- Air: -1000 HU (black)
- Fat: -100 HU
- Water: 0 HU
- Soft tissue: 40-80 HU
- Bone: +1000 HU (white)

**Contrast Enhancement:**
- Iodinated contrast for vascular studies
- Timing determines what is opacified
- Arterial phase: Pulmonary arteries (PE protocol)
- Mixed phase: Aorta and pulmonary vessels

---

### Window Settings

| Window | Width (W) | Level (L) | Use |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Lung | 1500 | -600 | Lung parenchyma |
| Mediastinum | 400 | 40 | Soft tissue, mediastinum |
| Bone | 2000 | 400 | Ribs, spine |
