## Introduction

### What is a Head CT?

A head CT (computed tomography) uses X-rays and computer processing to create detailed cross-sectional images of the brain, skull, and surrounding structures. It is the first-line imaging study for many acute neurological presentations.

### Indications

**Emergency Indications:**
- Acute stroke symptoms (time-critical)
- Head trauma
- Severe headache ("worst headache of life")
- Altered mental status
- New focal neurological deficit
- Seizures (first presentation or status)
- Suspected intracranial hemorrhage
- Pre-lumbar puncture (papilledema, focal signs)

**Non-Emergency Indications:**
- Chronic headache evaluation
- Dementia workup
- Follow-up of known lesions
- Pre-operative planning
- Shunt evaluation

### Advantages Over MRI

| Advantage | Clinical Relevance |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Speed | Completed in minutes |
| Availability | 24/7 in most hospitals |
| Cost | Lower than MRI |
| Hemorrhage detection | Excellent for acute blood |
| Bone detail | Superior to MRI |
| Patient factors | OK with pacemakers, claustrophobia |

### Limitations

- Radiation exposure
- Limited soft tissue contrast (compared to MRI)
- Posterior fossa artifacts
- Cannot detect hyperacute ischemic stroke
- Poor for white matter disease

### Radiation Dose

| Study | Effective Dose (mSv) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Head CT (non-contrast) | 2 |
| Head CT with contrast | 2-4 |
| Head CTA | 3-5 |

## How Head CT Works

### Patient-Friendly Explanation

"A CT scan takes many X-ray pictures from different angles around your head. A computer combines these pictures to create detailed 'slices' showing your brain, like looking at slices of bread in a loaf. This helps us see problems like bleeding, swelling, or tumors that we couldn't see on a regular X-ray."

### Technical Principles

**CT Density (Hounsfield Units - HU):**
- Water = 0 HU (reference)
- Air = -1000 HU (black)
- Fat = -100 HU (dark gray)
- Brain = 20-40 HU (gray)
- Blood (acute) = 50-100 HU (bright)
- Bone = +1000 HU (white)

**Key Terms:**
- **Hypodense/Hypodensity**: Darker than surrounding tissue (lower HU)
- **Hyperdense/Hyperdensity**: Brighter than surrounding tissue (higher HU)
- **Isodense**: Same density as surrounding tissue

### Contrast Enhancement

**Indications for IV Contrast:**
- Tumor evaluation
- Infection/abscess
- Vascular malformations
- Some stroke protocols (CTA)

**Contraindications:**
- Contrast allergy (relative)
- Renal insufficiency (eGFR <30)
- Pregnancy (relative)

---

## Protocols and Techniques

### Non-Contrast Head CT (NCCT)

**Standard Protocol:**
- Axial images from skull base to vertex
- Slice thickness: 5mm (routine) or 2.5mm (stroke)
- Window settings crucial for interpretation

**Window Settings:**

| Window | Width (W) | Level (L) | Best For |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Brain | 80-100 | 35-40 | Parenchyma, gray-white differentiation |
| Subdural | 150-200 | 50-80 | Subtle extra-axial collections |
| Bone | 2000-4000 | 500-700 | Skull fractures, sinus disease |
| Stroke | 30-40 | 30-35 | Early ischemic changes |

### CT Angiography (CTA)

**Purpose:**
- Evaluate intracranial vessels
- Detect aneurysms, stenosis, occlusion
- Part of acute stroke protocol

**Technique:**
- Bolus IV contrast injection
- Timing for arterial phase
- Images from aortic arch to vertex
- 3D reconstructions

### CT Perfusion (CTP)

**Purpose:**
- Assess cerebral blood flow
- Identify ischemic penumbra vs. core infarct
- Guide stroke treatment decisions

**Parameters:**
- CBF (cerebral blood flow)
- CBV (cerebral blood volume)
- MTT (mean transit time)
- Tmax (time to maximum)

**Interpretation:**
- Core infarct: Low CBF + Low CBV
- Penumbra: Low CBF + Normal/Elevated CBV
- Mismatch: Guides intervention decisions

## Systematic Interpretation Approach

### The "BLOOD CAN BE BAD" Method

#### B - Blood

**Look for:**
- Intraparenchymal hemorrhage
- Epidural hematoma
- Subdural hematoma
- Subarachnoid hemorrhage
- Intraventricular hemorrhage

**Remember:**
- Acute blood is HYPERDENSE (bright)
- Blood becomes isodense over days-weeks
- Chronic blood is HYPODENSE (dark)

#### L - Lesions

**Assess:**
- Mass lesions
- Ring-enhancing lesions
- Calcifications
- Cysts

#### O - Orbits and Sinuses

**Check:**
- Orbit integrity
- Air-fluid levels in sinuses
- Mastoid air cells

#### O - Outside (Extra-axial Spaces)

**Evaluate:**
- Scalp soft tissues
- Epidural space
- Subdural space
- Subarachnoid space

#### D - Density of Brain

**Gray-White Differentiation:**
- Normally, gray matter is slightly denser than white matter
- Loss of differentiation = acute ischemia

#### C - Cisterns

**Key Cisterns:**
- Suprasellar cistern
- Quadrigeminal cistern
- Ambient cisterns
- Perimesencephalic cistern

**Assessment:**
- Should be patent (filled with CSF)
- Effacement suggests mass effect/herniation
- Blood in cisterns = SAH

#### A - Asymmetry

**Compare:**
- Ventricle size
- Sulcal pattern
- Hemisphere size
- Midline shift

#### N - Narrowing of Ventricles/Sulci

**Evaluate:**
- Effacement of sulci (edema)
- Compressed ventricles (mass effect)
- Enlarged ventricles (hydrocephalus)

#### B - Bone

**Check:**
- Skull fractures
- Erosions
- Hyperostosis
- Lytic lesions

#### E - Evidence of Mass Effect

**Signs:**
- Midline shift (>5mm concerning)
- Ventricular compression
- Sulcal effacement
- Herniation syndromes

#### B - Bleeding (Again!)

**Recheck all spaces for blood**

#### A - Air (Abnormal)

**Pneumocephalus:**
- Indicates communication with outside
- Trauma, post-surgical, infection

#### D - Development/Differentiation

**Assess:**
- Age-appropriate changes
- Atrophy pattern
- White matter changes

## Stroke Imaging

### Ischemic Stroke

#### Time Course of CT Findings

| Time | CT Findings |
|------|-------------|
| 0-6 hours | May be normal; look for early signs |
| 6-24 hours | Hypodensity becomes visible |
| 1-7 days | Edema peaks, mass effect |
| 1-2 weeks | "Fogging effect" (isodense) |
| >2 weeks | Encephalomalacia, volume loss |

#### Early Ischemic Signs (<6 hours)

**ASPECTS Score (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score):**
- 10 regions assessed in MCA territory
- 1 point deducted for each affected region
- Score 0-10 (10 = normal)
- Score <7 suggests large infarct, worse prognosis

**Early Signs to Detect:**

| Sign | Description | Image Appearance |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Loss of gray-white differentiation | Insular ribbon sign, loss of basal ganglia outline | Isodensity where difference should exist |
| Sulcal effacement | Swelling of gyri | Sulci appear "full" or absent |
| Hyperdense vessel sign | Clot in artery | Bright vessel (MCA, basilar) |
| Loss of insular ribbon | Insular cortex becomes isodense to white matter | Obscured insular cortex |
| Obscured lentiform nucleus | Basal ganglia edema | Loss of definition of putamen |

#### Hyperdense MCA Sign

- Acute clot in MCA appears hyperdense
- Indicates large vessel occlusion
- Compare to contralateral side
- Calcification of vessel can mimic

#### Infarct Patterns by Territory

- Linear pattern at boundaries

**Lacunar Infarcts:**
- Small (<1.5 cm) deep infarcts
- Basal ganglia, thalamus, pons
- Due to small vessel disease

### Hemorrhagic Transformation

**Classification:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| HI1 | Small petechiae along infarct margins |
| HI2 | More confluent petechiae within infarct |
| PH1 | Hematoma <30% of infarct with mild mass effect |
| PH2 | Hematoma >30% of infarct with significant mass effect |

- Skull fracture tears vessel
- Blood between skull and dura

**CT Appearance:**
- Biconvex (lens-shaped)
- Hyperdense (acute)
- Does NOT cross suture lines (dura attached at sutures)
- May cross midline (unlike subdural)
- Often associated skull fracture

**Clinical Correlation:**

- Temporal location most common
- Neurosurgical emergency

### Subdural Hematoma (SDH)

**Mechanism:**
- Usually venous (bridging veins)
- Blood between dura and arachnoid
- Common in elderly, alcoholics, anticoagulation

**CT Appearance:**
