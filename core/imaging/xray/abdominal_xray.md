## Introduction

### What is an Abdominal X-Ray?

An abdominal X-ray (AXR), also called a KUB (Kidneys, Ureters, Bladder), is a plain radiograph of the abdomen. It provides a quick, low-cost overview of abdominal contents with relatively low radiation exposure.

### Indications

**Common Indications:**
- Suspected bowel obstruction
- Suspected perforation (free air)
- Foreign body ingestion/insertion
- Assessment of tube positions
- Constipation evaluation
- Suspected toxic megacolon
- Renal/ureteric calculi (limited sensitivity)
- Abdominal pain workup (initial study)

**Less Common:**
- Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening (calcification)
- Evaluation of surgical clips/devices
- Ingested packets (body packing)

### Limitations

**What AXR Does NOT Show Well:**
- Solid organ pathology (liver, spleen, kidneys)
- Soft tissue masses
- Most gallstones (only 10-15% calcified)
- Most kidney stones (better seen on CT)
- Appendicitis
- Pancreatitis
- Early obstruction

**When CT is Better:**
- Suspected appendicitis
- Trauma
- Mass lesions
- Complex bowel obstruction
- Most acute abdominal emergencies

### Radiation Dose

| Study | Effective Dose (mSv) |
|-------|---------------------|
| Abdominal X-ray | 0.7 |
| CT Abdomen/Pelvis | 10 |

## How Abdominal X-Ray Works

### Patient-Friendly Explanation

"An abdominal X-ray takes a picture of your belly using the same type of energy as a chest X-ray. Different structures absorb X-rays differently:
- **Gas in bowel** appears BLACK (air doesn't block X-rays)
- **Bones** (spine, pelvis) appear WHITE
- **Soft organs** (liver, kidneys) appear GRAY
- **Calcium** (stones, calcifications) appears WHITE
- **Fat** appears slightly darker than organs

This helps us see the pattern of gas in your intestines, spot blockages, find stones, and identify other problems."

### Technical Principles

- X-rays pass through the body
- Differential absorption creates contrast
- Dense structures (bone, calcium) block more X-rays = WHITE
- Less dense structures (fat) block fewer X-rays = DARK GRAY
- Gas blocks almost no X-rays = BLACK

## Views and Positioning

### Supine View (AP Abdomen)

**Standard View:**
- Patient lying flat on back
- X-ray beam from above (anterior to posterior)
- Includes diaphragm to symphysis pubis

**Advantages:**
- Comfortable for patient
- Good for overall assessment
- Standard baseline view

**Limitations:**
- Free air may not be visible (rises to anterior abdomen)
- Fluid levels not visible

### Upright/Erect View

**Positioning:**
- Patient standing or sitting upright
- Include both hemidiaphragms

**Key Uses:**
- Detect free intraperitoneal air (under diaphragm)
- Demonstrate air-fluid levels (bowel obstruction)
- Assess for ileus pattern

**Requirements:**
- Patient upright for at least 5-10 minutes before imaging
- Must include hemidiaphragms

### Left Lateral Decubitus

**Positioning:**
- Patient lying on LEFT side
- X-ray beam horizontal

**Uses:**
- When patient cannot stand
- Free air rises to RIGHT side (away from gastric bubble)
- Can detect small amounts of free air

### Three-View Acute Abdominal Series

**Components:**
1. Supine abdominal X-ray
2. Upright abdominal X-ray (or left lateral decubitus)
3. Upright chest X-ray (most sensitive for free air)

**Indications:**
- Acute abdomen
- Suspected perforation
- Suspected obstruction

## Systematic Interpretation Approach

### The "GGBOBSTIF" Method

#### G - Gas Pattern

**Normal Gas Pattern:**
- Small amount of gas in stomach
- Variable gas in colon
- Minimal or no small bowel gas
- No gas outside bowel lumen

**Abnormal Gas Patterns:**

| Pattern | Description | Significance |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Dilated small bowel | >3 cm diameter, central location, valvulae conniventes | Obstruction or ileus |
| Dilated large bowel | >6 cm diameter, peripheral, haustra | Obstruction or ileus |
| Massive cecal dilation | >9 cm | Impending perforation |
| Gasless abdomen | No bowel gas visible | Fluid-filled bowel, ascites |
| Free air | Air outside bowel lumen | Perforation |

#### G - Growths/Masses

**Assessment:**
- Soft tissue densities displacing bowel
- Loss of normal fat planes
- Obscured organ margins

**Common Findings:**
- Enlarged liver (pushing bowel down and left)
- Enlarged spleen (pushing stomach medially)
- Pelvic masses (displacing bowel superiorly)
- Retroperitoneal masses

#### B - Bones

**Structures to Evaluate:**
- Lumbar spine
- Sacrum and coccyx

- Ureter crosses: L4-L5 transverse process, sacroiliac joint, ischial spine, bladder
- Must differentiate from phleboliths

**Bladder Stones:**
- Central pelvic location
- May be layered appearance

**Differentiating Ureteric Stone from Phlebolith:**

| Feature | Ureteric Stone | Phlebolith |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| Location | Along ureter course | Pelvis, scattered |
| Shape | Round/oval, solid | Round with lucent center |
| Associated symptoms | Renal colic | None |
| Number | Usually few | Often multiple |

#### Appendicolith

**Findings:**
- Round calcification in right lower quadrant
- ~10% of appendicitis cases
- When present, indicates higher risk of perforation

**Description:**
- Small round calcific density
- Located at expected position of appendix (RLQ)
- May be single or multiple

#### Pancreatic Calcifications

**Findings:**
- Stippled calcifications in epigastric region
- Following pancreatic axis
- Indicates chronic pancreatitis

#### Vascular Calcifications

**Aortic Calcification:**
- Linear calcification
- Paravertebral location
- If aneurysmal: calcified wall separated from spine by soft tissue

**AAA on AXR:**
- Curvilinear calcification
- >3 cm from wall to wall suggests aneurysm
- If symptomatic, requires urgent CT

## Clinical Correlations

### Acute Abdominal Pain Algorithm

**Initial AXR Findings and Next Steps:**

| Finding | Likely Diagnosis | Next Step |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Dilated small bowel, no colon gas | SBO | CT to confirm, surgical consult |
| Dilated colon, coffee bean sign | Sigmoid volvulus | Sigmoidoscopy/surgical consult |
| Free air under diaphragm | Perforated viscus | Urgent surgical consult, CT |
| RLQ calcification + pain | Appendicitis with appendicolith | CT appendix |
| Normal AXR with RIF pain | Early appendicitis | CT or ultrasound |
| Diffuse dilation | Ileus | Treat underlying cause |
| Fecal loading | Constipation | Conservative management |

### Constipation Assessment

**Fecal Loading Grading:**

| Grade | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| None | No feces visible |
| Mild | Feces in rectosigmoid only |
| Moderate | Feces extending to splenic flexure |
| Severe | Feces throughout colon |

**Additional Findings in Constipation:**

## Special Situations

### Pediatric Abdominal X-Ray

**Key Differences:**
- More bowel gas is normal (aerophagia)
- Smaller bowel diameter norms
- Different pathology spectrum

**Common Pediatric Findings:**

| Finding | Diagnosis |
|---------|-----------|
| "Double bubble" sign | Duodenal atresia |
| Multiple dilated loops with air-fluid levels | Distal bowel atresia |
| Ground glass abdomen with calcifications | Meconium peritonitis |
| Gasless abdomen | Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis |
| Intussusception soft tissue mass | Intussusception |

### Pregnancy

**Considerations:**
- Avoid if possible (radiation exposure)
- Shield if necessary
- Ultrasound preferred for most indications
- May be appropriate for SBO evaluation

### Post-operative Abdomen

**Normal Findings:**
- Free air persists 7-10 days post-laparotomy
- Longer if large amount or patient obese
- Ileus pattern common in early post-op period
- Surgical clips and devices visible

**Concerning Findings:**
- Increasing free air after initial decrease
- New air-fluid levels
- Worsening bowel dilation
- Loss of normal gas pattern

---

## Comparison and Follow-up

### When to Repeat AXR

**Indications for Serial Films:**
- Monitoring SBO (resolving vs. worsening)
- Tracking volvulus decompression
- Following toxic megacolon
- Confirming tube positions after adjustment

### CT vs. AXR

**When CT is Preferred:**

| Scenario | Preferred Imaging |
|----------|-------------------|
| Suspected appendicitis | CT |
| Trauma | CT |
| Mesenteric ischemia | CT angiography |
| Complicated SBO | CT |
| Mass evaluation | CT |
| Kidney stones | CT (non-contrast) |

## Summary Checklist

### Before Signing Off

- [ ] Checked gas pattern (small bowel vs. large bowel)
- [ ] Looked for free air (under diaphragms, Rigler's sign)
- [ ] Assessed calcifications (vascular, urinary, other)
- [ ] Checked bones (spine, pelvis)
- [ ] Evaluated organ shadows (kidneys, psoas, liver)
- [ ] Confirmed tube positions if present
- [ ] Compared to prior studies
- [ ] Provided clinical correlation
- [ ] Recommended follow-up imaging if needed

### Common Pitfalls

1. **Missing subtle free air** - Always check upright or decubitus views
2. **Calling phleboliths ureteric stones** - Look for central lucency
3. **Missing sigmoid volvulus** - Look for coffee bean sign
4. **Overlooking appendicolith** - Check RLQ carefully
5. **Ignoring bones** - Metastatic disease may be first finding
6. **Not recognizing ileus** - Differentiate from obstruction
7. **Forgetting post-op context** - Free air may be normal
