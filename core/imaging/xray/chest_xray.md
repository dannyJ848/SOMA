## Introduction

### What is a Chest X-Ray?

A chest X-ray (CXR) is the most commonly performed radiological examination worldwide. It uses a small amount of ionizing radiation to create images of the structures within the chest, including the lungs, heart, blood vessels, airways, and bones of the chest wall.

### Indications

**Emergency Indications:**
- Suspected pneumonia
- Chest trauma
- Shortness of breath
- Chest pain
- Suspected pneumothorax
- Foreign body aspiration
- Post-procedure evaluation (central line, intubation)

**Routine/Elective Indications:**
- Pre-operative assessment
- Follow-up of known lung disease
- Screening for tuberculosis
- Evaluation of chronic cough
- Assessment of cardiac size
- Monitoring cancer treatment response

### Contraindications

- **Absolute**: None (benefit almost always outweighs minimal radiation risk)
- **Relative**: Pregnancy (shield abdomen, use only if clinically necessary)

### Radiation Dose

| Study | Effective Dose (mSv) | Equivalent Background Radiation |
|-------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| Chest X-ray PA | 0.02 | 2.4 days |
| Chest X-ray Lateral | 0.04 | 5 days |
| For comparison: CT Chest | 7.0 | 2.3 years |

## How Chest X-Ray Works

### Patient-Friendly Explanation

"A chest X-ray is like taking a photograph of the inside of your chest. X-rays are a form of energy that can pass through your body. Different tissues absorb different amounts of X-rays:
- **Bones** absorb most X-rays and appear WHITE
- **Air** (in lungs) absorbs almost no X-rays and appears BLACK
- **Soft tissues** (heart, blood vessels) absorb some X-rays and appear GRAY
- **Fat** appears darker gray
- **Metal** (jewelry, implants) absorbs all X-rays and appears BRIGHT WHITE"

### Technical Principles

1. **X-ray Generation**: High-voltage electricity accelerates electrons toward a tungsten target, producing X-rays
2. **Patient Positioning**: X-ray beam passes through the patient
3. **Image Detection**: Digital detector or film captures transmitted X-rays
4. **Image Formation**: Differential absorption creates contrast between structures

### The Five Basic Densities

1. **Air/Gas** (black) - Lowest density
2. **Fat** (dark gray)
3. **Soft tissue/Fluid** (gray)
4. **Bone/Calcium** (white)
5. **Metal** (bright white) - Highest density

## Views and Positioning

### Posterior-Anterior (PA) View

**Standard view of choice for ambulatory patients**

**Positioning:**
- Patient stands facing the detector
- Arms raised, hands on hips, shoulders rolled forward
- X-ray beam enters from BACK (posterior), exits through FRONT (anterior)
- 6-foot (180 cm) source-to-image distance

**Advantages:**
- Minimizes heart magnification (heart is anterior, closer to detector)
- Scapulae are rotated out of lung fields
- Best assessment of cardiac size

**Description of Normal PA Image:**
- Heart appears normal size
- Clear lung fields bilaterally
- Visible costophrenic angles
- Trachea midline
- Both hemidiaphragms visible

### Anterior-Posterior (AP) View

**Used for portable/bedside X-rays in patients who cannot stand**

**Positioning:**
- Patient supine or sitting up in bed
- Detector behind patient's back
- X-ray beam enters from FRONT (anterior)
- Shorter source-to-image distance (typically 40 inches)

**Limitations:**
- Heart appears magnified (farther from detector)
- Scapulae may overlap lung fields
- Mediastinum appears wider
- Cannot reliably assess cardiomegaly
- Lung bases may be obscured

**Image Characteristics:**
- Usually labeled "AP" or "Portable"
- Heart appears larger than on PA
- Scapulae visible over lung fields
- Patient may be rotated

### Lateral View

**Complementary view for better 3D localization**

**Positioning:**
- Patient's left side against detector (left lateral)
- Arms raised above head
- X-ray beam passes from right to left

**Indications:**
- Localize lesions seen on PA view
- Evaluate retrosternal/retrocardiac areas
- Assess vertebral bodies
- Evaluate posterior costophrenic angles
- Confirm presence of pleural effusion

**Normal Anatomy on Lateral:**
- Vertebral bodies should become MORE lucent (darker) inferiorly
- Retrosternal space should be clear
- Posterior hemidiaphragm is higher (right)
- Heart silhouette visible anteriorly

### Additional Views

**Lordotic View:**
- Patient leans backward
- Better visualization of lung apices
- Used when apex is obscured by clavicle/ribs

**Decubitus View:**
- Patient lies on side (affected side down)
- Evaluates for mobile pleural fluid
- Small effusions layer along dependent chest wall

**Expiratory View:**
- Image taken at end of expiration
- Accentuates small pneumothorax
- Evaluates air trapping

## Technical Quality Assessment

### RIPE Criteria

Before interpreting, assess image quality using **RIPE**:

#### R - Rotation

**Assessment:**
- Compare distance from medial clavicle ends to spinous processes
- Should be equal on both sides

**Effects of Rotation:**
- Mediastinum appears shifted
- One lung appears more lucent than the other
- May simulate pathology

**Description:**
- Well-positioned: Clavicular heads equidistant from spinous process
- Rotated right: Left clavicular head farther from spine
- Rotated left: Right clavicular head farther from spine

#### I - Inspiration

**Assessment:**
- Count posterior ribs visible above diaphragm
- Good inspiration: 9-10 posterior ribs or 5-6 anterior ribs visible

**Effects of Poor Inspiration:**
- Heart appears enlarged
- Lung bases appear hazy (atelectasis)
- Pulmonary vessels appear crowded
- May simulate cardiomegaly or pulmonary edema

#### P - Penetration (Exposure)

**Assessment:**
- Thoracic vertebrae should be just visible through cardiac shadow
- Intervertebral disc spaces should be barely discernible

**Under-penetrated (too white):**
- Cannot see vertebrae through heart
- Lung markings appear too prominent
- May simulate interstitial disease

**Over-penetrated (too dark):**
- Vertebrae too clearly visible
- Subtle findings may be missed
- Lung markings appear diminished

#### E - Edge of Film (Coverage)

**Assessment:**
- All structures of interest should be included
- Both costophrenic angles visible
- Both lung apices visible
- Lateral chest walls included

---

## Systematic Interpretation Approach

### The ABCDEFGHI Method

Use a systematic approach EVERY TIME to avoid missing findings:

#### A - Airway

**Structures to Evaluate:**
- Trachea position (should be midline or slightly right at aortic arch)
- Tracheal width (normal: 13-25mm in men, 10-21mm in women)
- Carina (bifurcation at T4-T6 level)
- Main bronchi (right more vertical than left)

**Abnormalities:**
- Tracheal deviation (mass, tension pneumothorax, atelectasis)
- Tracheal narrowing (goiter, tumor, stenosis)
- Air bronchograms (air in bronchi visible against consolidated lung)

#### B - Bones and Soft Tissues

**Structures to Evaluate:**
- Ribs (count, contour, symmetry)
- Clavicles
- Scapulae (should be rotated out on PA)
- Humeri (visible portions)
- Spine (alignment, vertebral height)
- Soft tissues (breast shadows, chest wall)

**Abnormalities:**
- Rib fractures (acute vs. healed)
- Lytic or blastic bone lesions
- Missing ribs (prior surgery)
- Subcutaneous emphysema
- Mastectomy changes

#### C - Cardiac Silhouette

**Structures to Evaluate:**
- Cardiac size (cardiothoracic ratio)
- Cardiac contours
- Position

**Cardiothoracic Ratio (CTR):**
- Maximum cardiac width / Maximum thoracic width
- Normal: <50% on PA view
- Cannot assess on AP portable

**Right Heart Border:**
- Formed by right atrium
- Should be convex

**Left Heart Border:**
- Upper: Aortic knob
- Middle: Main pulmonary artery, left atrial appendage
- Lower: Left ventricle

**Abnormalities:**
- Cardiomegaly (CTR >50%)
- Chamber enlargement (specific contour changes)
- Pericardial effusion ("water bottle" shape)
- Calcifications

#### D - Diaphragm

**Normal Findings:**
- Right hemidiaphragm slightly higher than left (by up to 3 cm)
- Both should be smooth, dome-shaped
- Clear costophrenic angles

**Abnormalities:**
- Flattened diaphragm (hyperinflation, COPD)
- Elevated hemidiaphragm (phrenic nerve palsy, subpulmonic effusion, hepatomegaly)
- Blunted costophrenic angle (effusion, thickening)
- Free air under diaphragm (pneumoperitoneum)

#### E - Everything Else (Mediastinum)

**Mediastinal Contours:**
- Right paratracheal stripe (<4mm)
- Aortic arch (aortic knob)
- Aortopulmonary window (should be concave)
- Mediastinal width

**Hilum:**
- Left hilum slightly higher than right
- Should have concave lateral margin
- Contains pulmonary arteries, veins, bronchi, lymph nodes

**Abnormalities:**
- Mediastinal widening (lymphadenopathy, mass, aortic aneurysm)
- Hilar enlargement (lymphadenopathy, pulmonary hypertension)
- Paratracheal stripe widening (lymphadenopathy)

#### F - Fields (Lungs)

**Systematic Approach:**
- Compare side to side
- Divide each lung into zones (upper, middle, lower)
- Evaluate: aeration, lung markings, densities

**Normal Lung Markings:**
- Vascular markings visible (should taper toward periphery)
- No markings in outer 1-2 cm (vascular-free zone)
- Upper zones have fewer markings than lower (gravity effect)

**Patterns of Disease:**

| Pattern | Description | Examples |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Consolidation | Air space filled with fluid/cells | Pneumonia, hemorrhage, edema |
| Ground glass | Hazy increased density | Edema, inflammation, fibrosis |
| Nodule | Round opacity <3cm | Granuloma, cancer, metastasis |
| Mass | Round opacity >3cm | Primary lung cancer |
| Reticular | Network of lines | Interstitial lung disease |
| Reticulonodular | Lines + nodules | Sarcoidosis, lymphangitic spread |

#### G - Gastric Bubble

**Normal:**
- Air in stomach fundus visible below left hemidiaphragm
- Helps confirm upright positioning

**Abnormalities:**
- Absent (esophageal obstruction, improper positioning)
- Air-fluid level (obstruction)
- Distended (obstruction, ileus)

#### H - Hardware/Tubes/Lines

**Common Devices:**
- Endotracheal tube (tip 3-5 cm above carina)
- Central venous catheter (tip at SVC-RA junction)
- Nasogastric tube (tip in stomach, below diaphragm)
- Chest tubes (in pleural space)
- Pacemaker/ICD leads
- PICC lines

**Assessment:**

#### I - Impression

**Formulate your impression:**
- Primary findings
- Secondary findings
- Comparison with prior studies
- Recommendations if appropriate

Lower zone:    4th rib to base    |    4th rib to base
```

**Fissures:**
- **Horizontal (minor) fissure**: Separates right upper from right middle lobe; visible on PA view as horizontal line at level of 4th rib
- **Oblique (major) fissures**: Separate upper/middle from lower lobes; typically not visible on PA view

### Normal Lateral Chest X-Ray Anatomy

**Retrosternal Space:**
- Clear (black) space between sternum and heart
- Should be similar lucency to retrocardiac space

**Vertebral Bodies:**
- Should become progressively MORE lucent (darker) inferiorly
- Due to less overlying soft tissue

**Hemidiaphragms:**
- Posterior (right) hemidiaphragm is higher
- Anterior (left) hemidiaphragm is lower and partially obscured by heart

**Oblique Fissures:**
- Visible as fine lines running from posterior-superior to anterior-inferior
- Right fissure more vertical, left more horizontal

**Chest Trauma:**

| Finding | Significance |
|---------|--------------|
| Rib fractures | Assess for pneumothorax, hemothorax |
| Widened mediastinum | Aortic injury (requires CT angiography) |
| Pneumothorax | May need chest tube |
| Hemothorax | Fluid collection at base |
| Pneumomediastinum | Air tracking in mediastinum |
| Subcutaneous emphysema | Air in soft tissues |

**Shortness of Breath Differential:**

| Finding | Diagnosis |
|---------|-----------|
| Bilateral infiltrates + cardiomegaly | Pulmonary edema (CHF) |
| Lobar consolidation + fever | Pneumonia |
| Clear lungs + hyperinflation | COPD/Asthma |

| Early | Cephalization (upper lobe vessels > lower) |
| Moderate | Kerley B lines, peribronchial cuffing |
| Severe | Alveolar edema ("bat wing"), effusions |
| Treatment response | Clearing from periphery to center |

**Pneumonia Resolution:**
- Consolidation may worsen for 24-48 hours after treatment starts
- Radiographic resolution lags clinical improvement
- Complete resolution: 2-6 weeks (longer in elderly/COPD)
- Follow-up CXR at 6 weeks to confirm resolution

---

## Special Populations

### Pediatric Chest X-Ray

**Differences from Adults:**
- Thymus visible (may be large, sail sign)
- Heart appears relatively larger
- Mediastinum wider
- Less inspiration expected

**Common Pediatric Findings:**
- Bronchiolitis: Hyperinflation, peribronchial thickening
- Round pneumonia: Mass-like consolidation (common in children)
- Foreign body aspiration: Unilateral hyperinflation (air trapping)

### Pregnancy

**Considerations:**
- Shield abdomen when possible
- Radiation dose is very low, usually safe if indicated
- Physiologic changes: Slight cardiomegaly, elevated diaphragm
- Consider alternative (if not urgent): Ultrasound

### ICU/Portable Films

**Challenges:**
- AP projection (magnified heart)
- Supine positioning (fluid redistribution)
- Patient rotation common
- Limited inspiration

**Key Assessments:**
- Tube positions (ETT, NG, central lines)
- Pneumothorax (may appear as "deep sulcus sign" when supine)
- Pleural effusion (hazy opacity, especially posteriorly)
- Interval change from prior studies

---

## Comparison and Follow-up

### When to Compare

ALWAYS compare to prior studies when available. Note:
- Date of comparison study
- Interval between studies
- Any change in technique (PA vs. AP)

### What to Document

**Stable Findings:**
"Unchanged [finding] compared to [date]"

**New Findings:**
"New [finding] not present on prior [date]"

**Improved Findings:**
"Improved/resolving [finding] compared to [date]"

**Worsened Findings:**
"Worsened/progressed [finding] compared to [date]"

### Follow-up Recommendations

| Finding | Recommended Follow-up |
|---------|----------------------|
| New nodule 6-8mm | CT in 3 months |
| New nodule >8mm | CT, consider PET/biopsy |
| Pneumonia | CXR at 6 weeks to confirm resolution |
| Incidental mass | CT characterization |
| Suspected PE (normal CXR) | CT pulmonary angiography |
