## Introduction

### What is a Skeletal X-Ray?

Skeletal radiographs are plain X-ray images of bones and joints. They remain the first-line imaging modality for evaluating bone pathology, fractures, arthritis, and many musculoskeletal conditions.

### Indications

**Common Indications:**
- Trauma (suspected fracture or dislocation)
- Joint pain and swelling
- Suspected arthritis
- Evaluation of bone lesions
- Assessment of deformity
- Pre-operative planning
- Growth assessment (pediatric)
- Foreign body localization

### Fundamental Rule: Two Views

**ALWAYS obtain at least TWO views at 90 degrees to each other:**
- Fractures may only be visible on one view
- Need to assess displacement in two planes
- Standard: AP (or PA) and Lateral views
- Additional views as needed (oblique, specialized)

**"One view is no view"**

## General Principles

### How to Describe Bones

**The ABCs of Bone Interpretation:**

#### A - Alignment

**Assess:**
- Bone alignment
- Joint congruity
- Overall limb axis

**Abnormalities:**
- Angulation (measured in degrees)
- Displacement (measured in percentage or millimeters)
- Dislocation or subluxation

#### B - Bone

**Density:**
- Osteopenia (decreased density)
- Osteoporosis (severe density loss)
- Sclerosis (increased density)

**Texture:**
- Normal trabecular pattern
- Lytic lesions (holes/destruction)
- Blastic lesions (increased density)
- Mixed pattern

**Contour:**
- Cortical integrity
- Periosteal reaction
- Erosions

#### C - Cartilage (Joint Space)

**Assess:**
- Joint space width (should be uniform)
- Joint space narrowing (arthritis)
- Widening (effusion, ligament injury)

#### S - Soft Tissues

**Evaluate:**
- Soft tissue swelling
- Effusion (fat pad displacement)
- Calcifications
- Foreign bodies
- Gas (infection, trauma)

### Describing Fractures

**Complete Fracture Description:**

1. **Location:**
   - Which bone
   - Which part (epiphysis, metaphysis, diaphysis)
   - Proximal, middle, or distal third

2. **Pattern:**
   - Transverse (perpendicular to long axis)
   - Oblique (angled)
   - Spiral (twisted)
   - Comminuted (>2 fragments)
   - Segmental (isolated segment)
   - Avulsion (bone pulled off by tendon/ligament)

3. **Displacement:**
   - Percentage of cortical width
   - Direction (anterior, posterior, medial, lateral)

4. **Angulation:**
   - Degrees
   - Direction (describe apex of angle)

5. **Shortening:**
   - Overriding (overlap of fragments)
   - Measured in millimeters

6. **Open vs. Closed:**
   - Open: Skin broken (gas visible, clinical)
   - Closed: Skin intact

7. **Involvement:**
   - Intra-articular vs. extra-articular
   - Physeal involvement (pediatric)

**Example Description:**
"Transverse fracture through the mid-diaphysis of the left femur with 50% lateral displacement, 15 degrees of apex-lateral angulation, and approximately 2 cm of shortening."
