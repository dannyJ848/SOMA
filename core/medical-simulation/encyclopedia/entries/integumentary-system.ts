  summary: 'The largest organ system of the body, consisting of the skin and its accessory structures (hair, nails, glands), providing protection, sensation, thermoregulation, and vitamin D synthesis.',
  overview: {
    patient: 'Your integumentary system is your body\'s largest organ system, consisting of your skin, hair, nails, and various glands. The skin alone covers about 16% of your body weight and spans 1.5 to 2 square meters in adults. This remarkable system protects you from germs, chemicals, and the sun; helps regulate your body temperature; allows you to feel touch, heat, and pain; and even produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. Your skin constantly renews itself, with the outer layer completely replacing itself about every four weeks.',
    intermediate: 'The integumentary system comprises the skin (cutaneous membrane) and its accessory structures: hair, nails, and exocrine glands (sweat and sebaceous). The skin is a dynamic organ with multiple functions: physical barrier against pathogens and environmental insults, prevention of water loss, thermoregulation through sweating and blood flow modulation, sensory reception via specialized nerve endings, and vitamin D synthesis. The skin consists of two principal tissues: the epidermis (keratinized stratified squamous epithelium) and the dermis (dense irregular connective tissue). A subcutaneous layer (hypodermis) connects the skin to underlying structures. The system develops from embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm.',
    professional: 'The integumentary system (systema integumentarium) represents the body\'s largest organ system, constituting approximately 16% of total body mass and covering 1.5-2.0 m² in adults. It comprises the cutaneous membrane (skin proper) and accessory structures (pili, ungues, glandulae cutis). The skin exhibits complex regional variation in thickness (0.5-4.0 mm) and serves multiple homeostatic functions: barrier protection (mechanical, chemical, microbial, UV), fluid/electrolyte balance, thermoregulation (vasomotor control, sudation), cutaneous sensation (mechanoreception, thermoreception, nociception), metabolic functions (vitamin D₃ synthesis, lipid storage), and immunosurveillance (Langerhans cells). Histologically, the skin comprises two embryologically distinct tissues: epidermis (surface ectoderm-derived keratinized stratified squamous epithelium) and dermis (mesoderm-derived dense irregular connective tissue). The hypodermis (tela subcutanea), while not technically skin, anchors the integument to deep fascia and contains adipose tissue for energy storage, insulation, and cushioning.',

      title: 'Skin Layers Overview',
      content: {
        patient: `The skin has three main layers that work together to protect and maintain your body. The epidermis is the thin outer layer you can see - it's like your body's protective wrapper. The dermis is the thicker middle layer containing blood vessels, nerves, and the roots of hairs. The hypodermis (or subcutaneous layer) is the deepest layer made mainly of fat and connective tissue that connects skin to muscles and bones while providing insulation and cushioning.`,
        intermediate: `The skin consists of two principal layers with an associated subcutaneous layer. The epidermis is the superficial, avascular layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (0.1-0.2 mm thick, up to 1.5 mm on palms/soles). It provides the primary barrier function and is constantly renewed from basal stem cells. The dermis (1-2 mm thick) is vascularized connective tissue containing collagen and elastic fibers, housing the epidermal appendages (hair follicles, glands) and providing structural integrity and elasticity. The hypodermis (subcutis) is not technically part of the skin but closely associated - it consists of loose areolar connective tissue and adipose tissue, connecting skin to underlying fascia while serving insulation, energy storage, and cushioning functions.`,
        professional: `Cutaneous architecture consists of two histologically distinct tissue types forming the skin proper, plus an associated subcutaneous layer:

Epidermis: Keratinized stratified squamous epithelium (squamous keratinizing epithelium) derived from embryonic surface ectoderm. Thickness varies regionally (thin skin: ~0.1 mm, thick skin: 0.6-1.5 mm on volar surfaces). Avascular - receives nutrients by diffusion from dermal vessels. Cellular composition: keratinocytes (majority), melanocytes, Langerhans cells, Merkel cells. Proliferation confined to stratum basale; turnover time ~40-56 days for complete epidermal renewal.

Dermis (corium): Dense irregular connective tissue derived from mesoderm. Thickness 1-4 mm, contains type I and III collagen fibers (providing tensile strength), elastic fibers (providing elasticity), extrafibrillar matrix (ground substance), vascular networks, lymphatics, nerve fibers, and epithelial appendages. Divided into papillary layer (superficial, loose areolar CT with dermal papillae) and reticular layer (deep, dense irregular CT).

Hypodermis (tela subcutanea, subcutis, superficial fascia): Areolar and adipose connective tissue connecting dermis to deep fascia. Contains superficial fascia, neurovascular bundles, and variable adipose tissue (panniculus adiposus). Adipose distribution varies by sex, age, and nutritional status; serves metabolic (energy reserve), thermal (insulation), mechanical (cushioning/shock absorption), and contour functions.`,

    {
      title: 'Epidermal Structure and Cell Types',
      content: {
        patient: `The epidermis is your skin's outer protective layer. It has four or five sublayers, depending on the body location. Thick skin on your palms and soles has five layers, while thin skin covering the rest of your body has four. The deepest layer, called the stratum basale, constantly produces new skin cells that push upward. As cells move up, they fill with keratin (a tough protein), flatten out, and eventually die, forming the tough outer stratum corneum that protects you. This process takes about four weeks from start to finish.`,
        intermediate: `The epidermis is keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with four/five distinct strata. In thin skin (most of body): stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum corneum. In thick skin (palms, soles): stratum lucidum is present between granulosum and corneum.

Keratinocyte life cycle: Basal cells (stratum basale) undergo mitosis → daughter cells pushed superficially → differentiate and accumulate keratin → undergo programmed cell death (cornification) → form stratum corneum (dead, anucleated cells) → shed (desquamation). Transit time: approximately 40-56 days.

Epidermal cell types:
- Keratinocytes (90-95%): Produce keratin; form waterproof barrier
- Melanocytes (2-3%): Neural crest-derived; produce melanin in melanosomes; transfer to keratinocytes; determine skin color; UV protection
- Langerhans cells (3-5%): Dendritic antigen-presenting cells (APCs); epidermal immune surveillance
- Merkel cells (rare): Touch receptors in stratum basale; associated with sensory nerve endings (Merkel disc)`,
        professional: `Epidermal stratification and cytology:

Stratum basale (stratum germinativum): Single layer of cuboidal/columnar basal cells on basement membrane (lamina lucida and lamina densa). Contains stem cells and transient amplifying cells undergoing mitosis. Cell adhesion via hemidesmosomes (to basement membrane) and desmosomes (intercellular). Merkel cells present as clear cells with dense-core granules; express cytokeratin 20; form Merkel cell-neurite complexes with Aβ afferents.

Stratum spinosum: 8-10 cell layers polyhedral keratinocytes with prominent desmosomes (appear "spiny" after histological processing). Cytokeratin synthesis (CK1, CK10 in differentiation). Lamellar granules (Odland bodies, membrane-coating granules) first appear - contain glycolipids and hydrolytic enzymes. Langerhans cells reside here (dendritic, Birbeck granules, CD1a+, MHC class II+, epidermal APCs for contact hypersensitivity).

Stratum granulosum: 3-5 cell layers; keratohyalin granules (profilaggrin precursor) and lamellar granules prominent. Cells flatten; nuclei show chromatolysis (prekaryolysis). Lamellar granules discharge glycolipids (glycosylceramides) to intercellular space - critical barrier function.

Stratum lucidum: 2-3 cell layers; present only in thick skin (volar surfaces). Clear, translucent layer; eleidin (derived from keratohyalin); cells dead but retain outlines.

Stratum corneum: 15-30 cell layers (thick skin) or fewer (thin skin); cornified/corrified layer. Dead, anucleated keratinocytes (corneocytes) filled with keratin filaments embedded in filaggrin matrix. "Brick and mortar" organization: corneocytes (bricks) connected by corneodesmosomes; intercellular lipid lamellae (mortar) from lamellar granule contents. Desquamation: enzymatic degradation of corneodesmosomes releasing corneocytes. Permeability barrier; mechanical protection; antimicrobial peptide reservoir.

Melanocytes: Neural crest-derived; dendritic; located in basal layer. Synthesize melanin from tyrosine via tyrosinase in melanosomes (stages I-IV). Two melanin types: eumelanin (brown/black, photoprotective) and pheomelanin (red/yellow). Melanosomes transferred to keratinocytes via cytocrine secretion. Skin color determined by melanin amount/type, not melanocyte number. UV exposure stimulates melanogenesis via keratinocyte-derived signaling (α-MSH, ACTH, cytokines).`,

      title: 'Dermal Structure and Components',
      content: {
        patient: `The dermis is the thick, sturdy middle layer of your skin that gives it strength and elasticity. It contains two sublayers. The papillary layer is the thin top part with finger-like projections (dermal papillae) that interlock with the epidermis, creating your fingerprints. The deeper reticular layer is much thicker and contains strong collagen fibers that resist tearing and elastic fibers that let skin stretch and bounce back. The dermis houses blood vessels that nourish the skin, nerve endings for sensation, hair follicles, and sweat glands.`,
        intermediate: `The dermis is dense irregular connective tissue divided into two regions:

Papillary layer: Superficial 20% of dermis; loose areolar connective tissue. Contains dermal papillae - interdigitating projections into epidermis increasing surface area for nutrient exchange and mechanical attachment. Contains capillary loops, lymphatics, free nerve endings, and tactile Meissner corpuscles. Dermal papillae contain mechanoreceptors; in thick skin, arranged in parallel ridges creating fingerprints (dermatoglyphics).

Reticular layer: Deep 80% of dermis; dense irregular connective tissue. Collagen fibers (type I predominant, some type III) provide tensile strength; arranged in multidirectional bundles resisting mechanical stress from various directions. Elastic fibers provide elasticity and resilience; allow skin to return to shape after stretching. Fibroblasts produce collagen, elastin, and ground substance. Rich vascular network (superficial and deep plexuses), lymphatics, nerve fibers, and cutaneous appendages (hair follicles, glands). Lines of cleavage (Langer lines) follow collagen fiber orientation; important for surgical incision planning to minimize scarring.

Cellular components: Fibroblasts (synthesize collagen, elastin, ground substance), macrophages, mast cells (inflammatory mediators), plasma cells, adipocytes (variable).`,
        professional: `Dermal anatomy and histology:

Papillary dermis: Thin, superficial portion (approximately 1/5 dermal thickness) of loose areolar connective tissue. Richly vascularized with superficial vascular plexus. Dermal papillae (papillae dermis): cone-shaped projections interdigitating with epidermal rete ridges; increase dermo-epidermal junction surface area 10-fold. Contain capillary loops (nutrient supply to avascular epidermis), Meissner corpuscles (tactile mechanoreceptors, especially in glabrous skin), and free nerve endings. Papillary loops arranged in parallel ridges in thick skin forming friction ridges (dermatoglyphics) responsible for fingerprints.

Reticular dermis: Thick, deep portion (approximately 4/5 dermal thickness) of dense irregular connective tissue. Predominantly type I collagen (80% dry weight) arranged in interwoven bundles oriented in multiple directions providing multidirectional tensile strength. Type III collagen (reticulin) surrounds vessels and nerves. Elastic fibers (elastin + fibrillin microfibrils) provide elasticity; arranged parallel to collagen but distinct. Ground substance: glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronic acid, dermatan sulfate), proteoglycans, glycoproteins (fibronectin, laminin). Cell types: fibroblasts (synthesize and remodel matrix), macrophages, mast cells, dermal dendrocytes.

Vascular supply: Subpapillary plexus (superficial) and cutaneous plexus (deep) connected by communicating vessels. Arteriovenous anastomoses (glomus bodies) for thermoregulation present in fingertips. Lymphatic vessels accompany blood vessels.

Innervation: Rich sensory innervation via cutaneous nerves. Nerve fibers form plexuses at dermo-epidermal junction and around hair follicles (hair root plexus). Autonomic motor fibers to arrector pili, blood vessels, and glands.

Mechanical properties: Collagen provides tensile strength (resistance to stretching); elastic fibers provide elasticity (return to resting length). Lines of cleavage (Langer lines): direction of predominant collagen bundles; wounds parallel to lines heal with finer scars; surgical importance for elective incisions.`,

      title: 'Accessory Structures: Hair, Nails, and Glands',
      content: {
        patient: `Your skin contains several important accessory structures. Hair grows from follicles rooted in the dermis and serves protection (like eyelashes keeping dust out), warmth, and sensory functions. Hair grows in cycles: actively growing for years, then resting before falling out and being replaced. Nails are hard plates of keratin that protect fingertips and help with fine manipulation. The lunula (white half-moon at nail base) marks the growing area. Your skin has three types of glands: eccrine sweat glands (all over body, for cooling), apocrine sweat glands (armpits/genitals, active at puberty), and sebaceous glands (produce oil to lubricate skin and hair).`,
        intermediate: `Accessory structures (appendages) develop from embryonic epidermis and extend into dermis/hypodermis:

Hair (pili): Filamentous keratinized structures. Components: shaft (exposed portion), root (embedded in skin), bulb (expanded base with matrix). Hair follicle: epithelial sheath (internal/external root sheaths) + connective tissue sheath. Hair papilla: vascularized connective tissue at base supplying matrix. Hair structure: medulla (core, variable), cortex (bulk, keratinized cells), cuticle (outer protective layer). Hair color from melanin (eumelanin = brown/black; pheomelanin = red). Arrector pili muscle (smooth muscle) attaches to follicle; contraction causes "goosebumps" and extrudes sebum. Functions: protection (mechanical, UV), thermoregulation, sensory (hair root plexus). Growth cycle: anagen (growth, 2-7 years), catagen (transition, 2-3 weeks), telogen (resting, 2-4 months); 50-100 hairs shed daily.

Nails (ungues): Keratinized plates on dorsal digit tips. Parts: nail plate, free edge, nail root/matrix (growth area), nail bed, eponychium (cuticle), hyponychium (under free edge), lunula (visible portion of matrix). Growth rate: fingernails 3-4 mm/month, toenails slower.

Eccrine sweat glands: Merocrine glands throughout skin; highest density palms/soles/forehead. Simple coiled tubular glands; duct opens directly to skin surface. Secrete hypotonic sweat (99% water, NaCl, urea, ammonia, antimicrobial peptides like dermcidin). Thermoregulatory function.

Apocrine sweat glands: Larger; associated with hair follicles in axillary, anogenital regions. Become active at puberty. Secrete viscous milky fluid containing proteins, lipids; bacterial decomposition produces characteristic odor. Stress/emotional sweating.

Sebaceous glands: Holocrine glands associated with hair follicles (pilosebaceous unit). Secrete sebum (triglycerides, wax esters, cholesterol, squalene) onto hair shaft and skin surface. Lubricates hair and skin; antimicrobial fatty acids; prevents water loss. Stimulated by androgens; active in puberty.`,
        professional: `Cutaneous appendages - detailed structure:

Hair follicle: Epidermal invagination extending into dermis/hypodermis. Embryonic origin: ectodermal placode and mesenchymal condensation. Structure: Connective tissue root sheath (derived from dermis, equivalent to papillary dermis) contains papilla. Epithelial root sheath: external (continuous with epidermis) and internal (produced by matrix, forms companion layer). Glassy membrane (thickened basement membrane zone between sheaths). Hair bulb: contains matrix (proliferative epithelial cells equivalent to stratum basale). Dermal papilla: specialized mesenchyme with capillary loops and nerve endings; inductive signals regulate hair cycling.

Hair fiber structure: Medulla (air-containing cells, absent in vellus/fine hair), cortex (elongated keratinized cells with hard keratin, contains melanin granules), cuticle (overlapping keratinized scales like shingles). Hard keratin (hair/nail) vs soft keratin (epidermis). Hair types: terminal (scalp - anagen 2-7 years, growth rate 0.3 mm/day), vellus (fine, short), lanugo (fetal).

Hair cycling: Anagen (active growth, matrix proliferation, 85-90% scalp hairs), catagen (regression, apoptosis-driven follicle shortening, 2% of hairs), telogen (resting, 10-15% of hairs). Cycling controlled by papilla-derived signals, hormones, growth factors. Miniaturization in androgenetic alopecia.

Nail unit: Nail matrix (proximal, produces dorsal plate; distal, produces ventral plate). Nail plate: hard keratin, translucent (appears pink from underlying vascular bed). Lunula: visible distal matrix (thicker epithelium obscures vasculature). Eponychium (cuticle): protective seal. Hyponychium: thickened stratum corneum under free edge. Nail growth: matrix proliferation rate ~0.1 mm/day (fingernails faster than toenails; faster in youth, summer, dominant hand). Onychodermal band (solehorn) seals nail bed to plate.

Sudoriferous glands: 
Eccrine (merocrine): 2-5 million; simple coiled tubular; secretory coil in deep dermis/hypodermis, duct through dermis/epidermis (acrosyringium). Secretory epithelium: clear cells (glycogen-rich, water secretion), dark cells (glycoprotein secretion), myoepithelial cells (contractile). Duct: stratified cuboidal epithelium reabsorbs NaCl (making final sweat hypotonic). Cholinergic sympathetic innervation; thermoregulatory center in hypothalamus. Capacity: 10-14 L/day maximum.

Apocrine: Limited distribution (axilla, anogenital, areola, eyelid-Moll's glands); larger than eccrine; duct empties into hair follicle above sebaceous duct. Secretion viscous, protein-rich, odorless; bacterial decomposition (Corynebacterium) produces odor. Adrenergic sympathetic innervation; activated by emotional stress; androgen-dependent development.

Sebaceous glands: Holocrine secretion (whole cell disintegrates); acinar structure; associated with hair follicles forming pilosebaceous unit (except eyelids, buccal mucosa, areola, labia minora where free). Sebum composition: triglycerides (~40%), wax esters (~25%), squalene (~12%), cholesterol/esters (~10%). Functions: emollient, waterproofing, antibacterial (free fatty acids), pheromone dispersion. Sebaceous gland activity regulated by androgens; increased activity in puberty; sebaceous hyperplasia with aging.`,

      title: 'Skin Functions and Wound Healing',
      content: {
        patient: `Your skin performs many vital functions beyond just covering your body. Protection is its main job - the keratinized outer layer blocks germs, chemicals, and UV radiation while preventing water loss. Your skin is also your largest sensory organ, packed with receptors for touch, pressure, temperature, and pain. It helps regulate body temperature through sweating and blood vessel changes - vessels widen to release heat and narrow to conserve it. Skin produces vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, essential for bone health. When injured, skin repairs itself through inflammation (cleaning the wound), new tissue formation, and remodeling to restore the barrier.`,
        intermediate: `The integumentary system performs essential homeostatic functions:

Protection: Physical barrier against mechanical trauma, chemicals, and microorganisms. Stratum corneum prevents water loss (transepidermal water loss, TEWL) and blocks UV radiation. Melanin absorbs UV protecting DNA. Acid mantle (pH 4.5-5.5 from sebum, sweat, bacterial byproducts) inhibits microbial growth. Antimicrobial peptides (defensins, cathelicidins) provide innate immunity.

Sensation: Rich sensory innervation detects touch (mechanoreceptors), temperature (thermoreceptors), and pain (nociceptors). Specialized receptors: Meissner corpuscles (light touch, rapid adaptation), Merkel discs (sustained touch, pressure), Pacinian corpuscles (vibration, deep pressure), Ruffini endings (stretch), Krause end bulbs (cold), free nerve endings (pain, heat, cold). Hair root plexus detects hair displacement.

Thermoregulation: Eccrine sweat secretion (evaporative cooling) can dissipate 600 kcal/hour at maximum. Cutaneous vasodilation (up to 6 L/min blood flow) dissipates heat; vasoconstriction conserves heat. Arteriovenous anastomoses (glomus bodies) shunt blood. Behavioral responses (seeking shade/warmth).

Metabolic functions: Vitamin D₃ synthesis (7-dehydrocholesterol → cholecalciferol under UVB 290-315 nm); subsequent liver/kidney hydroxylation produces active calcitriol for calcium absorption. Lipid storage (hypodermis); triglyceride reserve.

Immunological function: Langerhans cells present antigens; keratinocytes produce cytokines; complement activation.

Wound healing phases: Hemostasis/inflammation (platelet plug, vasoconstriction, neutrophils/macrophages), proliferation (granulation tissue formation, angiogenesis, epithelialization, collagen synthesis by fibroblasts), and remodeling (collagen reorganization, wound contraction, scar maturation). Healing by primary intention (sutured) vs secondary intention (open).`,
        professional: `Integumentary system functions - detailed physiology:

Barrier functions: 
- Mechanical: Stratum corneum resists abrasion; collagen provides tensile strength; subcutaneous fat cushions impact.
- Chemical: Stratum corneum lipids resist hydrophilic/hydrophobic substances; pH 4.5-5.5 acid mantle from sebum fatty acids, sweat lactic acid/urea, microbial metabolites.
- Biological: Stratum corneum sloughing removes colonizing microbes; antimicrobial peptides (human β-defensins 1-4, cathelicidin LL-37, psoriasin); normal flora competition; Langerhans cell immune surveillance.
- Photoprotection: Melanin absorbs/scatters UVB (280-315 nm) and UVA (315-400 nm); nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced DNA damage; stratum corneum scattering/reflecting.

Sensory physiology: Cutaneous sensory receptors classified by modality and adaptation rate. Aβ fibers: Merkel discs (SA-I, sustained pressure), Meissner corpuscles (RA-I, rapid adaptation, 2-50 Hz vibration), Pacinian corpuscles (RA-II/Pacinian, 200-300 Hz vibration, deep pressure), Ruffini endings (SA-II, skin stretch). Aδ fibers: free nerve endings (nociceptors - mechanical, thermal, chemical; cold thermoreceptors). C fibers: polymodal nociceptors (heat >43°C), warm thermoreceptors. Receptive field size correlates with spatial acuity (smallest at fingertips with high Meissner density).

Thermoregulatory mechanisms: Heat dissipation: eccrine sweating (maximum rate 2-4 L/hour in heat-acclimatized individuals; cholinergic sympathetic activation via muscarinic receptors), cutaneous active vasodilation (mediated by sympathetic cholinergic cotransmission with nitric oxide, substance P, CGRP). Heat conservation/retention: sympathetic adrenergic vasoconstriction, piloerection (minimal human significance), behavioral adaptations. Thermoreceptive afferents provide feedback to hypothalamic thermoregulatory center (preoptic area).

Vitamin D synthesis: Cutaneous 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D₃) converted by UVB (290-315 nm, peak 295-297 nm) to previtamin D₃ → thermal isomerization to vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol). Transported to liver (25-hydroxylation) then kidney (1α-hydroxylation) to active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (calcitriol). Regulates calcium/phosphate absorption, bone mineralization, immune function. Excessive UV converts previtamin D₃ to inactive lumisterol/tachysterol (prevents toxicity).

Wound healing biology: 
- Hemostasis (immediate): Platelet aggregation, degranulation (PDGF, TGF-β, VEGF), fibrin clot formation; vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation.
- Inflammatory phase (0-3 days): Neutrophil infiltration (bacterial killing, debris clearance) → macrophage dominance (phagocytosis, cytokine secretion IL-1, TNF-α, TGF-β, FGF, PDGF). Inflammation necessary for healing but excessive inflammation impairs healing.
- Proliferative phase (3-21 days): Re-epithelialization (keratinocyte migration from wound edges and adnexal structures; MMP-mediated matrix degradation), angiogenesis (endothelial sprouting from vessels), fibroplasia (fibroblast migration, proliferation, collagen III synthesis), granulation tissue formation, wound contraction (myofibroblasts with α-smooth muscle actin).
- Remodeling phase (21 days-2 years): Collagen III replaced by type I, cross-linking increases tensile strength (reaches maximum 80% of unwounded strength), wound contraction completes, apoptosis of excess cells, scar maturation.

Factors affecting healing: Adequate perfusion, nutrition (protein, vitamin C for collagen, zinc for enzymes), oxygen tension, absence of infection, age (slower in elderly), comorbidities (diabetes, immunosuppression, vascular disease), medications (corticosteroids, chemotherapy), smoking.`,
