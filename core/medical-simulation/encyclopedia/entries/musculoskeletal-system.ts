  summary: 'The body system comprising bones, muscles, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and joints that provides structure, movement, and protection for the body.',
  overview: {
    patient: 'The musculoskeletal system is your body\'s framework for movement and support. It includes your bones (206 in an adult), muscles (over 600), and connecting tissues like tendons and ligaments. Your bones provide structure and protect vital organs like your brain and heart. Your muscles work with your bones to create movement, from walking to smiling. Joints connect bones together and allow different types of movement, from the hinge motion of your elbow to the ball-and-socket motion of your shoulder.',
    intermediate: 'The musculoskeletal system consists of the skeletal system (bones, cartilage, ligaments) and muscular system (skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle). The adult skeleton contains 206 bones organized into the axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, rib cage - 80 bones) and appendicular skeleton (limbs and girdles - 126 bones). Bones serve multiple functions: support, protection, movement (as levers), mineral storage (calcium, phosphorus), and blood cell production (hematopoiesis in red bone marrow). Skeletal muscles (over 600) attach to bones via tendons and work in antagonistic pairs to produce movement across synovial joints. The system also includes cartilage (hyaline, elastic, fibrocartilage) providing smooth joint surfaces and flexibility.',
    professional: 'The musculoskeletal system represents the integrated structural and functional relationship between the skeletal system (osseo-ligamentous framework) and muscular system (contractile apparatus). The skeleton comprises 206 bones: axial skeleton (80 bones including skull, auditory ossicles, hyoid, vertebral column, thoracic cage) and appendicular skeleton (126 bones including pectoral/pelvic girdles and limbs). Bone tissue types: compact (dense, cortical) and spongy (cancellous, trabecular). Histologically, bone consists of osteocytes within lacunae, organized into osteons/Haversian systems in cortical bone. Functions: biomechanical support, organ protection (cranium, thorax), leverage for movement, mineral homeostasis (99% calcium, 85% phosphorus), hematopoiesis (red marrow in flat bones, proximal epiphyses), and energy storage (yellow marrow adipocytes). Muscle tissue types: skeletal (striated, voluntary, multinucleated), cardiac (striated, involuntary, uninucleated, intercalated discs), and smooth (non-striated, involuntary, single nucleus). Skeletal muscles function through excitation-contraction coupling involving T-tubules, sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release, troponin-tropomyosin regulation, and actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling (sliding filament theory). Joints (articulations) classified structurally (fibrous, cartilaginous, synovial) and functionally (synarthrosis, amphiarthrosis, diarthrosis). Synovial joints feature articular cartilage, joint cavity, fibrous articular capsule, synovial membrane, and reinforcing ligaments.',

      content: {
        patient: `Bones are living tissues that come in different shapes depending on their job. Long bones like your arms and legs are shaped like rods and are longer than they are wide. Short bones like those in your wrists and ankles are cube-shaped. Flat bones like your ribs and skull bones are thin and provide protection. Irregular bones like your vertebrae have complex shapes that don't fit other categories. Inside, bones have two types of tissue: hard, dense compact bone on the outside that gives strength, and spongy bone on the inside that looks like a honeycomb and is lighter but still strong.`,
        intermediate: `Bones are classified by shape into four categories. Long bones have a shaft (diaphysis) and two ends (epiphyses), are longer than wide, and include the femur, humerus, and phalanges. They contain yellow marrow (adipose) in the medullary cavity and red marrow in epiphyses. Short bones are roughly cube-shaped (length ≈ width), include carpals and tarsals, and contain mostly spongy bone with a thin cortical shell. Flat bones are thin, flattened, and often curved, including cranial bones, sternum, ribs, and scapulae; they have two layers of compact bone sandwiching spongy bone (diploe). Irregular bones have complex shapes that don't fit other categories, including vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, temporal bone, ethmoid, sphenoid, mandible, and maxilla. Sesamoid bones develop within tendons (patella is largest) to reduce friction and alter tendon pull direction. Bone tissue consists of compact bone (dense, forms outer layer, organized in osteons) and spongy bone (trabecular, latticework of bone spicules/trabeculae, red marrow-filled spaces).`,
        professional: `Bone classification by shape and structure:

Long bones: Characterized by diaphysis (shaft - tubular, cortical bone, medullary cavity with yellow marrow, nutrient foramina) and epiphyses (ends - spongy bone with red marrow, articular cartilage covering). Examples: femur, tibia, fibula, humerus, radius, ulna, metacarpals, metatarsals, phalanges. Epiphyseal plate (growth plate) in children is hyaline cartilage; epiphyseal line in adults is remnant after fusion.

Short bones: Cuboidal shape, provide stability with limited motion. Structure: spongy bone core with thin compact bone shell. Examples: carpal bones (scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, pisiform, trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, hamate), tarsal bones (calcaneus, talus, navicular, cuboid, cuneiforms - 3). Function: shock absorption, gliding movements.

Flat bones: Thin, flattened, often curved. Structure: two parallel plates of compact bone (tables) with spongy bone between (diploe in skull). Examples: frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid (cranial), mandible, maxilla, palatine, zygomatic (facial), sternum, ribs, scapulae. Functions: protection (brain, heart, pelvic viscera), extensive muscle attachment surface.

Irregular bones: Complex shapes not fitting other categories. Examples: vertebrae (body, vertebral arch, processes), sacrum (fused S1-S5), coccyx (3-4 fused vertebrae), hyoid, temporal, sphenoid, ethmoid. Features often include sinuses, foramina, complex articular surfaces.

Sesamoid bones: Develop within tendons, typically near joints. Patella (largest sesamoid) in quadriceps tendon. Pisiform (sesamoid in flexor carpi ulnaris tendon). Function: protect tendons from compression, improve mechanical advantage by increasing distance from joint axis.

Bone tissue architecture: Compact bone - osteons (Haversian systems) arranged parallel to long axis for strength. Each osteon: central Haversian canal (blood vessels, nerves), concentric lamellae (calcified matrix with collagen fibers), osteocytes in lacunae connected by canaliculi (nutrient/waste exchange). Circumferential lamellae (outer/inner surfaces). Interstitial lamellae (remnants of remodeled osteons). Perforating/Volkmann's canals connect osteons transversely. Spongy bone - trabeculae arranged along stress lines (Wolff's law), no osteons, trabeculae contain lamellae with osteocytes, marrow-filled spaces between trabeculae.`,

      title: 'Bone Cells and Matrix',
      content: {
        patient: `Bones are living tissue made of cells and a hard matrix. The matrix contains collagen (a protein for flexibility) and calcium phosphate (minerals for hardness). Four types of cells work together to maintain bone: osteoblasts build new bone, osteocytes are mature bone cells that maintain tissue, osteoclasts break down old bone, and osteogenic cells are stem cells that become osteoblasts. This balance between building and breaking down allows bones to grow, heal, and adapt throughout life.`,
        intermediate: `Bone tissue is composed of cells and extracellular matrix. The organic matrix (35% dry weight) contains type I collagen fibers (provides tensile strength, flexibility) and ground substance (proteoglycans, glycoproteins like osteocalcin and osteonectin). The inorganic matrix (65% dry weight) is hydroxyapatite crystals - calcium phosphate [Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂] with calcium carbonate and other ions, providing compressive strength. Four cell types: Osteogenic (osteoprogenitor) cells - stem cells in periosteum and endosteum that differentiate into osteoblasts. Osteoblasts - bone-forming cells derived from mesenchymal stem cells; synthesize collagen and matrix proteins; express alkaline phosphatase; become trapped in matrix as osteocytes. Osteocytes - mature bone cells residing in lacunae; maintain bone matrix; communicate via canaliculi; act as mechanosensors detecting mechanical stress. Osteoclasts - large multinucleated cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells (monocyte/macrophage lineage); function in bone resorption via ruffled border secreting HCl (dissolves minerals) and cathepsin K (digests collagen); regulated by RANKL and OPG.`,
        professional: `Bone cell biology and matrix composition:

Matrix composition: Organic (35% of dry weight) - Type I collagen (90-95% of organic matrix) arranged in cross-linked fibrils with quarter-stagger pattern providing tensile strength; ground substance (5-10%) includes proteoglycans (aggrecan, decorin, biglycan), glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin sulfate, keratan sulfate), glycoproteins (osteocalcin, osteonectin/SPARC, bone sialoprotein, fibronectin, thrombospondin). Inorganic (65% dry weight) - Hydroxyapatite [Ca₁₀(PO₄)₆(OH)₂] nanocrystals (20-80 nm) deposited in gap zones of collagen fibrils; also contains carbonate (substitutes for phosphate), citrate, magnesium, sodium, potassium, fluoride, strontium. Mineralization process: matrix vesicles bud from osteoblasts, concentrate calcium/phosphate, initiate hydroxyapatite crystal formation; crystals grow and spread along collagen fibrils.

Osteogenic (osteoprogenitor) cells: Mesenchymal stem cells located in deep periosteal layers and endosteum. Express markers: STRO-1, CD105, CD90, CD73. Differentiation regulated by transcription factors (Runx2, Osterix/Osx), growth factors (BMPs, TGF-β, FGFs, IGFs), Wnt signaling. Can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, myocytes.

Osteoblasts: Cuboidal cells on bone surfaces; derived from mesenchymal stem cells via Runx2/Osx commitment. Functions: synthesize type I collagen (procollagen → collagen), non-collagenous proteins, alkaline phosphatase (marker, involved in mineralization). Receptors: PTH/PTHrP, vitamin D, estrogen, glucocorticoid. Fate: become osteocytes (embedded in matrix), bone lining cells (quiescent on surface), or undergo apoptosis. Marker genes: COL1A1, ALPL, BGLAP (osteocalcin), SP7 (Osterix).

Osteocytes: Mature bone cells (20,000-30,000 per mm³); most abundant bone cell type. Reside in lacunae; processes extend through canaliculi (100-400 per cell) forming gap junctions with neighboring cells. Functions: mechanosensation (detect fluid shear stress from loading), regulate mineral homeostasis (sclerostin, DMP1, FGF23), coordinate remodeling via RANKL expression. Lacuno-canalicular network allows nutrient/waste exchange and cell signaling.

Osteoclasts: Large multinucleated giant cells (10-20 nuclei, 100 μm diameter). Derived from hematopoietic CFU-GM → monocytes → fusion into osteoclasts. Differentiation requires M-CSF and RANKL (expressed by osteoblasts/stromal cells). Structure: ruffled border (sealed zone facing bone), clear zone (actin ring for sealing), basolateral membrane. Mechanism: carbonic anhydrase II produces H⁺; H⁺-ATPase pumps H⁺ into resorption lacuna (pH ~4.5); cathepsin K digests collagen; matrix metalloproteinases degrade non-collagenous proteins. Regulation: stimulated by PTH, 1,25(OH)₂D₃, cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α); inhibited by calcitonin, estrogen, OPG (decoy receptor for RANKL), bisphosphonates.

Bone membranes: Periosteum - outer fibrous layer (dense connective tissue, Sharpey's fibers penetrate bone) and inner cambium layer (osteogenic cells). Endosteum - cellular lining of medullary cavity and trabecular surfaces (osteoprogenitor cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts).`,

      title: 'Bone Formation and Remodeling',
      content: {
        patient: `Bones form through two processes. Intramembranous ossification builds flat bones like your skull: connective tissue becomes bone directly. Endochondral ossification builds long bones: a cartilage model forms first, then turns into bone. Bone is constantly remodeling throughout life - old bone is broken down by osteoclasts and new bone is built by osteoblasts. This process allows bones to heal, adapt to stress, and maintain calcium levels. Peak bone mass is reached in your 20s, then gradual bone loss occurs with aging.`,
        intermediate: `Ossification (osteogenesis) occurs by two mechanisms. Intramembranous ossification forms flat bones (skull, clavicles): mesenchymal cells cluster and differentiate directly into osteoblasts forming bone spicules that fuse into trabecular bone, then compact bone develops peripherally. Endochondral ossification forms most bones (long bones, vertebrae, ribs, base of skull): hyaline cartilage model forms first; primary ossification center develops in diaphysis (chondrocytes hypertrophy, die, matrix calcifies; blood vessels invade bringing osteoprogenitor cells that become osteoblasts); secondary ossification centers form in epiphyses postnatally; epiphyseal plates (growth plates) remain between diaphysis and epiphyses until puberty. Bone remodeling is lifelong process replacing about 10% of skeleton annually. Basic multicellular unit (BMU): activation (cytokine signaling), resorption (osteoclasts create Howship's lacunae, 2-4 weeks), reversal (mononuclear cells prepare surface), formation (osteoblasts lay down new matrix in layers/lamellae, 3-4 months), mineralization (calcium deposition), quiescence. Remodeling responds to mechanical stress (Wolff's law: bone adapts to imposed demands) and metabolic needs.`,
        professional: `Ossification mechanisms and remodeling physiology:

Intramembranous ossification: Mesenchymal stem cells aggregate at ossification centers → differentiate into osteoblasts without cartilage intermediate. Process: (1) Mesenchymal condensation with increased vascularity; (2) Differentiation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts at primary ossification centers; (3) Osteoid secretion and mineralization forming bone spicules; (4) Trabeculae fuse forming woven bone then lamellar bone; (5) Periosteum forms superficially; (6) Compact bone develops on surfaces via appositional growth. Occurs in: frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, sphenoid bones; mandible; maxilla; clavicles (medial 2/3).

Endochondral ossification: Cartilage model serves as template replaced by bone. Stages: (1) Mesenchymal cells condense and differentiate into chondroblasts forming hyaline cartilage model (week 6-8 embryonic); (2) Perichondrium surrounding diaphysis becomes periosteum; osteoblasts in cambium layer form bone collar around diaphysis; (3) Chondrocytes in center hypertrophy, secrete alkaline phosphatase, matrix calcifies; chondrocytes die creating cavities; (4) Periosteal bud (blood vessels, nerves, red marrow, osteoprogenitor cells) invades cavities; osteoblasts form primary spongiosa; (5) Osteoclasts remodel forming medullary cavity; diaphysis ossifies (primary ossification center); (6) Secondary ossification centers form in epiphyses (birth to several years postnatal); (7) Epiphyseal plates persist between diaphysis and epiphyses allowing longitudinal growth; zones: reserve cartilage, proliferative (cell columns), hypertrophic (matrix calcification), calcified cartilage, ossification. Epiphyseal plate closure: hormonal (estrogen critical for closure in both sexes), occurs late adolescence/early adulthood (earlier in females).

Bone remodeling cycle: Coupled process of bone resorption and formation maintaining skeletal integrity and calcium homeostasis. Activation: osteocytes detect microdamage or hormonal signals; RANKL expression; lining cells retract exposing mineralized matrix. Resorption: osteoclasts bind RANKL via RANK; fuse and polarize; form sealed compartment; secrete HCl and proteases; create resorption lacuna (Howship's lacuna) 40-60 μm deep; completed in 2-4 weeks. Reversal: osteoclasts undergo apoptosis; mononuclear cells prepare cement line; growth factors released from matrix (TGF-β, IGFs, BMPs). Formation: osteoblast precursors recruited; differentiate; form osteoid (unmineralized matrix) in layers (lamellae); process takes 3-4 months covering resorption cavity. Mineralization: calcium phosphate deposition; takes weeks to months; mineralization lag time ~10 days. Quiescence: osteoblasts become bone lining cells or osteocytes; surface rests until next cycle. Remodeling rate: 3-4 million BMUs active at any time; 10% of skeleton replaced annually; trabecular bone turns over faster (25%/year) than cortical bone (3%/year).

Regulation of remodeling: Mechanical loading (Wolff's law) - strain stimulates osteocyte signaling (↑osteoblast activity, ↓osteoclast activity). Disuse causes bone loss (paralysis, space flight). Hormonal: PTH (intermittent = anabolic, continuous = catabolic), calcitonin (inhibits resorption), vitamin D (promotes mineralization), estrogen (inhibits resorption, maintains bone mass; deficiency causes osteoporosis), testosterone (anabolic), thyroid hormone (increases turnover), glucocorticoids (excess causes osteoporosis), growth hormone/IGF-1 (anabolic). Local factors: cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α stimulate resorption), prostaglandins, nitric oxide. Peak bone mass: attained third decade (genetics 60-80%, nutrition, exercise, hormones). After age 40: gradual bone loss (0.3-0.5%/year in males, 2-3%/year postmenopausal in females).`,

      title: 'Muscle Tissue Types',
      content: {
        patient: `Your body has three types of muscle tissue. Skeletal muscle attaches to bones and enables voluntary movement like walking and smiling - you control these muscles consciously. Cardiac muscle makes up your heart and pumps blood automatically - you don't control it. Smooth muscle is found in your digestive tract, blood vessels, and other internal organs - it works automatically to move food, control blood flow, and perform other internal functions. Each type has a special structure suited to its job.`,
        intermediate: `Muscle tissue is specialized for contraction and exists in three histological types. Skeletal muscle is striated (striped appearance under microscope), voluntary (conscious control), attached to bones via tendons, multinucleated (multiple nuclei per cell), and has peripheral nuclei located just beneath sarcolemma (muscle cell membrane). Each skeletal muscle fiber (cell) is long cylindrical (up to 30 cm), formed from fusion of myoblasts during development. Functions: body movement, posture maintenance, heat generation (shivering). Cardiac muscle is striated, involuntary, found only in heart walls (myocardium), typically uninucleated (occasionally binucleated), with central nuclei. Unique features: intercalated discs (specialized cell junctions with desmosomes and gap junctions allowing electrical coupling), branching fibers forming functional syncytium. Functions: rhythmic pumping of blood, autorhythmicity (pacemaker potential). Smooth muscle is non-striated, involuntary, found in walls of hollow organs (GI tract, blood vessels, respiratory tract, urinary tract, reproductive tract), uninucleated with central nucleus. Cells are spindle-shaped (tapered ends), arranged in sheets. Two types: single-unit (visceral) smooth muscle - cells connected by gap junctions, contract as a unit (GI tract, uterus); multi-unit smooth muscle - cells independent, individually innervated (iris, arrector pili). Functions: peristalsis, vasoconstriction/vasodilation, pupil constriction, hair erection.`,
        professional: `Muscle tissue classification and histology:

Skeletal muscle: Striated, voluntary, somatic nervous system innervation (motor neurons). Structural organization: Muscle → fascicles (perimysium) → fibers/cells (endomysium). Fiber characteristics: cylindrical, elongated (1-30 cm length, 10-100 μm diameter), multinucleated (hundreds of nuclei per fiber), peripherally located nuclei (subsarcolemmal), formed by fusion of myoblasts (syncytium) during embryonic development. Sarcolemma (plasma membrane) with invaginations forming T-tubules (transverse tubules) at A-I junctions (triad with terminal cisternae). Sarcoplasm (cytoplasm) contains myofibrils, glycogen, myoglobin. Myofibrils contain contractile proteins arranged in sarcomeres creating striations (A bands, I bands, Z discs, H zones, M lines). Connective tissue: epimysium (surrounds entire muscle), perimysium (surrounds fascicles), endomysium (surrounds individual fibers). Tendons (dense regular connective tissue) attach muscle to bone; myotendinous junction specialized interface. Motor unit: single motor neuron and all muscle fibers it innervates; small units for fine control (extraocular muscles), large units for power (quadriceps).

Cardiac muscle: Striated, involuntary, autonomic nervous system regulation. Found exclusively in myocardium (heart walls). Histological features: cells shorter and branched than skeletal muscle (50-100 μm length, 10-20 μm diameter), typically single central nucleus (occasionally binucleated), myofibrils with sarcomeres (similar banding pattern). Intercalated discs: specialized cell junctions connecting cardiac muscle cells end-to-end. Components: fascia adherens (anchoring site for actin filaments, analogous to Z disc), desmosomes (macula adherens - strong adhesion, intermediate filaments), gap junctions (nexus - low-resistance electrical coupling allowing rapid action potential spread). Functional syncytium: cells electrically coupled allowing coordinated contraction. Features: autorhythmicity (pacemaker cells in SA node generate spontaneous depolarizations), long absolute refractory period (prevents tetany), high mitochondria content (25-30% cell volume, aerobic metabolism).

Smooth muscle: Non-striated, involuntary. Widespread distribution: GI tract (muscularis externa), blood vessels (tunica media), respiratory tract (bronchi, bronchioles), urinary tract, reproductive tract, iris and ciliary body of eye, arrector pili of skin. Cell morphology: spindle-shaped (fusiform), tapering ends, 20-500 μm length, 5-10 μm diameter (thickest in middle), single central nucleus (cigar-shaped, elongated). Thick and thin filaments present but not arranged in sarcomeres (no striations); dense bodies (analogous to Z discs) anchor thin filaments; intermediate filaments provide structural support. Myosin has different light chains than skeletal muscle; phosphorylation required for activation (calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase). Types: Single-unit (unitary, visceral) smooth muscle - cells connected by gap junctions, electrically coupled, contract as a functional unit, spontaneous activity (pacemaker cells), found in GI tract, uterus, small vessels. Multi-unit smooth muscle - cells independent, no gap junctions, individually innervated by autonomic nerves, respond to hormones, precise graded control, found in iris, ciliary muscle, arrector pili, large vessels. Regulation: autonomic nervous system (sympathetic often relaxes GI, constricts vessels; parasympathetic often stimulates GI), hormones, local factors (stretch, pH, oxygen). Contraction mechanism: Ca²⁺ binds calmodulin → activates MLCK → phosphorylates myosin light chain → cross-bridge cycling → contraction; slower but more sustained than skeletal muscle (latch state for sustained contraction with minimal energy).`,

      title: 'Skeletal Muscle Structure and Contraction',
      content: {
        patient: `Skeletal muscles contract when triggered by signals from your nerves. The basic unit of contraction is the sarcomere - a tiny segment inside muscle fibers that shortens when the muscle contracts. Thin filaments (actin) slide past thick filaments (myosin) like a telescope collapsing, making the muscle shorter. Calcium and ATP (energy) are required for this process. The neuromuscular junction is where a nerve meets a muscle - when a nerve signal arrives, it releases a chemical called acetylcholine that triggers the muscle to contract.`,
        intermediate: `Skeletal muscle contraction occurs via the sliding filament mechanism within sarcomeres. Sarcomere structure: Z-discs (Z-lines) mark boundaries; thin filaments (actin plus regulatory proteins tropomyosin and troponin) attach to Z-discs and extend toward center; thick filaments (myosin) are centered in A-band; M-line marks center of sarcomere; I-band contains only thin filaments; H-zone contains only thick filaments. Contraction cycle: (1) Nerve action potential arrives at neuromuscular junction; (2) Acetylcholine released into synaptic cleft binds nicotinic receptors on muscle membrane; (3) End-plate potential triggers muscle action potential spreading along sarcolemma and down T-tubules; (4) Dihydropyridine receptors in T-tubule membrane sense voltage change; (5) DHPRs interact with ryanodine receptors on sarcoplasmic reticulum triggering Ca²⁺ release; (6) Ca²⁺ binds troponin C causing conformational change; (7) Tropomyosin moves exposing myosin-binding sites on actin; (8) Myosin heads (in energized state with bound ADP+Pi) bind actin forming cross-bridges; (9) Power stroke: myosin head pivots pulling thin filament toward M-line; (10) ADP and Pi released; (11) New ATP binds causing myosin detachment; (12) ATP hydrolyzed re-energizing myosin head; (13) Process repeats while Ca²⁺ present. Relaxation: Ca²⁺ actively pumped back into SR by SERCA; Ca²⁺ unbinds troponin; tropomyosin blocks binding sites; muscle relaxes.`,
        professional: `Skeletal muscle molecular biology and excitation-contraction coupling:

Sarcomere ultrastructure: Z-disc (Z-line) - anchors thin filaments via α-actinin; contains titin (connectin) elastic filaments anchoring thick filaments. I-band - region with only thin filaments; contains actin, tropomyosin, troponin complex. A-band - region with thick filaments (myosin) and overlapping thin filaments. H-zone - central region of A-band with only thick filaments. M-line - center of sarcomere; contains myomesin, C-protein, creatine kinase. Filament composition: Thin filaments - helical polymer of G-actin monomers (double helix, 1 complete turn/77 nm, 13.5 monomers/turn); tropomyosin dimer (coiled-coil, 7 actin monomers per molecule) in groove between actin strands; troponin complex (TnT - binds tropomyosin; TnI - inhibits actin-myosin interaction; TnC - binds Ca²⁺) every 7 actin monomers. Thick filaments - myosin II molecules (two heavy chains with ATPase head and tail; four light chains - two regulatory, two essential) arranged with tails toward center, heads projecting outward (bare zone at center M-line). Titin (3-4 MDa) - giant elastic protein spanning half-sarcomere from Z-disc to M-line; provides passive elasticity, maintains thick filament position. Nebulin (~1 MDa) - associated with thin filament, regulates length.

Neuromuscular junction: Specialized synapse between motor neuron axon terminal and muscle fiber. Presynaptic terminal contains synaptic vesicles with acetylcholine (ACh, ~10,000 molecules/vesicle), active zones for vesicle release, voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. Synaptic cleft (50 nm wide) contains acetylcholinesterase (AChE) for ACh degradation. Postsynaptic membrane (motor end plate) has junctional folds increasing surface area, nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChR) concentrated on fold crests (ligand-gated Na⁺/K⁺ channels, pentameric: 2α, 1β, 1δ, 1ε in adult), voltage-gated Na⁺ channels concentrated at fold bases. Transmission: Action potential reaches terminal → VG Ca²⁺ channels open → Ca²⁺ influx → synaptic vesicle fusion (SNARE proteins) → quantal ACh release (~100 vesicles/action potential) → ACh diffuses across cleft → binds nAChR (2 ACh per receptor) → channel opens → Na⁺ influx, K⁺ efflux → end-plate potential (EPP, ~70 mV, always suprathreshold) → EPP triggers action potential in adjacent sarcolemma → AChE hydrolyzes ACh (0.1-0.2 ms) terminating signal.

Excitation-contraction coupling: Sequence linking surface membrane depolarization to Ca²⁺ release from SR. T-tubules (transverse tubules) - sarcolemmal invaginations at A-I junctions; carry action potential into fiber interior. Triad structure: T-tubule flanked by two terminal cisternae of SR. Protein machinery: Dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) - L-type Ca²⁺ channels in T-tubule membrane (tetrads of 4 DHPRs); voltage sensors. Ryanodine receptors (RyR1) - Ca²⁺ release channels on SR membrane; massive homotetramers (2.2 MDa each). Mechanical coupling: In skeletal muscle, DHPR physically interacts with RyR1 via foot processes; voltage change in DHPR mechanically opens RyR1 (no Ca²⁺ influx required for triggering). Ca²⁺ release: SR [Ca²⁺] ~1-2 mM; cytosolic [Ca²⁺] at rest ~100 nM; during contraction rises to 1-10 μM. Sarcoplasmic reticulum: Network surrounding myofibrils; terminal cisternae store Ca²⁺ bound to calsequestrin (high capacity, low affinity Ca²⁺ binding protein) and calreticulin.

Cross-bridge cycle: Biochemical-mechanical coupling. Step 1 - Energized myosin: ATP binds myosin head → ATP hydrolyzed to ADP + Pi (remains bound) → myosin head energized, cocked at 90° to actin. Step 2 - Cross-bridge formation: Ca²⁺ binds TnC → tropomyosin moves → myosin-binding sites exposed → energized myosin binds actin. Step 3 - Power stroke: Pi released → conformational change → myosin head pivots to 45° position → pulls thin filament ~10 nm toward M-line → ADP released. Step 4 - Detachment: ATP binds myosin → weakens actin-myosin binding → myosin detaches. Step 5 - Re-energizing: ATP hydrolyzed → myosin head returns to 90° position. Cycle repeats. Rate: 1-5 cycles/second in isometric contraction; shortening velocity depends on load (force-velocity relationship).

Regulation of contraction: Ca²⁺ control via troponin-tropomyosin. Rest: Tropomyosin blocks myosin-binding sites on actin. Activation: Ca²⁺ binds TnC (EF-hand motifs, binds 2 Ca²⁺ with high affinity) → conformational change transmitted via TnT to tropomyosin → tropomyosin rolls into groove → exposes binding sites → cross-bridges form. Relaxation: Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pumps Ca²⁺ back into SR (against 10,000-fold concentration gradient) using ATP; Ca²⁺ unbinds TnC; tropomyosin returns to blocking position. Rate of Ca²⁺ removal determines relaxation rate.

Muscle mechanics: Twitch - single stimulus → single contraction-relaxation cycle (latent period, contraction phase, relaxation phase ~100 ms). Summation - second stimulus before relaxation complete → greater force. Tetanus - high frequency stimulation → sustained maximal contraction (fused tetanus). Length-tension relationship: maximal force at optimal sarcomere length (~2.0-2.4 μm) where overlap of thick/thin filaments optimal; force decreases at shorter or longer lengths. Force-velocity relationship: velocity of shortening decreases as load increases; maximal velocity at zero load, zero velocity at maximal isometric force. Motor unit recruitment: size principle - small motor units (slow, fatigue-resistant) recruited first; larger units (fast, fatigable) recruited as force demands increase.`,

      title: 'Joints and Articulations',
      content: {
        patient: `Joints are where two or more bones meet. There are three main types. Fibrous joints are fixed and don't move, like the sutures between your skull bones. Cartilaginous joints allow limited movement, like the joints between your vertebrae. Synovial joints are freely movable and have a fluid-filled cavity - these include your knees, hips, shoulders, and fingers. Synovial joints have special features: articular cartilage (smooth covering on bone ends), a joint capsule enclosing the cavity, synovial fluid that lubricates the joint, and ligaments that provide stability. Different synovial joint shapes allow different movements: hinge (elbow, knee), ball-and-socket (hip, shoulder), pivot (neck), and others.`,
        intermediate: `Joints (articulations) are classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification: Fibrous joints - bones connected by fibrous tissue (dense regular CT), no cavity, generally immovable (synarthrosis). Types: sutures (skull bones, interlocked edges, fontanelles in infants), syndesmoses (tibia-fibula, radius-ulna - slight movement/amphiarthrosis), gomphoses (tooth in socket, periodontal ligament). Cartilaginous joints - bones connected by cartilage, no cavity. Types: synchondroses (hyaline cartilage, temporary like epiphyseal plate, or permanent like rib-sternum 1st rib), symphyses (fibrocartilage, slightly movable/amphiarthrosis, strong: pubic symphysis, intervertebral discs). Synovial joints - most common and most movable; bones separated by fluid-filled cavity; articular cartilage (hyaline) on bone ends; fibrous articular capsule (outer fibrous layer for strength, inner synovial membrane secreting synovial fluid); accessory ligaments (intracapsular, extracapsular); may have articular discs (menisci), bursae (fluid sacs reducing friction), or tendon sheaths. Synovial fluid: viscous, clear, derived from blood filtrate plus hyaluronic acid from synoviocytes; lubricates, nourishes cartilage, shock absorption. Functional classification: synarthrosis (immovable), amphiarthrosis (slightly movable), diarthrosis (freely movable). Synovial joint types by movement: plane/gliding (carpals, tarsals - sliding), hinge (elbow, knee, ankle - flexion/extension), pivot (atlantoaxial, radioulnar - rotation), condyloid/ellipsoid (wrist, metacarpophalangeal - flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction), saddle (thumb carpometacarpal - biaxial, more movement), ball-and-socket (shoulder, hip - multiaxial, greatest mobility).`,
        professional: `Joint classification and synovial joint anatomy:

Structural classification: Fibrous joints (synarthroses/immoveable): Sutures (cranial vault) - serrated (saw-tooth), squamous (beveled), plane/butt (flat), denticulate (tooth-like); become synostoses (ossified) in adulthood except between mandible and cranium. Syndesmoses - bones connected by ligaments/interosseous membrane; tibiofibular syndesmosis (interosseous membrane, anterior/posterior tibiofibular ligaments), radioulnar syndesmosis; permit slight movement (amphiarthrosis). Gomphoses - peg-in-socket; teeth in alveolar processes; periodontal ligament (dense fibrous CT) connects cementum to alveolar bone; shock-absorbing.

Cartilaginous joints: Synchondroses - hyaline cartilage; temporary (epiphyseal plates - permit growth, synostosis when fused) or permanent (first sternocostal joint, spheno-occipital during childhood). Symphyses - fibrocartilage (strong, compressible, resists tension); intervertebral discs (annulus fibrosus outer, nucleus pulposus inner), pubic symphysis (fibrocartilage disc, superior/inferior ligaments), manubriosternal joint (may synostose). Slight movement permitted (amphiarthrosis).

Synovial (diarthrodial) joints: Structural components: Articular cartilage - hyaline cartilage covering bone ends; avascular, aneural; receives nutrition from synovial fluid; loaded zones have thicker cartilage; surface zone (tangential collagen), middle zone (radial collagen), deep zone (radial collagen, mineralization front), calcified zone (bonded to bone). Articular capsule - fibrous layer (dense irregular CT, continuous with periosteum, provides strength, contains ligaments) and synovial membrane (intima: type A synoviocytes - macrophage-like, phagocytic; type B synoviocytes - fibroblast-like, produce hyaluronan and lubricin; highly vascular, 2-4 cell layers; subintima: loose CT with vessels and nerves). Joint cavity - potential space containing synovial fluid (1-4 mL in knee, plasma ultrafiltrate plus hyaluronic acid [2-3 mg/mL], lubricin, phospholipids; viscosity 10-100× water; functions: lubrication (boundary and fluid film), nutrient delivery to cartilage, shock absorption, phagocytic removal of debris). Accessory structures: Ligaments (capsular - thickened part of capsule, extracapsular - outside capsule, intracapsular - inside capsule but outside synovial membrane); articular discs/menisci (fibrocartilage, improve fit, distribute load, reduce friction); bursae (closed sacs with synovial lining, reduce friction between bone and tendon/skin/muscle); tendon sheaths (elongated bursae wrapping tendons, double-layered with parietal and visceral layers, mesotendon carries vessels).

Synovial joint classification by shape/axes: Uniaxial - movement in one plane. Hinge (ginglymus): convex cylinder in concave trough; elbow (humeroulnar), ankle (talocrural), knee (modified hinge); flexion/extension. Pivot (trochoid): rotating bone within ring; atlantoaxial (dens within atlas and transverse ligament), proximal radioulnar; rotation. Biaxial - movement in two planes. Condyloid (ellipsoid): oval convex articulating with elliptical concave; radiocarpal, metacarpophalangeal; flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, circumduction (no rotation). Saddle (sellar): each surface concave in one direction, convex in other; thumb carpometacarpal, sternoclavicular; biaxial with more movement than condyloid. Multiaxial - movement in all planes. Ball-and-socket (spheroidal): spherical head in cup-like socket; shoulder (glenohumeral - shallow socket, more mobile), hip (acetabulofemoral - deep socket, more stable); flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, rotation, circumduction. Plane/gliding (arthrodial): flat/curved surfaces; intercarpal, intertarsal, facet joints (zygapophyseal), sternocostal (2-7); gliding/sliding.

Special joints: Knee (tibiofemoral) - largest, most complex; hinge but with rotation (screw-home mechanism); menisci (medial - C-shaped, lateral - O-shaped, both attached to tibia and joint capsule, peripheral 1/3 vascular); ACL (anteromedial and posterolateral bundles, prevents anterior tibia translation), PCL (stronger than ACL, prevents posterior translation), MCL (flat, broad), LCL (cord-like); patellofemoral joint; suprapatellar bursa, prepatellar bursa, infrapatellar bursa. Shoulder - glenohumeral (ball-and-socket, shallow glenoid fossa, glenoid labrum deepens socket), acromioclavicular, sternoclavicular; rotator cuff (SITS muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis) provides dynamic stability. Hip - acetabulofemoral (ball-and-socket, deep acetabulum, acetabular labrum); strong ligaments (iliofemoral - Y-ligament of Bigelow, pubofemoral, ischiofemoral); highly stable, weight-bearing. Temporomandibular joint - modified hinge; mandibular condyle + articular disc + mandibular fossa; depression/elevation, protrusion/retrusion, lateral excursion.

Joint stability vs mobility: Inversely related. Highly mobile joints (shoulder) have less stability; highly stable joints (sacroiliac, hip) have less mobility. Factors affecting stability: bone shape (interlocking), ligaments (static), muscles/tendons (dynamic), negative intra-articular pressure.`,
