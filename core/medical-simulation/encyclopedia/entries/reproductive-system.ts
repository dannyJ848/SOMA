  summary: 'The reproductive system produces gametes, facilitates fertilization, and supports fetal development through male and female anatomical structures and hormonal regulation.',
  overview: {
    patient: 'The reproductive system is responsible for producing children. It includes different organs in males and females that work together to create new life. In males, the system produces sperm (male reproductive cells) and delivers them. In females, the system produces eggs (female reproductive cells), receives sperm, and can support a developing baby during pregnancy. The system is controlled by hormones that regulate the production of gametes and prepare the body for pregnancy.',
    intermediate: 'The reproductive system consists of primary sex organs (gonads - testes in males, ovaries in females) that produce gametes and sex hormones, plus accessory structures that facilitate gamete transport, fertilization, and fetal development. Male structures include the testes, duct system (epididymis, ductus deferens, ejaculatory duct), accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate, bulbourethral glands), and penis. Female structures include ovaries, uterine tubes, uterus, vagina, vulva, and mammary glands. Both systems are regulated by hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis hormones (GnRH, FSH, LH) in complex feedback loops.',
    professional: 'The reproductive system comprises the gonads (testes and ovaries) which perform gametogenesis (spermatogenesis and oogenesis) and steroidogenesis (androgens, estrogens, progestins), plus accessory reproductive organs. The male reproductive tract includes the testes (seminiferous tubules, Leydig cells), excurrent ducts (epididymis for sperm maturation, ductus deferens for transport, ejaculatory duct), accessory glands (seminal vesicles producing fructose-rich fluid, prostate producing alkaline fluid, bulbourethral glands producing pre-ejaculate), and external genitalia (penis, scrotum). The female reproductive tract includes the ovaries (containing follicles at various developmental stages), uterine tubes (amplulla, infundibulum with fimbriae), uterus (endometrium, myometrium, perimetrium), vagina, vulva (labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibular glands), and mammary glands. Both systems are regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis with pulsatile GnRH stimulating gonadotropin (FSH/LH) release, which regulates gametogenesis and steroidogenesis via negative and positive feedback loops.',

        patient: `The male reproductive system has two main jobs: producing sperm and delivering them to the female reproductive tract. The system includes:

TESTES (TESTICLES): Two oval organs located in the scrotum (a sac outside the body). The testes produce sperm and testosterone (the male sex hormone). Keeping them outside the body keeps sperm at the right temperature for development.

EPIDIDYMIS: A coiled tube sitting on the back of each testis. Sperm mature here and are stored until ejaculation.

DUCTUS DEFERENS (VAS DEFERENS): A muscular tube that carries sperm from the epididymis up through the scrotum and into the pelvic cavity during ejaculation.

ACCESSORY GLANDS: Three glands that add fluids to sperm to make semen:
- Seminal vesicles (2): Produce fluid rich in sugar (fructose) that nourishes sperm
- Prostate gland: Produces milky, alkaline fluid that helps sperm survive in the acidic vagina
- Bulbourethral glands (Cowper's glands): Produce clear pre-ejaculate fluid that lubricates the urethra

PENIS: The external organ that delivers sperm into the female reproductive tract. It contains erectile tissue that fills with blood during sexual arousal, making the penis firm. The urethra runs through the penis and carries both urine and semen (but not at the same time).`,
        intermediate: `MALE REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURES:

TESTES: Paired oval glands (4-5 cm long, 2.5 cm wide, 25-30g each) located in the scrotum. Each testis contains 250-300 lobules with 1-4 seminiferous tubules each (total length ~250m per testis). Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis; Leydig cells produce testosterone. Blood-testis barrier formed by tight junctions between Sertoli cells protects developing sperm. The scrotum regulates temperature (2-3°C below body temperature) via dartos muscle and cremaster muscle.

EPIDIDYMIS: C-shaped structure on posterolateral testis. Head (caput) receives sperm from rete testis via efferent ductules. Body (corpus) and tail (cauda) for storage. Pseudostratified columnar epithelium with stereocilia absorb fluid and phagocytose debris. Sperm undergo maturation (gain motility and fertilizing capacity) during 10-14 day transit.

DUCTUS DEFERENS (VAS DEFERENS): 45cm muscular tube from scrotum through inguinal canal into pelvic cavity, behind bladder, joins seminal vesicle duct to form ejaculatory duct. Three layers: mucosa (pseudostratified columnar), thick muscularis (three smooth muscle layers for peristalsis), adventitia. Can be surgically cut (vasectomy) for contraception.

EJACULATORY DUCT: Short ducts (2cm) passing through prostate to open into prostatic urethra. Carry sperm and seminal vesicle fluid.

ACCESSORY GLANDS:
- Seminal vesicles: Paired glands posteroinferior to bladder. Secretion constitutes 60-70% of semen volume; contains fructose (energy), prostaglandins (stimulate female tract contractions), fibrinogen (coagulation), bicarbonate (buffering).
- Prostate: Walnut-sized gland surrounding prostatic urethra. 30-50 compound tubuloalveolar glands in three zones (peripheral, central, transitional). Secretion: milky, slightly acidic fluid with citric acid, acid phosphatase, PSA (liquefies semen), seminalplasmin (antibacterial). Comprises 20-30% of semen.
- Bulbourethral glands (Cowper's): Pea-sized glands inferior to prostate. Pre-ejaculate fluid neutralizes urethral acidity and lubricates.

PENIS: Cylindrical external genitalia with root (attached to perineum), body (shaft), and glans (expanded tip covered by prepuce/foreskin). Three cylindrical erectile tissue masses: two dorsal corpora cavernosa (separated by septum) and ventral corpus spongiosum (surrounds urethra, expands as glans). Tunica albuginea surrounds each. Erection: parasympathetic stimulation → NO release → smooth muscle relaxation → arterial dilation → sinusoidal engorgement → compression of veins → rigidity.`,
        professional: `MALE REPRODUCTIVE ANATOMY - DETAILED:

Testicular Architecture: Tunica vaginalis (mesothelial lining from peritoneum), tunica albuginea (dense connective tissue capsule), septa dividing into lobules. Seminiferous tubules: convoluted portions (spermatogenesis) and straight tubuli recti (transport to rete testis). Interstitial tissue contains Leydig cells (polygonal, eosinophilic, abundant SER), macrophages, blood vessels, lymphatics. Mediastinum testis contains rete testis (network of channels).

Spermatogenic Cycle: Spermatogonia (stem cells, type A dark, type A pale, type B) → primary spermatocytes (46,XX or 46,XY, enter meiosis) → secondary spermatocytes (23,X or 23,Y, 2C DNA, brief existence) → spermatids (23,X or 23,Y, 1C DNA) → spermatozoa. Sertoli cells: tall columnar cells from base to lumen, tight junctions form blood-testis barrier (protects haploid germ cells from immune system), provide structural and metabolic support, phagocytose residual bodies, secrete inhibin, androgen-binding protein (ABP), fluid.

Excurent Duct System Histology: Efferent ductules (10-20 per testis): ciliated non-ciliated epithelium with alternating cell types, absorb fluid. Epididymis: pseudostratified columnar with stereocilia (long microvilli), principal cells absorb fluid and secrete glycoproteins for sperm surface changes, basal cells stem cells. Ductus deferens: pseudostratified columnar epithelium, extremely thick three-layer muscularis (inner longitudinal, middle circular, outer longitudinal).

Prostate Zones and Clinical Significance: Peripheral zone (70% of gland, most carcinomas arise here), central zone (25%, surrounds ejaculatory ducts), transitional zone (5%, around urethra, site of benign prostatic hyperplasia), anterior fibromuscular stroma (non-glandular). Prostatic fluid: pH 6.5, contains prostate-specific antigen (PSA, serine protease liquefies semen coagulum), prostatic acid phosphatase, citric acid, zinc, polyamines.

Penile Structure: Corpora cavernosa: cavernous spaces lined by endothelial cells, trabeculae with smooth muscle and collagen. Helicine arteries supply these spaces. Deep artery of penis enters each corpus cavernosum at crus. Emissary veins drain to deep dorsal vein. Corpus spongiosum: similar structure but smaller spaces, surrounds spongy (penile) urethra. Glans: distal expansion of corpus spongiosum. Prepuce: retractable fold of skin. Frenulum: ventral fold attaching prepuce to glans.

Erectile Physiology: Sexual stimulation → parasympathetic (pelvic splanchnic nerves S2-S4) and possibly sacral somatic activation → nitric oxide synthase activation in non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) nerve terminals and endothelial cells → NO → guanylate cyclase activation → cGMP ↑ → smooth muscle relaxation (erection). PDE5 breaks down cGMP (sildenafil inhibits PDE5). Sympathetic stimulation (L1-L2) causes ejaculation: emission (sperm and glandular secretions deposited in posterior urethra) and expulsion (bulbospongiosus and ischiocavernosus muscle contraction forces semen out). Detumescence: sympathetic activation, PDE5 activity, norepinephrine, endothelin-1 cause smooth muscle contraction.`,

      title: 'Female Reproductive Anatomy',
      content: {
        patient: `The female reproductive system produces eggs, receives sperm, and can nurture a developing baby. The system includes:

OVARIES: Two almond-sized organs on either side of the uterus. They produce eggs (ova) and female hormones (estrogen and progesterone). Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have.

UTERINE TUBES (FALLOPIAN TUBES): Two thin tubes that carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Fertilization usually happens here when sperm meets egg.

UTERUS (WOMB): A hollow, pear-shaped muscular organ where a baby develops. The lower narrow part is the cervix, which opens into the vagina. The inner lining (endometrium) thickens each month to prepare for pregnancy.

VAGINA: A muscular canal extending from the cervix to outside the body. It receives sperm during intercourse and serves as the birth canal during delivery.

VULVA: External female genitalia including the labia majora (outer folds), labia minora (inner folds), clitoris (sensitive tissue with many nerve endings), and openings for the urethra and vagina.

MAMMARY GLANDS: Breasts produce milk to nourish newborns. They develop during puberty and become fully functional after childbirth.`,
        intermediate: `FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE STRUCTURES:

OVARIES: Paired almond-shaped organs (3-5 cm long, 1.5-3 cm thick, 4-8g each) in ovarian fossa on lateral pelvic wall. Suspended by mesovarium, attached via suspensory ligament (contains ovarian vessels) and ovarian ligament (to uterus). Cortex contains follicles at various stages; medulla contains vessels, nerves, lymphatics. Two main functions: oogenesis (produce female gametes) and steroidogenesis (produce estrogen and progesterone).

UTERINE TUBES (FALLOPIAN TUBES/OVIDUCTS): 10-12 cm muscular tubes from uterine cornua to ovaries. Four regions: (1) Interstitial/intramural (within uterine wall, 1cm), (2) Isthmus (narrow, 3cm), (3) Ampulla (widest, fertilization usually occurs here, 5cm), (4) Infundibulum (funnel-shaped with fimbriae - finger-like projections that sweep over ovary to capture released egg). Mucosa with longitudinal folds, ciliated epithelium (cilia beat toward uterus), secretory peg cells. Muscularis for peristalsis. Covered by peritoneum.

UTERUS: Pear-shaped muscular organ (7.5 × 5 × 2.5 cm, 30-40g non-pregnant). Regions: fundus (dome-shaped top), body (main portion), isthmus (lower body), cervix (inferior neck projecting into vagina). Cervix has internal os (opening to uterine cavity) and external os (opening to vagina). Three layers: perimetrium (serosa), myometrium (thick smooth muscle with three indistinct layers - inner circular, middle interlacing, outer longitudinal), endometrium (mucosal lining with functional layer shed during menstruation and basal layer retained). Endometrium has simple columnar epithelium and uterine glands; functionalis layer contains spiral arteries.

VAGINA: Fibromuscular canal (7-10 cm anterior wall, 9-12 cm posterior wall) extending from cervix to vestibule. Position: anterior to rectum, posterior to bladder/urethra. Rugae (transverse folds) allow expansion. Layers: mucosa (non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium with glycogen-rich cells - acidified by lactobacilli to pH 3.8-4.5), muscularis (smooth muscle), adventitia. Functions: receives penis and semen, birth canal, menstrual flow exit.

VULVA (EXTERNAL GENITALIA): Mons pubis (fat pad over pubic symphysis with hair after puberty), labia majora (fatty folds homologous to scrotum), labia minora (inner folds, no fat, homologous to penile urethra), clitoris (erectile tissue homologous to penis - glans, body, two crura), vestibule (area between labia minora containing urethral and vaginal openings), vestibular bulbs (erectile tissue), greater vestibular glands (Bartholin's glands - mucus secretion), lesser vestibular glands (paraurethral/Skene's glands).

MAMMARY GLANDS: Modified sweat glands. Each breast contains 15-20 lobes of glandular tissue arranged radially; lobes contain lobules with alveoli (milk-producing). Lactiferous ducts converge at nipple surrounded by areola (darker pigmented area with Montgomery glands). Suspensory ligaments (Cooper's) support breast tissue. Fat determines breast size; glandular tissue responds to hormones.`,
        professional: `FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE ANATOMY - DETAILED:

Ovarian Structure: Tunica albuginea (dense connective tissue capsule) beneath germinal epithelium (simple cuboidal, misnomer as it does not produce germ cells). Cortex contains follicles at all stages: primordial (dormant, arrested in prophase I), primary (growing, single layer cuboidal granulosa), secondary (multiple granulosa layers, zona pellucida forming, theca developing), antral/Graafian (antrum fluid-filled, cumulus oophorus with oocyte, corona radiata). Medulla contains hilus cells (homologous to Leydig cells, produce androgens).

Uterine Tube Histology: Mucosa with primary, secondary, and tertiary folds creating labyrinthine lumen. Epithelium: ciliated cells (70%, cilia beat toward uterus, frequency varies with menstrual cycle - highest at ovulation), secretory peg cells (non-ciliated, secrete nutrients for gametes/embryo), intercalated cells (stem cells). Lamina propria is cellular connective tissue. Muscularis: inner circular, outer longitudinal (more developed in ampulla for peristalsis). Serosa: visceral peritoneum. Fimbriae have ciliated epithelium essential for oocyte capture.

Uterine Anatomy and Variants: Anteverted (body flexed forward on cervix, most common, 80%), retroverted (tipped backward, 20%, usually asymptomatic). Anteflexed (forward bend at isthmus), retroflexed (backward bend). Position changes with bladder/rectum distension. Uterine artery (branch of internal iliac) runs in cardinal ligament, crosses ureter ~2cm lateral to cervix ("water under the bridge" - important surgical landmark). Uterine venous plexus drains to internal iliac veins.

Endometrial Histology and Cyclic Changes: Basalis layer (permanent, contains basal portions of glands, gives rise to functionalis). Functionalis layer (shed during menses). Epithelium: simple ciliated columnar. Spiral arteries (coiled, responsive to hormones) supply functionalis; straight arteries supply basalis. Menstrual phase: ischemia → necrosis → shedding. Proliferative phase: estrogen-driven regeneration, straight glands, compact stroma. Secretory phase: progesterone-dominated, coiled glands with glycogen-rich secretion, edematous stroma, decidual reaction predecidual cells.

Vaginal Histology: Non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium without glands. Glycogen accumulation in superficial and intermediate cells (under estrogen influence). Lactobacillus acidophilus ferments glycogen to produce lactic acid from glycogen, maintaining acidic pH (3.8-4.5 typically) that inhibits pathogens. No distinct muscularis layer - smooth muscle interwoven with collagen and elastic fibers in lamina propria.

Vulvar Structures and Homologies: Clitoris: glans (highly innervated, 8000+ nerve endings), corpora cavernosa (erectile tissue), crura (attached to ischiopubic rami), suspensory ligament. Homologous to penis. Labia minora form prepuce (anterior fold over clitoris) and frenulum (posterior fold). Vestibular bulbs (erectile tissue on vaginal sides). Greater vestibular (Bartholin's) glands: compound tubuloalveolar, duct opens to vestibule at 5 and 7 o'clock positions, secrete mucus for lubrication. Skene's glands: paraurethral, open near urethral meatus, homologous to prostate.

Mammary Gland Histology: TDLU (terminal duct lobular unit) - functional unit. Type I lobules (virginal), Type II (early pregnancy), Type III (lactating). Alveoli: simple cuboidal secretory epithelium (lactocytes), myoepithelial cells (contract with oxytocin). Milk ejection reflex: oxytocin → myoepithelial contraction → milk flow. Colostrum: protein-rich first milk with antibodies.`,

      title: 'Gamete Formation: Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis',
      content: {
        patient: `GAMETES are reproductive cells - sperm in males and eggs (ova) in females. They are unique because they contain only half the normal number of chromosomes (23 instead of 46), so when they combine during fertilization, the resulting baby has the correct number (46).

SPERMATOGENESIS (Sperm Production):
This process occurs continuously in the testes from puberty throughout life. It takes about 74 days to make a sperm. The process occurs in three stages:

1. MITOSIS: Spermatogonia (stem cells) divide to produce more stem cells and cells that will become sperm.

2. MEIOSIS: These cells undergo two divisions to reduce chromosome number from 46 to 23. This creates four spermatids from each starting cell.

3. SPERMIOGENESIS: The round spermatids transform into streamlined sperm with a head (containing genetic material), midpiece (with mitochondria for energy), and tail (for swimming).

SPERM STRUCTURE: A mature sperm has:
- HEAD: Contains the nucleus with 23 chromosomes and acrosome (cap containing enzymes to penetrate the egg)
- MIDPIECE: Contains mitochondria that produce ATP for movement
- TAIL (FLAGELLUM): Whip-like structure for propulsion

OOGENESIS (Egg Production):
This process is very different from sperm production:
- It begins before birth when female fetuses produce all their eggs
- Eggs are arrested in development until puberty
- Each month, one egg completes its development and is released
- The process is completed only if fertilization occurs
- Women are born with ~1-2 million eggs; by puberty ~300,000 remain; only ~400-500 will mature and be released during reproductive years`,
        intermediate: `GAMETOGENESIS COMPARISON:

SPERMATOGENESIS: Continuous process from puberty through life in seminiferous tubules. Spermatogonia (stem cells, 2n, 2C) → primary spermatocytes (2n, 4C) enter meiosis I → secondary spermatocytes (n, 2C) undergo meiosis II → spermatids (n, 1C) differentiate → spermatozoa. Duration: ~74 days. Daily production: ~100-300 million. Four functional gametes per meiotic event.

MEIOSIS IN SPERMATOGENESIS:
- Meiosis I: Homologous chromosomes pair (synapsis), crossing over occurs, reduction division produces haploid secondary spermatocytes
- Meiosis II: Sister chromatids separate, equational division
- Spermatids undergo spermiogenesis without further division

OOGENESIS: Discontinuous process beginning in fetal life. Oogonia (stem cells) proliferate by mitosis in fetal ovary until 5th month, then arrest as primary oocytes in prophase I (diplotene/dictyate stage). No new oocytes formed after birth. Primary oocytes remain arrested until puberty, then resume meiosis I monthly. Meiosis I completed before ovulation → secondary oocyte + first polar body. Meiosis II arrests at metaphase II unless fertilization occurs. One functional gamete per meiotic event (plus polar bodies).

SPERM STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION:
Head: Anterior 2/3 covered by acrosome (modified lysosome containing hyaluronidase, acrosin, neuraminidase, phospholipase A). Posterior contains nucleus with haploid genome (highly condensed with protamines replacing histones). Post-acrosomal region contains oocyte-activating factors.

Neck: Contains proximal and distal centrioles. Distal centriole forms axoneme of flagellum.

Midpiece: Contains helically arranged mitochondria (70-80 in humans) wrapped around axoneme. Provides ATP for motility via oxidative phosphorylation.

Principal piece: Longest part of tail. Contains axoneme (9+2 microtubule arrangement: 9 outer doublets, 2 central singlets, dynein arms for sliding). Surrounded by fibrous sheath (outer dense fibers).

End piece: Terminal portion with only axoneme and plasma membrane.

MOTILITY: Wave-like beating of flagellum (3-4 mm/min progression). Progressive motility (straight-line) vs. non-progressive. Hyperactivation (increased amplitude, asymmetrical beating) occurs near ovulation and in female tract to facilitate penetration.

OOCYTE STRUCTURE:
Primary oocyte: Large cell (~120 μm), arrested in prophase I with intact germinal vesicle (nucleus). Zona pellucida (glycoprotein coat: ZP1, ZP2, ZP3, ZP4 - ZP3 is sperm receptor). Corona radiata (granulosa cells attached to zona). Cumulus oophorus (surrounding granulosa cells). Balbiani body (mitochondria, ER, Golgi concentrated near nucleus).

Secondary oocyte: Released at ovulation, arrested in metaphase II. Spindle located peripherally near first polar body (asymmetric division to preserve cytoplasm).`,
        professional: `MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF GAMETOGENESIS:

SPERMATOGENESIS REGULATION: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) maintained by GDNF (glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) from Sertoli cells. Retinoic acid triggers differentiation. KIT ligand from Sertoli cells binds KIT receptor on differentiating spermatogonia. Meiosis entry controlled by STRA8 (stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8). Sertoli cells form blood-testis barrier (tight junctions with occludin, claudin-11) creating adluminal and basal compartments.

MEIOTIC PROPHASE I EVENTS: Leptotene (chromosome condensation begins), zygotene (synapsis starts with synaptonemal complex protein SCP1, SCP3), pachytene (complete synapsis, crossing over via SPO11-induced DSBs, repair with homologous recombination), diplotene (synaptonemal complex dissolves, chiasmata visible), diakinesis (chromosomes maximally condensed). MSCI (meiotic sex chromosome inactivation) silences sex chromosomes in pachytene.

SPERMIOGENESIS: Round spermatids → elongated spermatids → spermatozoa. Key events: (1) Acrosome formation from Golgi (proacrosomal granules coalesce); (2) Nuclear condensation: histones → transition proteins → protamines (P1, P2, highly basic, allow tighter packing); (3) Flagellum formation from distal centriole; (4) Cytoplasmic reduction (residual bodies phagocytosed by Sertoli cells); (5) Sperm release (spermiation).

EPIDIDYMAL MATURATION: Sperm gain motility and fertilizing capacity. Surface protein changes: glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins added. Capacitation occurs in female tract: cholesterol removal from membrane, tyrosine phosphorylation, hyperactivation, acrosome reaction competence.

OOGENESIS MECHANISMS: Fetal oogonia (proliferating) → enter meiosis → arrest at dictyate (prophase I) by inhibitory factors (NOBOX, FIGLA, etc.). Follicle recruitment: primordial follicles activated by mTORC1 signaling, KIT ligand, bFGF. Monthly cyclic recruitment of antral follicles - FSH-dependent selection of dominant follicle. Ovulation triggered by LH surge: resumption of meiosis I (MPF - maturation promoting factor: cyclin B + Cdk1 activation), completion of meiosis I (asymmetric division → secondary oocyte + first polar body), entry into meiosis II and arrest at metaphase II (CSF - cytostatic factor: c-MOS, MAPK, CDK1).

FERTILIZATION TRIGGER: Sperm binding to ZP3 → acrosome reaction (exocytosis of acrosomal enzymes) → penetration of zona pellucida → sperm-oolemma fusion (IZUMO1 on sperm, JUNO/IZUMO1R on oocyte) → calcium oscillations (sperm PLCζ triggers IP3) → meiosis II completion → second polar body extrusion → pronucleus formation → syngamy.

POLAR BODY SIGNIFICANCE: First polar body may divide (meiosis II). Polar bodies contain minimal cytoplasm, serving to discard excess chromosomes while preserving oocyte cytoplasm for early embryo development. Can be used for genetic diagnosis (PGD) as genetically representative of oocyte.

GENETIC RECOMBINATION: Crossing over creates genetic diversity. Chiasma number correlates with chromosome length. Recombination frequency varies across genome (hotspots determined by PRDM9). Proper segregation requires at least one chiasma per chromosome pair (reductional division).`,

      title: 'Ovarian Cycle and Menstrual Cycle',
      content: {
        patient: `The menstrual cycle is a monthly series of changes that prepares a woman's body for pregnancy. It involves the ovaries (ovarian cycle) and the uterus (menstrual/uterine cycle), controlled by hormones from the brain and ovaries. The average cycle is 28 days but can range from 21-35 days.

THE OVARIAN CYCLE (what happens in the ovaries):

FOLLICULAR PHASE (Days 1-14): Several follicles (fluid-filled sacs containing eggs) begin to grow, but usually only one becomes dominant. The growing follicles produce estrogen. Estrogen helps thicken the uterine lining and triggers the LH surge that causes ovulation.

OVULATION (around Day 14): The mature follicle releases the egg. This is triggered by a sudden rise in luteinizing hormone (LH). The egg is swept into the uterine tube by the fimbriae.

LUTEAL PHASE (Days 15-28): The empty follicle transforms into the corpus luteum (yellow body), which produces progesterone. Progesterone prepares the uterus for pregnancy. If pregnancy doesn't occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, hormone levels drop, and a new cycle begins.

THE MENSTRUAL (UTERINE) CYCLE (what happens in the uterus):

MENSES (Days 1-5): The uterine lining sheds if no pregnancy occurred. This is the menstrual period.

PROLIFERATIVE PHASE (Days 6-14): Under estrogen influence, the uterine lining rebuilds and thickens. Glands grow, blood vessels proliferate.

SECRETORY PHASE (Days 15-28): Under progesterone influence, the lining becomes rich in nutrients and blood vessels, preparing to receive a fertilized egg. If no pregnancy, the corpus luteum fails, hormone levels drop, and the lining breaks down leading to menstruation.

HORMONAL CONTROL: The hypothalamus releases GnRH → pituitary releases FSH and LH → ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone → feedback to hypothalamus and pituitary regulates the cycle.`,
        intermediate: `OVARIAN CYCLE PHASES:

FOLLICULAR PHASE (Variable length, determines cycle length):
- Early: Recruitment of 5-12 antral follicles (2-5mm) from pool. FSH stimulates granulosa cell proliferation and aromatase activity.
- Selection: One follicle becomes dominant (FSH threshold theory - most sensitive follicle continues growing while others undergo atresia). Dominant follicle reaches 18-25mm.
- Estrogen production: Granulosa cells produce estradiol (two-cell, two-gonadotropin model: LH stimulates theca cells to produce androgens; FSH stimulates granulosa cells to aromatize androgens to estrogens).
- Negative feedback: Rising estrogen suppresses FSH (prevents multi-ovulation) but initially suppresses LH.
- Positive feedback switch: When estradiol remains >200 pg/mL for ~36 hours, it switches to positive feedback on GnRH neurons and pituitary → GnRH pulse amplitude increases → LH surge (~10-fold increase, 24-36 hours duration).

OVULATION:
- LH surge triggers: (1) Resumption of meiosis I → metaphase II arrest; (2) Expansion of cumulus oophorus; (3) Prostaglandin synthesis; (4) Plasminogen activator release → plasmin activation; (5) Inflammatory response.
- Follicular rupture: 10-12 hours after LH peak. Stigma (thin avascular spot) forms on follicle surface. Fimbriae sweep to capture oocyte-cumulus complex.

LUTEAL PHASE (Fixed 14 days if no pregnancy):
- Corpus luteum formation: Granulosa lutein cells (former granulosa cells, large, pale, produce progesterone), theca lutein cells (former theca cells, produce androgens). Extensive vascularization (from theca layer).
- Hormone production: High progesterone (dominant), moderate estradiol, inhibin A. Progesterone raises basal body temperature (thermogenic effect).
- Luteolysis: If no hCG from implanting embryo, corpus luteum degenerates after 14 days. Prostaglandin F2α from uterus may contribute. Fibrosis forms corpus albicans.

UTERINE (MENSTRUAL) CYCLE:

MENSTRUAL PHASE (Days 1-5, variable):
- Ischemic necrosis of functionalis layer due to progesterone/estrogen withdrawal
- Spiral artery constriction (vasospasm) → ischemia → necrosis
- Spiral artery relaxation → hemorrhage
- Shedding of functionalis layer (stratum functionalis)
- Blood loss average 30-40 mL (normal range 20-80 mL)
- Menstrual fluid contains blood, tissue fragments, prostaglandins, fibrinolysin (prevents clotting)

PROLIFERATIVE PHASE (Days 6-14):
- Estrogen-driven regeneration from basalis layer
- Epithelial proliferation from gland remnants
- Straight glands, simple columnar epithelium
- Stroma compact with little edema
- Spiral arteries elongate but remain straight
- Endometrium thickens from 1mm to 3-4mm
- Cervical mucus: estrogenic - abundant, watery, acellular, fern-like on drying, spinnbarkeit (stretchable)

SECRETORY PHASE (Days 15-28):
- Progesterone-dominated preparation for implantation
- Glandular tortuosity (saw-tooth appearance), glycogen accumulation (subnuclear vacuoles, then apical)
- Stromal edema (day 21-22 maximum - implantation window)
- Decidual predecidual reaction (stromal cells enlarge with glycogen/lipid)
- Spiral arteries become increasingly coiled
- Endometrium reaches 5-6mm
- Implantation window: days 20-24 (6-10 days post-ovulation)
- If no implantation: progesterone withdrawal → prostaglandin synthesis → spiral artery vasoconstriction → menstruation

HORMONAL REGULATION:
Hypothalamus (GnRH pulse generator, arcuate nucleus) → Anterior Pituitary (FSH, LH gonadotrophs) → Ovaries (estradiol, progesterone, inhibin) → Feedback.
- Negative feedback: Estradiol (low-moderate), progesterone, inhibin suppress FSH/LH
- Positive feedback: High sustained estradiol stimulates LH surge
- Pulse frequency: Follicular phase - GnRH every 60-90 min ( favors LH); Luteal phase - every 3-4 hours (progesterone slows, favors FSH)`,
        professional: `MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF CYCLIC REGULATION:

FOLLICULAR DEVELOPMENT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY:
Primordial follicle activation: mTORC1 signaling activated by KIT ligand, bFGF, IGF-1, insulin, and neurotrophins (NT4/5). PI3K/PTEN/Akt/FOXO3 pathway crucial - FOXO3 nuclear sequestration allows activation. AMH (anti-Müllerian hormone) from granulosa cells inhibits initial recruitment but doesn't block FSH-dependent cyclic recruitment.

Two-cell, two-gonadotropin model:
Theca interna cells: LH receptor → cAMP → StAR → P450scc (CYP11A1) → pregnenolone → 3β-HSD → progesterone → CYP17 (17α-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase) → androstenedione → 17β-HSD → testosterone. Theca cells lack aromatase.
Granulosa cells: FSH receptor → cAMP → aromatase (CYP19A1) induction → converts theca-derived androgens to estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2). FSH also induces LH receptors on granulosa cells (acquired in preovulatory follicle).

FSH threshold/window concept: Each follicle has threshold FSH concentration needed for continued development. Early follicular phase FSH levels sufficient for several follicles. As follicles grow, inhibin B and estradiol (and later inhibin A) suppress FSH. The most FSH-sensitive follicle (highest granulosa cell number) continues growing despite declining FSH; others undergo atresia (apoptosis).

DOMINANT FOLLICLE CHARACTERISTICS:
- 10-12mm when selected (days 5-7)
- ~18-25mm at ovulation
- Highest mitotic index in granulosa cells
- Most vascular (VEGF-induced angiogenesis)
- Largest antrum
- Expresses most FSH receptors and aromatase

OVULATION MECHANISM:
LH surge effects: (1) Cessation of granulosa cell proliferation; (2) Induction of meiosis resumption via EGF-like factors (amphiregulin, epiregulin) → EGF receptor → MAPK cascade → MPF activation; (3) Expansion of cumulus oophorus (hyaluronic acid synthesis); (4) Prostaglandin E2 synthesis; (5) Plasminogen activator production; (6) Increased follicular pressure and proteolytic enzyme activity.

Follicular rupture: LH/hCG receptors on granulosa and theca cells. Local inflammatory response: prostaglandins, histamine, bradykinin increase vascular permeability. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) digest follicular wall. Stigma formation: local ischemia and thinning. Smooth muscle contraction aids extrusion.

CORPUS LUTEUM PHYSIOLOGY:
Luteinization: LH binds LH receptors → cAMP → StAR → massive progesterone production (25-50 mg/day peak). VEGF-driven angiogenesis essential (inhibition causes luteolysis). Large lutein cells (former granulosa, 30-35 μm) produce most progesterone. Small lutein cells (former theca) produce androgens (substrate for estrogen).

Luteolysis mechanisms: (1) Functional - reduced LH support; (2) Structural - apoptosis and matrix degradation. Uterine PGF2α reaches ovary via counter-current exchange (vein to artery) in some species; role in humans less clear. Luteolytic cytokines: TNFα, Fas ligand. If pregnancy occurs: hCG from syncytiotrophoblast rescues corpus luteum (LH receptor binding) → corpus luteum of pregnancy maintained until placenta takes over (weeks 8-10).

ENDOMETRIAL MOLECULAR CHANGES:
Proliferative phase: Estrogen → ERα activation → c-fos, c-myc, cyclin D1 → proliferation. EGF, IGF-1, TGFα as mediators. Increased ER and PR expression.

Secretory phase: Progesterone → PR activation → differentiation. Glycodelin (PP14, endometrial protein) synthesis. Pregnancy-related changes: Decidualization (progesterone + cAMP) → IGFBP-1, prolactin, relaxin production. Pinopodes (uterodomes) - apical surface protrusions for embryo apposition, peak day 20-21.

Implantation window: Limited period when endometrium receptive. Pinopodes present, reduced MUC1 (anti-adhesive mucin), integrin expression (αvβ3), L-selectin ligands, heparin-binding EGF. Endometrial "receptivity array" of genes.

MENSTRUATION MECHANISM:
Progesterone withdrawal → prostaglandin synthesis (PGF2α, PGE2) via COX-2 induction → spiral artery vasoconstriction (local hypoxia, ischemia-reperfusion injury) → matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, -2, -3, -9, -12) activation → tissue degradation → shedding. Fibrinolysis prevents clotting (PAI-1 suppression). Re-epithelialization begins within 48 hours.

HORMONAL ASSAYS IN CYCLE MONITORING:
- Day 3 FSH: ovarian reserve assessment
- Estradiol: follicular development
- LH surge: ovulation predictor kits detect
- Mid-luteal progesterone: confirms ovulation (>10 ng/mL)
- Inhibin B: follicular health
- AMH: ovarian reserve (stable across cycle)`,

        patient: `PREGNANCY is the period when a fertilized egg develops into a baby inside the uterus. It typically lasts about 40 weeks (9 months) from the last menstrual period.

FERTILIZATION: Usually occurs in the uterine tube within 12-24 hours after ovulation. One sperm penetrates the egg, and their genetic material combines to form a zygote with 46 chromosomes.

IMPLANTATION: The developing embryo travels to the uterus and implants in the thickened lining about 6-10 days after fertilization.

PLACENTA: An organ that develops from both maternal and fetal tissues. It provides oxygen and nutrients to the baby, removes waste products, and produces hormones essential for maintaining pregnancy.

FETAL DEVELOPMENT STAGES:
- First trimester (Weeks 1-12): Major organs form, heartbeat begins, limbs develop
- Second trimester (Weeks 13-26): Baby grows larger, mother feels movement, sex can be determined
- Third trimester (Weeks 27-40): Rapid growth and weight gain, organs mature, baby positions for birth

HORMONES OF PREGNANCY:
- hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin): Produced by placenta, maintains corpus luteum, detected in pregnancy tests
- Progesterone: Maintains uterine lining, prevents contractions
- Estrogen: Promotes uterine growth and blood flow
- Human placental lactogen: Regulates glucose for baby

LABOR AND DELIVERY: The process of childbirth has three stages:

STAGE 1: Dilation - Contractions thin and open the cervix from 0 to 10 cm. This is the longest stage (12-18 hours for first pregnancies).

STAGE 2: Expulsion - Pushing and delivery of the baby. Contractions continue, and the mother pushes with them.

STAGE 3: Placental - Delivery of the placenta. Contractions separate the placenta from the uterine wall.

After delivery, the mother's body gradually returns to its pre-pregnancy state over several weeks.`,
        intermediate: `PREGNANCY PHYSIOLOGY:

FERTILIZATION AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT:
- Capacitation: Sperm modifications in female tract (cholesterol loss, protein changes) enable fertilization
- Acrosome reaction: ZP3 binding triggers enzyme release for zona penetration
- Cortical reaction: Oocyte releases enzymes preventing polyspermy
- Syngamy: Pronuclear fusion, first mitotic division
- Cleavage: Cell divisions without growth (zygote → 2-cell → 4-cell → morula)
- Blastocyst formation: Day 5, inner cell mass (embryoblast) and trophectoderm
- Hatching: Blastocyst escapes zona pellucida (day 5-6)
- Implantation: Apposition, adhesion, invasion (trophoblast invades endometrium)

PLACENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION:
- Chorionic villi: Trophoblast proliferates, forms finger-like projections
- Syncytiotrophoblast: Outer multinucleated layer, hormone production, nutrient/gas exchange
- Cytotrophoblast: Inner cellular layer, stem cells for syncytium
- Decidua basalis: Maternal portion (endometrial stroma modified by progesterone)
- Placental barrier: Syncytiotrophoblast, basement membrane, fetal capillary endothelium
- Functions: Gas exchange (O2/CO2), nutrient transport (glucose, amino acids, fatty acids), waste removal (urea, creatinine), hormone synthesis (hCG, hPL, progesterone, estrogens), immunologic protection

GESTATIONAL TIMING:
- Embryonic period: Weeks 3-8 (organogenesis, most vulnerable to teratogens)
- Fetal period: Week 9 to birth (growth and functional maturation)
- Trimesters: First (weeks 1-12), Second (13-26), Third (27-40)

FETAL CIRCULATION: Special adaptations before birth:
- Foramen ovale: Shunts blood from right to left atrium (bypasses lungs)
- Ductus arteriosus: Connects pulmonary artery to aorta (bypasses lungs)
- Ductus venosus: Shunts oxygenated blood from umbilical vein to inferior vena cava
- Umbilical vessels: Two arteries carry deoxygenated blood to placenta; one vein carries oxygenated blood to fetus

HORMONAL CONTROL OF PREGNANCY:
- hCG: Rescue of corpus luteum, peak weeks 8-10, detected 8-10 days post-implantation
- Progesterone: Corpus luteum weeks 1-8, placenta weeks 8-40. Maintains decidua, inhibits uterine contractions, immune modulation
- Estrogens: Estradiol early, estriol dominant later (fetal-placental unit: fetal adrenal DHEA-S → placental aromatization → estriol)
- Human placental lactogen (hPL): Growth hormone-like effects, mobilizes maternal fuels for fetus, anti-insulin effect
- Relaxin: Softens cervix, relaxes pelvic ligaments
- Prolactin: Breast development for lactation

LABOR PHYSIOLOGY:
Initiation mechanisms: Fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation → cortisol → placental CRH → prostaglandin synthesis. Progesterone withdrawal (functional, receptor changes) and estrogen activation. Oxytocin receptor upregulation in myometrium.

STAGE 1 (Cervical dilation):
- Latent phase: 0-3 cm, gradual, hours to days
- Active phase: 3-10 cm, faster dilation (~1 cm/hour)
- Transition: 8-10 cm, intense contractions
- Effacement: Thinning of cervix (0-100%)

STAGE 2 (Expulsion): Full dilation to baby delivery. Fetal descent, flexion, internal rotation, extension, external rotation (restitution), expulsion. Mother's pushing efforts augment contractions.

STAGE 3 (Placental separation): Signs: gush of blood, lengthening of cord, fundal rise. Placental separation from spongy layer, then expulsion by uterine contraction or gentle traction.

STAGE 4 (Immediate postpartum): 1-4 hours. Uterine contraction (oxytocin), bleeding control, vital stabilization.

PUERPERIUM (Postpartum period): 6 weeks for return to prepregnancy state. Uterine involution (oxytocin, breastfeeding stimulates contractions). Lochia (uterine discharge): rubra (3-4 days), serosa (4-10 days), alba (10-14 days). Lactation established.`,
        professional: `ADVANCED PREGNANCY AND OBSTETRIC PHYSIOLOGY:

IMPLANTATION MOLECULAR MECHANISMS:
Blastocyst signaling: hCG from syncytiotrophoblast maintains corpus luteum, also modulates endometrial receptivity via LHB receptor. IL-1, LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), IGFs, EGF family members coordinate implantation.

Trophoblast invasion: Similar to tumor invasion but tightly regulated. Extravillous trophoblast invades decidua and myometrium (interstitial invasion) and spiral arteries (endovascular invasion). Cell adhesion molecules change: integrin switch (α6β4 to α1β1), E-cadherin to VE-cadherin. MMPs (especially MMP-9) degrade matrix. uPA/uPAR system activates plasmin. HLA-G expression by extravillous trophoblast protects from NK cell killing.

Spiral artery transformation: Endovascular trophoblast replaces endothelial cells and muscularis, converting high-resistance vessels to low-resistance capacitance vessels. Inadequate invasion associated with preeclampsia and IUGR.

PLACENTAL TRANSPORT MECHANISMS:
- Simple diffusion: O2, CO2, steroid hormones, fat-soluble vitamins
- Facilitated diffusion: Glucose (GLUT1, GLUT3)
- Active transport: Amino acids (System A, ASC, L), calcium (Ca2+-ATPase), iron (transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis), IgG (FcRn receptor)
- Pinocytosis: Proteins, viruses
- Exclusion: Large proteins, most drugs by P-glycoprotein

PLACENTAL ENDOCRINOLOGY:
hCG: α-subunit identical to LH/FSH/TSH; β-subunit unique (diagnostic specificity). Promotes progesterone production, stimulates thyroid (weak TSH activity), promotes angiogenesis, may have immunomodulatory effects.

Fetal-placental unit: Fetal adrenal cortex (definitive zone small, fetal zone large producing DHEA-S) provides substrate. Placental sulfatase desulfates; 3β-HSD converts to androstenedione; aromatase (CYP19, highly expressed in placenta) converts to estrone/estradiol/estriol. Estriol reflects fetal well-being (requires functional fetal adrenal, liver 16α-hydroxylation, and placental aromatase).

Progesterone production: Maternal cholesterol → placental mitochondria (P450scc) → pregnenolone → 3β-HSD → progesterone. >250 mg/day by third trimester. Prevents myometrial contraction (decreases gap junctions, prevents Ca2+ influx, maintains cAMP), inhibits cell-mediated immunity (protects fetus).

hPL (human chorionic somatomammotropin): Growth hormone variant. Mobilizes maternal FFA, decreases glucose utilization, promotes breast development. Levels correlate with placental mass.

MATERNAL PHYSIOLOGIC ADAPTATIONS:
Cardiovascular: CO increases 30-50% (stroke volume increase early, HR later). Blood volume increases 40-50% (plasma > red cells → physiologic anemia). SVR decreases. BP typically drops 10-15 mmHg by 2nd trimester, returns to baseline by 3rd.

Respiratory: TV increases, RV decreases. Minute ventilation increases 30-40% (progesterone stimulation). Respiratory alkalosis (pCO2 ~30) with metabolic compensation (HCO3- ~20). Dyspnea common.

Renal: GFR increases 40-50%, creatinine clearance increases. Glycosuria (exceeds reabsorptive capacity). Dilated collecting system (progesterone + mechanical obstruction).

GI: Decreased motility (progesterone), GERD common. Constipation. GB emptying slowed.

Endocrine: Insulin resistance (hPL, cortisol, progesterone). Postprandial hyperglycemia. Islet hyperplasia. Elevated TBG (estrogen), total T3/T4 up, free T3/T4 stable. Elevated cortisol (CBG increased, clearance decreased, but free cortisol only modestly elevated).

LABOR MECHANISMS:
Uterine contractility: Myometrial smooth muscle contraction via actin-myosin interaction, Ca2+-calmodulin dependent. Gap junction formation (connexin-43) allows coordinated contractions. Oxytocin receptors increase dramatically in labor.

Cervical ripening: Softening, thinning, dilation before labor. Prostaglandins (PGE2, PGF2α), relaxin, nitric oxide, MMPs involved. Collagen remodeling (decreased cross-linking, increased solubility). Glycosaminoglycans increase (hold water, soften).

Partogram components: Cervical dilation, fetal descent (station), contraction frequency/duration/intensity, fetal heart rate, maternal vitals.

Fetal position: Occiput anterior (OA) most favorable for delivery. LOA, ROA common. OP (occiput posterior) associated with back labor, longer second stage.

Mechanism of labor (cardinal movements): Descent (ongoing), Flexion (occiput to center), Internal rotation (OA position), Extension (under symphysis), External rotation/restitution (shoulders rotate), Expulsion (delivery of shoulders and body).

Puerperal involution: Myometrial ischemia (vessels constricted by contraction) promotes necrosis and sloughing. Oxytocin from breastfeeding stimulates uterine contraction (afterbirth pains). Fundus at umbilicus immediately postpartum, descends ~1 cm/day. By 2 weeks, not palpable abdominally. Complete involution ~6 weeks.

Lactation physiology: Prolactin from anterior pituitary stimulates milk production (galactopoiesis). Oxytocin from posterior pituitary causes milk ejection (let-down reflex). Colostrum (first 2-3 days): protein-rich, antibodies, lactoferrin, growth factors. Mature milk: 87% water, 7% lactose, 4% fat, 1% protein. Supply determined by infant demand.

Contraceptive physiology postpartum: Lactational amenorrhea (prolactin suppresses GnRH → anovulation) effective if: <6 months postpartum, amenorrheic, exclusively breastfeeding.`,
