# Fats (Lipids)

## Overview
Fats are energy-dense macromolecules providing 9 kilocalories per gram. They serve as essential components of cell membranes, hormone precursors, carriers for fat-soluble vitamins, insulation, and long-term energy storage. Dietary fats encompass triglycerides, phospholipids, and sterols with diverse metabolic roles.

## Level 1: Basic Understanding

### What Are Fats?
Fats are nutrients that give your body energy and help it absorb certain vitamins. They're found in foods like oils, butter, nuts, and meat.

**Types of Fats**
- **Unsaturated fats (Healthy fats)**: Found in olive oil, nuts, avocados, fish
- **Saturated fats**: Found in butter, cheese, fatty meats
- **Trans fats (Unhealthy)**: Found in some processed foods, fried foods

### Why You Need Fat
- Gives you energy
- Helps absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K
- Keeps your skin and hair healthy
- Protects your organs
- Keeps you warm

### Good Fat Choices
- Olive oil and avocado oil
- Nuts and seeds
- Fatty fish (salmon, sardines)
- Avocados

### Fats to Limit
- Fried foods
- Processed snacks with trans fats
- Large amounts of butter and fatty meats

### How Much Fat Do You Need?
- About 20-35% of daily calories
- Focus on unsaturated fats
- Avoid trans fats completely

## Level 2: Intermediate Understanding

### Fat Classification

**By Saturation Level**

| Type | Structure | State at Room Temp | Sources |
|------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| Saturated | No double bonds | Solid | Butter, coconut oil, meat |
| Monounsaturated | One double bond | Liquid | Olive oil, avocados, nuts |
| Polyunsaturated | Multiple double bonds | Liquid | Fish oil, corn oil, walnuts |
| Trans | Hydrogen across double bond | Solid | Hydrogenated oils, some margarines |

**Essential Fatty Acids**
Your body cannot make these, so you must get them from food:
- **Omega-6 (Linoleic acid)**: Vegetable oils, nuts, seeds
- **Omega-3 (Alpha-linolenic acid)**: Flaxseed, walnuts, fatty fish

**Omega-3 Types**
| Type | Full Name | Source |
|------|-----------|--------|
| ALA | Alpha-linolenic acid | Flaxseed, walnuts, chia seeds |
| EPA | Eicosapentaenoic acid | Fatty fish, fish oil |
| DHA | Docosahexaenoic acid | Fatty fish, algae |

### Cholesterol

**Types of Cholesterol Carriers**
- **LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein)**: Carries cholesterol to tissues
- **HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)**: Removes cholesterol from arteries
- **VLDL**: Carries triglycerides from liver

**Healthy Lipid Levels**
| Marker | Desirable |
|--------|-----------|
| Total Cholesterol | <200 mg/dL |
| LDL Cholesterol | <100 mg/dL |
| HDL Cholesterol | >40 mg/dL (men), >50 mg/dL (women) |
| Triglycerides | <150 mg/dL |

### Fat Digestion
1. **Mouth**: Lingual lipase begins small amount of digestion
2. **Stomach**: Gastric lipase works on short-chain fats
3. **Small intestine**: Bile emulsifies fats; pancreatic lipase digests
4. **Micelles**: Carry products to intestinal wall
5. **Absorption**: Fatty acids absorbed into intestinal cells
6. **Chylomicrons**: Transport fat through lymph system

### Daily Fat Recommendations
- Total fat: 20-35% of calories
- Saturated fat: <10% of calories
- Trans fat: As low as possible
- Essential fatty acids: 1-2% of calories each

Arachidonic acid → Prostaglandins (series 2), Leukotrienes (series 4), Thromboxanes (series 2)

**Omega-3 Pathway**
Alpha-linolenic acid → EPA → DHA
EPA → Prostaglandins (series 3), Leukotrienes (series 5), Resolvins, Protectins

## Level 4: Expert Understanding

### Lipoprotein Metabolism

**Chylomicron Pathway (Exogenous)**
1. Dietary fat absorbed → chylomicrons formed in enterocyte
2. ApoB-48, ApoA-I assembled in ER
3. Chylomicrons enter lymph → thoracic duct → blood
4. Acquire ApoC-II and ApoE from HDL
5. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on capillary endothelium hydrolyzes TG
6. Released fatty acids taken up by tissues
7. Chylomicron remnant cleared by liver LDL-receptor related protein (LRP)

**VLDL/LDL Pathway (Endogenous)**
1. Liver synthesizes VLDL with ApoB-100
2. VLDL secreted, acquires ApoC-II, ApoE
3. LPL hydrolyzes triglycerides → IDL
4. IDL: Either cleared by liver or further processed
5. Hepatic lipase converts IDL → LDL
6. LDL delivers cholesterol to peripheral tissues
7. LDL cleared by LDL receptors

**HDL and Reverse Cholesterol Transport**
1. Nascent HDL (ApoA-I) secreted by liver and intestine
2. ABCA1 transporter loads free cholesterol
3. LCAT esterifies cholesterol → mature HDL
4. HDL delivers cholesterol to liver via SR-B1
5. CETP: Exchanges cholesterol esters for TG with VLDL/LDL
6. Removes cholesterol from peripheral tissues

### Fatty Acid Oxidation

**Carnitine Shuttle (Long-Chain FA)**
1. Fatty acyl-CoA formed in cytoplasm (acyl-CoA synthetase)
2. CPT-I: Fatty acyl-CoA + carnitine → fatty acylcarnitine
3. Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase: Transport across inner membrane
4. CPT-II: Fatty acylcarnitine → fatty acyl-CoA + carnitine
5. Acyl-CoA enters beta-oxidation in matrix

**Beta-Oxidation Spiral**
Each cycle produces:
- 1 Acetyl-CoA (2C)
- 1 FADH2 (1.5 ATP)
- 1 NADH (2.5 ATP)

For palmitate (16:0):
- 7 cycles of beta-oxidation
- 8 Acetyl-CoA → 8 × 10 = 80 ATP (citric acid cycle)
- 7 FADH2 → 7 × 1.5 = 10.5 ATP
- 7 NADH → 7 × 2.5 = 17.5 ATP
- Total: 108 ATP - 2 ATP (activation) = 106 ATP net

**Unsaturated Fatty Acid Oxidation**
- Requires additional enzymes
- 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase
- Enoyl-CoA isomerase
- Slightly less energy yield

### Fatty Acid Synthesis

**Pathway (Cytoplasm)**
1. Acetyl-CoA exported via citrate shuttle
2. ATP citrate lyase: Citrate → Acetyl-CoA + OAA
3. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC): Acetyl-CoA → Malonyl-CoA (rate-limiting)
4. Fatty acid synthase: Builds 16-carbon palmitate
5. Elongases and desaturases modify chain

**Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS)**
- Multienzyme complex
- Uses acetyl-CoA (starter) + malonyl-CoA (extender)
- Requires NADPH (from pentose phosphate pathway)
- Product: Palmitate (16:0)

**Regulation of Lipogenesis**
- Insulin: Activates ACC, increases FAS expression
- Glucagon: Inhibits ACC via AMPK
- SREBP-1c: Master transcriptional regulator
- ChREBP: Carbohydrate-responsive regulation

### Cholesterol Metabolism

**Synthesis (Endogenous)**
- All tissues can synthesize, primarily liver
- Starting material: Acetyl-CoA
- Rate-limiting enzyme: HMG-CoA reductase
- Statin drugs inhibit HMG-CoA reductase
- ~1 gram synthesized daily

**Regulation**
- SREBP-2: Sterol-sensitive transcription factor
- Low cholesterol: SREBP-2 activates, increases synthesis
- High cholesterol: SREBP-2 inhibited, decreases synthesis
- Cholesterol also regulates LDL receptor expression

**Bile Acid Synthesis**
- Primary pathway for cholesterol elimination
- 7α-hydroxylase: Rate-limiting enzyme
- Primary bile acids: Cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid
- Conjugated with glycine or taurine
- Enterohepatic circulation recycles ~95%
