# Dietary Fiber

## Overview
Dietary fiber comprises non-digestible carbohydrate polymers and lignin that resist hydrolysis by human digestive enzymes. While not providing significant calories, fiber plays critical roles in gastrointestinal health, metabolic regulation, cardiovascular protection, and gut microbiome function.

## Level 1: Basic Understanding

### What Is Fiber?
Fiber is the part of plant foods your body cannot digest. Unlike other nutrients, fiber passes through your digestive system mostly unchanged.

**Why You Need Fiber**
- Keeps your digestive system healthy
- Helps you feel full longer
- Lowers cholesterol
- Controls blood sugar
- Prevents constipation

**Two Types of Fiber**
- **Soluble fiber**: Dissolves in water, forms a gel
  - Found in oats, beans, apples, citrus fruits
  - Helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar

- **Insoluble fiber**: Does not dissolve in water
  - Found in whole wheat, nuts, vegetables
  - Helps food move through your digestive system

### Good Sources of Fiber
| Food | Fiber (grams) |
|------|---------------|
| 1 cup black beans | 15 |
| 1 cup raspberries | 8 |
| 1 medium pear | 6 |
| 1 cup oatmeal | 4 |
| 1 slice whole wheat bread | 2 |

### How Much Fiber Do You Need?
- Women: 25 grams per day
- Men: 38 grams per day
- Most people get only about 15 grams per day
