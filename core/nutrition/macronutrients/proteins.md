# Proteins

## Overview
Proteins are complex macromolecules composed of amino acid chains that serve as the fundamental building blocks for tissues, enzymes, hormones, and virtually every cellular structure and function. Providing 4 kilocalories per gram, proteins are essential for growth, repair, immune function, and metabolic regulation.

## Level 1: Basic Understanding

### What Are Proteins?
Proteins are made up of smaller units called amino acids, linked together like beads on a string. Your body uses proteins to build and repair tissues.

**Why You Need Protein**
- Build and repair muscles
- Make enzymes that help with digestion
- Create hormones that control body functions
- Support your immune system
- Provide energy when needed

**Good Sources of Protein**
- **Animal sources**: Meat, fish, eggs, dairy, poultry
- **Plant sources**: Beans, lentils, nuts, tofu, quinoa

### How Much Protein Do You Need?
- Most adults: About 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight
- For a 70 kg (154 lb) person: About 56 grams per day
- Athletes may need more

### Complete vs. Incomplete Proteins
- **Complete proteins**: Have all amino acids you need (meat, eggs, dairy)
- **Incomplete proteins**: Missing some amino acids (most plant foods)
- You can combine incomplete proteins to get all amino acids

## Level 2: Intermediate Understanding

### Amino Acid Classification

**Essential Amino Acids (Must Get from Food)**
| Amino Acid | Function | Food Sources |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| Histidine | Histamine production, pH buffering | Meat, fish, dairy |
| Isoleucine | Muscle metabolism, immunity | Eggs, meat, nuts |
| Leucine | Muscle protein synthesis | Dairy, meat, legumes |
| Lysine | Calcium absorption, collagen | Meat, eggs, beans |
| Methionine | Metabolism, detoxification | Eggs, meat, fish |
| Phenylalanine | Neurotransmitter precursor | Dairy, meat, nuts |
| Threonine | Collagen, elastin | Meat, dairy, eggs |
| Tryptophan | Serotonin precursor | Turkey, milk, oats |
| Valine | Muscle growth, tissue repair | Meat, dairy, soy |

**Non-Essential Amino Acids (Body Can Make)**
- Alanine, Asparagine, Aspartic acid, Glutamic acid

**Conditionally Essential Amino Acids**
- Arginine, Cysteine, Glutamine, Glycine, Proline, Tyrosine
- Essential during illness, stress, or rapid growth

### Protein Quality

**Biological Value (BV)**
Measures how much of the absorbed protein is actually used by the body:
| Protein Source | Biological Value |
|----------------|------------------|
| Whey protein | 104 |
| Whole egg | 100 |
| Milk | 91 |
| Beef | 80 |
| Soy | 74 |
| Wheat | 64 |

**Protein Digestibility-Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS)**
- Ranges from 0 to 1.0
- Accounts for both amino acid profile and digestibility
- Casein, egg, whey, soy: 1.0
- Beef: 0.92
- Chickpeas: 0.78

### Protein Digestion
1. **Stomach**: HCl denatures proteins; pepsin begins breakdown
2. **Small Intestine**: Pancreatic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin) continue digestion
3. **Brush Border**: Peptidases break dipeptides and tripeptides
4. **Absorption**: Free amino acids and small peptides absorbed into bloodstream

### Protein Recommendations by Group
| Population | Grams per kg body weight |
|------------|--------------------------|
| Sedentary adults | 0.8 |
| Recreational exercisers | 1.0-1.2 |
| Endurance athletes | 1.2-1.4 |
| Strength athletes | 1.6-2.2 |
| Older adults (65+) | 1.0-1.2 |

## Level 3: Advanced Understanding

### Protein Structure

**Primary Structure**
- Linear sequence of amino acids
- Determined by genetic code
- Peptide bonds link amino acids
- N-terminus to C-terminus directionality

**Secondary Structure**
- Alpha helix: Spiral stabilized by hydrogen bonds
- Beta sheet: Parallel or antiparallel strands
- Loops and turns: Connect structured regions

**Tertiary Structure**
- Overall 3D shape of single polypeptide
- Stabilized by:
  - Disulfide bonds (cysteine residues)
  - Hydrophobic interactions
  - Ionic bonds
  - Hydrogen bonds

**Quaternary Structure**
- Multiple polypeptide subunits
- Example: Hemoglobin (4 subunits)

### Protein Turnover

**Synthesis Rate**
- Muscle protein synthesis (MPS): ~1-2% per day
- Liver protein turnover: Much higher
- Whole-body protein synthesis: ~300 g/day

**Breakdown (Proteolysis)**
- Ubiquitin-proteasome system: Tags and degrades proteins
- Autophagy: Lysosomal degradation
- Calpains: Calcium-dependent proteases

**Net Protein Balance**
Net balance = Muscle Protein Synthesis - Muscle Protein Breakdown
- Positive: Muscle growth (hypertrophy)
- Negative: Muscle loss (atrophy)
- Feeding and exercise influence both

### Protein Timing

**Muscle Protein Synthesis Response**
- Peaks 1-3 hours after protein intake
- Elevated for 4-5 hours
- Refractory period: ~4-5 hours before next maximal response

**Leucine Threshold**
- 2-3 g leucine needed to maximally stimulate MPS
- Older adults may need higher threshold (4+ g)
- ~25-30 g high-quality protein typically reaches threshold

**Distribution Throughout Day**
- Even distribution (20-40 g per meal) optimizes MPS
- Protein at breakfast often underconsumed
- Pre-sleep protein may enhance overnight recovery

### Nitrogen Balance

**Nitrogen Balance Equation**
N balance = Nitrogen intake - Nitrogen excretion

**Measurement**
- Protein = Nitrogen x 6.25 (average 16% nitrogen in protein)
- Excretion: Urine urea, fecal nitrogen, skin losses
- Positive balance: Anabolism
- Negative balance: Catabolism

**Factors Affecting Nitrogen Balance**
- Energy intake: Inadequate energy increases protein catabolism
- Exercise: Increases both synthesis and breakdown
- Illness/injury: Dramatically increases protein requirements
- Age: Decreased anabolic sensitivity

## Level 4: Expert Understanding

### Amino Acid Metabolism

**Transamination and Deamination**
- Transaminases (ALT, AST) transfer amino groups
- Alpha-ketoglutarate is common amino group acceptor
- Oxidative deamination: Glutamate → α-ketoglutarate + NH4+
- Ammonia converted to urea in liver

**Urea Cycle**
1. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I: NH4+ + CO2 + 2 ATP → Carbamoyl phosphate
2. Ornithine transcarbamylase: Carbamoyl phosphate + Ornithine → Citrulline
3. Argininosuccinate synthetase: Citrulline + Aspartate → Argininosuccinate
4. Argininosuccinate lyase: Argininosuccinate → Arginine + Fumarate
5. Arginase: Arginine → Urea + Ornithine

**Carbon Skeletons**
Glucogenic amino acids: Can be converted to glucose
- Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Aspartate, Cysteine, Glutamate, Glutamine, Glycine, Histidine, Methionine, Proline, Serine, Valine, Threonine

**Whole-Body Protein Flux**
Q = S + O = B + I
Where: Q = flux, S = synthesis, O = oxidation, B = breakdown, I = intake
