# Water and Hydration

## Overview
Water is the most abundant substance in the human body, comprising 50-70% of body weight. As an essential nutrient, water participates in virtually every physiological process including temperature regulation, nutrient transport, waste elimination, and biochemical reactions. Maintaining proper hydration is critical for cellular function and overall health.

## Level 3: Advanced Understanding

### Water Functions in the Body

**Solvent Properties**

- Dissolves polar and ionic compounds
- Enables biochemical reactions
- Facilitates nutrient and waste transport

**Temperature Regulation**
- High specific heat (4.18 J/g/°C)
- Stabilizes body temperature
- Heat dissipation through sweating
- Evaporative cooling: 580 kcal/L evaporated

**Metabolic Participation**

### Regulation of Body Water

**Thirst Mechanism**
1. Plasma osmolality increases or blood volume decreases
2. Hypothalamic osmoreceptors detect changes
3. Thirst center activated
4. Conscious sensation of thirst
5. Behavioral drinking response

*Note: Thirst lags behind actual dehydration; not reliable for prevention*

**Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH/Vasopressin)**
1. Increased plasma osmolality detected
2. Hypothalamic osmoreceptors signal
3. Posterior pituitary releases ADH
4. ADH acts on kidney collecting ducts
5. Aquaporin-2 channels inserted
6. Water reabsorption increases
7. Concentrated urine produced

**Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS)**
1. Decreased renal perfusion or sodium
2. Renin released from juxtaglomerular cells
3. Angiotensinogen → Angiotensin I → Angiotensin II
4. Angiotensin II: Vasoconstriction, aldosterone release
5. Aldosterone: Sodium reabsorption (water follows)
6. Blood volume and pressure restored

### Electrolyte Balance

**Key Electrolytes**
| Electrolyte | Plasma Range | Primary Compartment |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| Sodium (Na+) | 136-145 mEq/L | Extracellular |
| Potassium (K+) | 3.5-5.0 mEq/L | Intracellular |
| Chloride (Cl-) | 98-106 mEq/L | Extracellular |
| Bicarbonate (HCO3-) | 22-28 mEq/L | Both |

**Sodium and Water Movement**
- "Water follows sodium"
- Na+/K+-ATPase maintains gradients
- Osmotic pressure determines water distribution
- Sodium concentration reflects water status

### Sweat and Exercise

|--------|----------------|
| Pre-exercise (2-4 hours) | 5-7 mL/kg body weight |
| During exercise | 400-800 mL/hour (individualize) |
| Post-exercise | 1.25-1.5 L per kg lost |

2. cAMP-PKA signaling activated
3. AQP2-containing vesicles phosphorylated
4. Vesicle trafficking to apical membrane
5. Fusion and AQP2 insertion
6. Increased water permeability

### Osmolality Regulation

**Normal Plasma Osmolality**
- Range: 280-295 mOsm/kg
- Tightly regulated (±2%)
- Calculated: 2(Na) + Glucose/18 + BUN/2.8

**Osmolal Gap**
Measured osmolality - Calculated osmolality
- Normal: <10 mOsm/kg
- Elevated: Suggests unmeasured osmoles (methanol, ethylene glycol, etc.)

**Set Point Adjustments**
- Pregnancy: Lower set point (~5 mOsm/kg)
- Elderly: Higher threshold for ADH release
- Chronic illness: Various alterations

### Fluid Compartment Dynamics

**Starling Forces**
Jv = Kf [(Pc - Pi) - σ(πc - πi)]

Where:
- Jv = Net fluid movement
- Kf = Filtration coefficient
- Pc = Capillary hydrostatic pressure
- Pi = Interstitial hydrostatic pressure
- πc = Capillary oncotic pressure
- πi = Interstitial oncotic pressure
- σ = Reflection coefficient

**Edema Formation**
- Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (heart failure)
- Decreased plasma oncotic pressure (low albumin)
- Increased capillary permeability (inflammation)
- Lymphatic obstruction

### Hyponatremia Pathophysiology

**Classification by Osmolality**
- Hypotonic: True dilutional (most common)
- Isotonic: Pseudohyponatremia (lipids, proteins)
- Hypertonic: Translocational (glucose)

**Classification by Volume Status**
| Volume Status | Causes |
|---------------|--------|
| Hypovolemic | Diuretics, vomiting, diarrhea |
| Euvolemic | SIADH, hypothyroidism, polydipsia |
| Hypervolemic | Heart failure, cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome |

**Exercise-Associated Hyponatremia (EAH)**
- Excessive water intake during prolonged exercise
- ADH inappropriately elevated
- Risk factors: Slow pace, high intake, weight gain
- Prevention: Drink to thirst, not schedule

### Hypernatremia Pathophysiology

**Causes**
1. Water loss > Sodium loss
   - Insensible losses (fever, burns)
   - Renal losses (diabetes insipidus)
   - GI losses (diarrhea)

2. Sodium gain
   - Hypertonic saline administration
   - Sodium bicarbonate therapy

3. Inadequate water intake
   - Altered thirst (elderly, impaired consciousness)
   - Limited access to water

**Clinical Manifestations**
- Neurological: Lethargy to coma
- Cell shrinkage, brain hemorrhage risk
- Rapid correction: Cerebral edema risk

| 3% NaCl | 513 | 1026 | Severe hyponatremia |
| 0.45% NaCl | 77 | 154 | Free water with some sodium |

**Fluid Resuscitation in Critical Illness**
