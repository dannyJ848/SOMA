  category: 'pain',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Chest pain can present in many different ways - as sharp stabbing pain, dull pressure, burning, tightness, or aching. The character of the pain often provides clues about its source. Some people describe it as an "elephant sitting on my chest" (classic cardiac), while others feel sharp pain with breathing (often pleural) or burning behind the breastbone (often esophageal).`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Your chest contains several structures that can cause pain: the heart, lungs, esophagus, chest wall muscles and bones, and nerves. Each has different pain receptors and pathways, which is why chest pain can feel so different depending on the cause.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Pain signals from chest structures travel through different pathways. The heart and esophagus share visceral pain fibers through the sympathetic nervous system, which is why cardiac pain and heartburn can feel similar. The chest wall and pleura have somatic pain fibers that localize well. The convergence of visceral afferents from multiple organs at the spinal cord level explains referred pain patterns - why heart attacks can cause arm or jaw pain.`,

    mechanismTypes: [
      {
        type: 'ischemic',
        name: 'Ischemic (Cardiac) Pain',

      {
        type: 'inflammatory',
        name: 'Inflammatory Pain',
        explanation: 'Inflammation releases prostaglandins, bradykinin, and cytokines that sensitize and activate pain receptors.',

        characteristics: ['Poorly localized', 'Patient can\'t point with one finger', 'Associated with visceral symptoms'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Chest pain signals travel through sympathetic afferents (cardiac, esophageal) or intercostal nerves (chest wall, pleura) to dorsal horn neurons in the thoracic spinal cord, then ascend via spinothalamic tracts to the thalamus and sensory cortex.`,

    localizationExplanation: `The ability to localize pain depends on receptor density and pathway specificity. Visceral structures like the heart have sparse, diffuse innervation - explaining why cardiac pain is poorly localized and often felt as pressure or tightness. Somatic structures like the chest wall have dense, specific innervation - making pain sharp and well-localized.`,

    referredPainExplanation: 'Cardiac afferents enter the spinal cord at the same level as somatic afferents from the arm and jaw (T1-T4 and cervical). The brain can\'t distinguish the source, so cardiac ischemia is felt in the arm, jaw, or neck. This is called viscerosomatic convergence.',

  id: 'headache',
  name: 'Headache',
  aliases: ['head pain', 'cephalalgia', 'migraine', 'tension headache'],
  category: 'pain',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Headaches vary tremendously - from dull pressure across the forehead to throbbing one-sided pain to sharp stabbing sensations. The pattern, location, and associated features often tell us what type of headache it is.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Interestingly, your brain itself has no pain receptors. Headache pain comes from surrounding structures - blood vessels, meninges (brain coverings), muscles, and nerves in the head and neck. Different headache types involve different mechanisms.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Primary headaches (migraine, tension, cluster) involve dysfunction of pain-sensing and pain-modulating pathways without structural disease. Migraines involve cortical spreading depression and trigeminovascular activation. Tension headaches involve peripheral and central sensitization of pericranial muscles. Secondary headaches result from underlying conditions affecting pain-sensitive structures.`,

    mechanismTypes: [
      {
        type: 'nociceptive',
        name: 'Meningeal/Vascular',
        explanation: 'The meninges and blood vessels have pain receptors. Stretching, inflammation, or vascular changes activate them.',
        examples: ['Meningitis', 'Subarachnoid hemorrhage', 'Intracranial pressure changes'],
        characteristics: ['Often severe', 'May be worse lying down (high pressure) or standing (low pressure)', 'Associated with neck stiffness if meninges involved'],

      {

      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Pain signals from intracranial structures travel via the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) and upper cervical nerves (C1-C3) to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, then to the thalamus and sensory cortex.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Headache location provides clues but isn't perfect. Frontal headaches often involve the frontal sinus or tension. Temporal headaches may be migraine or temporal arteritis. Occipital headaches often involve cervicogenic causes or occipital neuralgia.`,

  id: 'abdominal-pain',
  name: 'Abdominal Pain',
  aliases: ['stomach ache', 'belly pain', 'tummy pain', 'stomach pain', 'gut pain'],
  category: 'gastrointestinal',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Abdominal pain varies enormously - from dull, crampy discomfort to sharp, stabbing pain. The location, character, and associated symptoms provide crucial clues. Pain can be steady or come in waves (colicky). Some describe it as burning, gnawing, or pressure. The timing relative to meals, bowel movements, and menstrual cycles often points to the cause.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Your abdomen contains many organs - stomach, intestines, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, spleen, and reproductive organs. Pain can come from any of these, from the abdominal wall itself, or can be referred from the chest or spine. The body's way of signaling that something needs attention.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Abdominal pain arises through three pathways: visceral (from organ stretching, inflammation, or ischemia), parietal (from peritoneal irritation - sharp and well-localized), and referred (felt at a distance due to shared nerve pathways). Visceral pain from the gut is typically midline and poorly localized because embryologically, the gut develops in the midline. Parietal peritoneum has somatic innervation - when inflamed, it causes sharp, localizable pain.`,

    mechanismTypes: [
      {
        type: 'inflammatory',
        name: 'Inflammatory Pain',
        explanation: 'Inflammation of organs or peritoneum releases chemical mediators that sensitize pain receptors.',

      },
      {
        type: 'mechanical',
        name: 'Obstructive/Colicky Pain',
        explanation: 'Hollow organ distension or obstruction causes waves of pain as muscles contract against the obstruction.',
        examples: ['Bowel obstruction', 'Kidney stones', 'Gallstones', 'Constipation'],
        characteristics: ['Comes in waves', 'Patient may writhe trying to get comfortable', 'Associated with nausea/vomiting'],
      },
      {
        type: 'ischemic',
        name: 'Ischemic Pain',
        explanation: 'Reduced blood flow to abdominal organs causes pain from tissue oxygen deprivation.',

        characteristics: ['Abdomen may be soft/nontender', 'Other symptoms suggest true source'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Visceral afferents from abdominal organs travel with sympathetic fibers to spinal cord levels T5-L2. The vague, midline quality of visceral pain reflects bilateral innervation and convergence with somatic afferents. Parietal peritoneal pain travels via intercostal and lumbar somatic nerves, explaining its sharp, localizable quality.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Pain location helps identify the source: RUQ (gallbladder, liver, right kidney), epigastric (stomach, pancreas, heart), LUQ (spleen, left kidney), periumbilical (small intestine, appendix early), RLQ (appendix, ovary, cecum), LLQ (sigmoid colon, ovary), suprapubic (bladder, uterus). Midline pain often indicates hollow viscus; lateral pain suggests solid organs or peritoneal involvement.`,

  aliases: ['dyspnea', 'breathlessness', 'difficulty breathing', 'can\'t catch breath', 'air hunger'],
  category: 'respiratory',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Shortness of breath can feel like you can't get enough air, chest tightness with breathing, feeling like you're breathing through a straw, or an uncomfortable awareness of your breathing. Some describe it as air hunger or suffocating. It can come on suddenly or gradually, with exertion or at rest.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Breathing involves getting oxygen in and carbon dioxide out. Shortness of breath occurs when something interferes with this process - problems with the lungs (getting air in), heart (pumping blood to pick up oxygen), blood (carrying oxygen), or the brain's breathing center. Anxiety can also create the sensation of breathlessness.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Dyspnea results from a mismatch between the brain's demand for ventilation and the body's ability to achieve it. Mechanoreceptors in the chest wall, chemoreceptors sensing CO2/O2, and receptors in the lungs all contribute to the sensation. Increased work of breathing (airway obstruction, stiff lungs), gas exchange problems (V/Q mismatch, diffusion impairment), or increased metabolic demand can all cause dyspnea.`,

These converge in the brainstem and are processed in the somatosensory and insular cortices, creating the conscious sensation of breathlessness.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Unlike pain, dyspnea doesn't localize well. However, associated symptoms help identify the source: wheezing suggests airways, pleuritic chest pain suggests pleural involvement, leg swelling suggests cardiac cause, anxiety symptoms suggest psychogenic component.`,

  whatItFeelsLike: `Back pain varies from a dull constant ache to sharp, shooting pain. It can be localized to one spot or spread across the back. Some describe it as stiffness, muscle spasm, or a "catch" with movement. Pain may radiate down the legs (sciatica) if nerves are involved.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Your back is a complex structure of bones (vertebrae), discs (cushions between vertebrae), muscles, ligaments, and nerves. Pain can come from any of these structures. Most back pain is "mechanical" - from muscles, ligaments, or joints. Sometimes it's from disc problems or, rarely, from serious causes.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Back pain arises from nociceptive (tissue damage), neuropathic (nerve injury), or nociplastic (central sensitization) mechanisms. The spine has dense nociceptive innervation in facet joints, periosteum, ligaments, and outer annulus fibrosus of discs. Disc degeneration, facet arthropathy, muscular strain, and ligamentous injury all activate these pain pathways. Radiculopathy occurs when nerve roots are compressed, causing dermatomal pain and neurological deficits.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Spinal structures are innervated by the sinuvertebral nerve (posterior longitudinal ligament, outer annulus) and medial branches of dorsal rami (facet joints, multifidus muscle). Pain signals travel via dorsal root ganglia to the spinal cord, ascending through spinothalamic tracts. Central sensitization can amplify and perpetuate pain even after initial injury heals.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Back pain localization helps identify the source: upper back (thoracic, often muscular or referred from organs), lower back (lumbar, most common), midline (disc, vertebral body), paraspinal (muscles, facets), radiating to leg (nerve root involvement).`,

  name: 'Fatigue',
  aliases: ['tiredness', 'exhaustion', 'lack of energy', 'lethargy', 'weariness'],
  category: 'constitutional',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Fatigue is more than just feeling sleepy - it's a persistent sense of exhaustion, lack of energy, and reduced capacity for physical or mental activity. Some describe it as feeling drained, having no reserves, or like their batteries are empty. It may not improve with rest or sleep.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Your body needs energy for everything it does. Fatigue occurs when energy production or utilization is impaired. This can be from not getting enough sleep, medical conditions affecting energy metabolism, chronic diseases, mental health conditions like depression, or simply doing too much without adequate recovery.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Fatigue involves multiple physiological systems: cellular energy production (mitochondrial function, ATP generation), neurotransmitter balance (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine), hormonal regulation (thyroid, cortisol, testosterone), oxygen delivery (anemia, cardiopulmonary function), and sleep quality. Inflammation (elevated cytokines) can directly cause fatigue, explaining its prominence in chronic diseases and infections.`,

        characteristics: ['Worse with exertion', 'May have dyspnea', 'Physical signs present'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Fatigue perception involves the insula (interoception), prefrontal cortex (effort perception), and limbic system (motivation). Cytokines can cross the blood-brain barrier and directly affect these regions. Sleep deprivation alters neurotransmitter function. The subjective experience of fatigue represents integration of multiple physiological signals.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Fatigue isn't localizable like pain, but associated symptoms help identify the cause: fatigue with dyspnea suggests cardiac/pulmonary; with cold intolerance suggests thyroid; with sadness suggests depression; with excessive sleepiness suggests sleep disorder.`,

  whatItFeelsLike: 'Nausea is the unpleasant sensation that you might vomit - a queasy, unsettled feeling in the stomach often with increased salivation, sweating, and pallor. Vomiting (emesis) is the forceful expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth. Retching ("dry heaves") is the rhythmic contractions without expelling contents.',

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: 'Your brain has a "vomiting center" in the brainstem that receives signals from many sources: the gut, inner ear, emotions, blood chemistry, and medications. When this center is stimulated enough, it triggers the coordinated act of vomiting as a protective mechanism to expel potentially harmful substances.',
    detailedMechanism: 'The vomiting center in the medulla coordinates emesis through inputs from: (1) Chemoreceptor Trigger Zone (CTZ) in area postrema - detects toxins in blood; (2) GI tract via vagus nerve - detects irritation, distension, toxins; (3) Vestibular system - motion sickness; (4) Higher cortical centers - emotions, smells, anticipation.

  aliases: ['pharyngitis', 'throat pain', 'painful swallowing', 'odynophagia'],
  category: 'respiratory',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Sore throat typically presents as pain, scratchiness, or irritation in the throat that worsens with swallowing. It can range from mild discomfort to severe pain making it difficult to eat or drink. Some describe it as feeling like swallowing glass or razor blades (classic strep), while others experience a dull ache or rawness. Associated symptoms often include voice changes, cough, and swollen glands.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Your throat (pharynx) is lined with sensitive mucous membranes rich in pain receptors. When these tissues become inflamed from infection, irritation, or drying, you experience pain especially when swallowing stretches these irritated tissues.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Sore throat results from inflammation of the pharyngeal mucosa, tonsils, and surrounding lymphoid tissue. Viral or bacterial infection triggers immune responses that release inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, bradykinin, cytokines) that sensitize nociceptors in the oropharynx. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) carries pain sensation from most of the throat, while the vagus nerve (CN X) innervates the larynx. Swallowing intensifies pain because it stretches inflamed tissue and increases blood flow to the area.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Pain from the oropharynx travels via the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) to the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem. Laryngeal sensation travels via the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (vagus). These pathways converge with trigeminal input, which explains why ear pain can accompany throat pain (referred via Jacobson's nerve).`,

    localizationExplanation: `Throat pain can be well-localized (pointing to one side suggests peritonsillar abscess) or diffuse. Unilateral pain is more concerning than bilateral. Pain referring to the ear suggests involvement of the glossopharyngeal or vagus nerves (shared otic ganglia connections).`,

  aliases: ['myalgia', 'muscle aches', 'muscle soreness', 'body aches'],
  category: 'musculoskeletal',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Muscle pain varies widely - from the familiar soreness after exercise (delayed onset muscle soreness) to deep aching with viral illness, to sudden cramping, to persistent tender spots. It may be localized to specific muscles or generalized throughout the body. Some describe it as stiffness, heaviness, or weakness along with pain. The quality and distribution provide important clues about the cause.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Muscles contain pain receptors that respond to inflammation, metabolic stress (like lactic acid buildup), direct injury, ischemia (low blood flow), and sustained contraction. When muscle fibers are damaged or inflamed, they release chemicals that activate these receptors, sending pain signals to your brain.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Muscle pain (myalgia) arises from activation of nociceptors in muscle tissue. These receptors respond to multiple stimuli: (1) Inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, bradykinin, substance P) released during tissue damage or infection; (2) Metabolic byproducts (H+, lactate, ATP) during exercise or ischemia; (3) Mechanical stress from trauma or sustained contraction; (4) Systemic cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) during viral illness explaining "body aches." The sensory afferents travel through muscle nerves (group III/IV fibers) to dorsal horn neurons. Sensitization can occur both peripherally (more sensitive receptors) and centrally (amplified spinal cord processing).`,

      {

      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Muscle pain travels via group III (Aδ) and group IV (C) afferent fibers through the muscle nerve to the dorsal root ganglion and into the dorsal horn. Pain signals ascend via the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex. Unlike cutaneous pain, muscle pain is often poorly localized and has a greater affective (emotional suffering) component.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Localized muscle pain (one muscle or muscle group) suggests local pathology - strain, trigger point, or compartment syndrome. Generalized muscle pain (whole body) suggests systemic cause - viral infection, medication side effect, autoimmune disease, or fibromyalgia. The pattern helps guide diagnosis.`,

  id: 'swelling',
  name: 'Swelling',
  aliases: ['edema', 'fluid retention', 'puffiness', 'bloating', 'swollen legs', 'swollen ankles'],
  category: 'constitutional',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Swelling can present as puffiness, tightness, or heaviness in affected areas. Leg swelling often causes shoes to feel tight or leaves sock marks. Facial swelling may be noticed around the eyes, especially in the morning. Some describe it as feeling "bloated" or "waterlogged." The skin may feel stretched, and pressing on it may leave a temporary dent (pitting edema).`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Swelling (edema) occurs when fluid leaks out of blood vessels and accumulates in tissues. This happens when there's increased pressure pushing fluid out, decreased protein pulling fluid back in, blocked drainage (lymphatics), or leaky blood vessel walls. Gravity pulls this fluid to dependent areas like the feet and ankles.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Tissue fluid balance is governed by Starling forces: (1) Capillary hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid out; (2) Plasma oncotic pressure (from albumin) pulls fluid back in; (3) Interstitial pressure and lymphatic drainage remove excess fluid. Edema results from: increased hydrostatic pressure (heart failure, venous obstruction), decreased oncotic pressure (low albumin from liver/kidney disease, malnutrition), increased capillary permeability (inflammation, allergic reactions), or lymphatic obstruction. Distribution depends on the cause - bilateral lower extremity suggests systemic cause; unilateral suggests local obstruction or infection.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Edema itself doesn't directly stimulate pain receptors, but tissue stretch can activate mechanoreceptors causing sensations of tightness, heaviness, and discomfort. If edema causes nerve compression (e.g., carpal tunnel in pregnancy), neuropathic symptoms occur. Inflammatory edema activates nociceptors through inflammatory mediators.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Distribution is the key to diagnosis: Bilateral lower extremity = systemic cause (heart, kidney, liver, venous); Unilateral = local cause (DVT, cellulitis, lymphedema); Facial/periorbital = nephrotic syndrome, angioedema, thyroid; Generalized (anasarca) = severe systemic disease.`,

  name: 'Diarrhea',
  aliases: ['loose stools', 'watery stools', 'frequent bowel movements', 'the runs'],
  category: 'gastrointestinal',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Diarrhea is characterized by loose, watery stools occurring more frequently than usual (typically ≥3 times daily). It may be accompanied by urgency (sudden need to go), cramping, bloating, and abdominal discomfort. Some experience a sense of incomplete evacuation, while others have explosive, uncontrollable stools. The consistency can range from mushy to completely liquid.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Diarrhea occurs when the intestines don't absorb enough water from digested food, or when they secrete extra fluid into the intestinal tract. This can happen from infections that damage the intestinal lining, inflammation, certain foods or medications, or conditions that speed up intestinal transit so there's not enough time to absorb water.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Diarrhea results from one or more mechanisms: (1) Osmotic - unabsorbed solutes (lactose, sorbitol) draw water into the intestinal lumen; (2) Secretory - enterotoxins (cholera, E. coli) or inflammation cause active chloride secretion; (3) Inflammatory - mucosal damage from infection or IBD causes exudation and reduced absorption; (4) Motility-related - rapid transit doesn't allow time for absorption. The intestines normally absorb 99% of the 9 liters of fluid entering daily; even small reduction in absorption causes diarrhea.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Intestinal distension and cramping activate mechanoreceptors and nociceptors in the gut wall. Signals travel via splanchnic and vagal afferents to the spinal cord and brainstem. The urgency sensation results from rectal distension activating pelvic nerve afferents. Inflammatory mediators sensitize these pathways.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Small bowel diarrhea tends to be voluminous and watery without urgency or tenesmus. Large bowel/colonic diarrhea tends to be smaller volume but more frequent, with urgency, tenesmus, and possibly blood/mucus. Location of cramping may suggest involved segment.`,

const CONSTIPATION: SymptomEducation = {
  id: 'constipation',
  name: 'Constipation',
  aliases: ['difficulty passing stool', 'infrequent bowel movements', 'hard stools', 'straining'],
  category: 'gastrointestinal',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Constipation typically involves infrequent, difficult, or incomplete bowel movements.
You may notice hard, dry stools that require straining to pass, a sense that you cannot fully
empty your bowels, abdominal bloating or discomfort, and sometimes pain with defecation.
Some people feel a constant urge to go but cannot produce results, while others may go
days without any urge at all.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Constipation occurs when stool moves too slowly through the colon,
allowing too much water to be absorbed, making stool hard and difficult to pass. This can
happen due to diet, lifestyle, medications, or underlying medical conditions.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Normal colonic transit takes 24-72 hours. The colon absorbs water
and electrolytes from stool as it passes through. When transit is slowed, excessive water
absorption leads to hard, dry stools. Colonic motility is controlled by intrinsic neural
networks (enteric nervous system), extrinsic autonomic nerves, and hormonal signals.
Disruption at any level can cause constipation. Defecation requires coordinated relaxation
of the puborectalis muscle and external anal sphincter with increased intra-abdominal pressure
(Valsalva). Dyssynergia - paradoxical contraction of pelvic floor muscles during defecation -
is a common functional cause.`,

    mechanismTypes: [
      {
        type: 'mechanical',
        name: 'Slow Transit',
        explanation: 'Reduced colonic motility leads to prolonged stool transit time and excess water absorption',

      {
        type: 'mechanical',

        examples: ['Spinal cord injury', 'Multiple sclerosis', 'Parkinson disease'],
        characteristics: ['Associated neurological symptoms', 'May have fecal incontinence too'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Rectal distension activates stretch receptors that signal the urge to
defecate through sacral parasympathetic nerves (S2-S4). The internal anal sphincter relaxes
reflexively (rectoanal inhibitory reflex), and voluntary relaxation of external sphincter
allows passage. Chronic ignoring of defecation urges can desensitize this reflex.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Symptoms can suggest the level of dysfunction. Left-sided
abdominal cramping often indicates colonic involvement, while difficulty evacuating despite
urge suggests outlet obstruction. Systemic symptoms point to secondary causes.`,

  aliases: ['rash', 'skin eruption', 'dermatitis', 'hives', 'spots', 'skin lesions'],
  category: 'dermatological',

  whatItFeelsLike: `A skin rash can present in many ways - as red, raised bumps or welts that
may be itchy (hives/urticaria), flat red patches that may scale or peel, small fluid-filled
blisters, dry scaly patches, or purple/red spots that don't blanch with pressure. The rash
may be localized to one area or spread across the body. Associated sensations can include
itching (pruritus), burning, stinging, tenderness, or no sensation at all.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Rashes occur when the skin reacts to an irritant, allergen, infection,
or internal disease. The immune system releases chemicals that cause blood vessels to dilate
(redness), fluid to leak into tissues (swelling), and nerve stimulation (itching). Different
patterns help identify the underlying cause.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Skin inflammation involves multiple pathways. Type I hypersensitivity
(allergic) involves IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation releasing histamine, causing immediate
urticaria. Type IV delayed hypersensitivity (contact dermatitis) involves T-cell mediated
inflammation appearing 24-72 hours after exposure. Infectious rashes may be from direct pathogen
invasion (fungal, viral), toxin production (scarlet fever, staphylococcal scalded skin), or
immune complex deposition. Autoimmune rashes involve autoantibodies targeting skin components.
Drug reactions can be immediate (anaphylaxis), delayed (morbilliform), or idiosyncratic (SJS/TEN).`,

    sensoryPathway: `Itch (pruritus) is transmitted via unmyelinated C-fibers to the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord, then via the spinothalamic tract to the thalamus and somatosensory
cortex. Histamine, substance P, and cytokines stimulate these fibers. Pain fibers (A-delta)
transmit burning sensations. The itch-scratch cycle can perpetuate inflammation.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Rash distribution provides diagnostic clues. Dermatomal = shingles.
Photodistributed (sun-exposed) = lupus or phototoxic drug reaction. Flexural = atopic dermatitis.
Extensor surfaces = psoriasis. Palms and soles = secondary syphilis, hand-foot-mouth disease.
Mucosal involvement = serious drug reaction (SJS).`,

possibly a dermatoscope (magnifying lens). They will look at the distribution, check for
involvement of mucous membranes (mouth, eyes), and may press on the rash to see if it
blanches. They will ask about new medications, exposures, and associated symptoms. Tests
may include KOH preparation for suspected fungal infection, skin biopsy for unclear cases,

  id: 'anxiety-symptoms',
  name: 'Anxiety Symptoms',
  aliases: ['nervousness', 'worry', 'panic', 'anxious feelings', 'stress', 'feeling on edge'],
  category: 'psychiatric',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Anxiety manifests in both mind and body. Mentally, you may experience
persistent worry, racing thoughts, difficulty concentrating, a sense of impending doom, or
feeling overwhelmed. Physically, anxiety can cause rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath,
chest tightness, sweating, trembling, muscle tension, stomach upset, and restlessness. Some
people describe feeling "on edge" constantly, while others experience intense episodes (panic
attacks) with sudden overwhelming fear and physical symptoms that peak within minutes.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Anxiety is the body's natural response to perceived threat. The "fight
or flight" system activates, releasing stress hormones that prepare the body to face danger.
This is helpful in genuine emergencies but can become problematic when the system activates
too easily, too strongly, or without real threat.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The amygdala processes threat signals and activates the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and autonomic nervous system. The hypothalamus releases CRH,
triggering ACTH release from the pituitary, which stimulates cortisol release from adrenal
glands. Simultaneously, the sympathetic nervous system activates, releasing norepinephrine
and epinephrine. This causes increased heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and
blood flow to muscles. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter that normally dampens
this response. In anxiety disorders, there may be dysregulation of the amygdala, prefrontal
cortex executive control, or neurotransmitter systems (serotonin, norepinephrine, GABA).`,

        examples: ['Phobias', 'PTSD', 'Anxiety from past trauma'],
        characteristics: ['Triggered by specific stimuli or situations'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Sensory input about potential threats travels to the thalamus, which
simultaneously sends information to the amygdala (fast, emotional) and prefrontal cortex
(slower, analytical). The amygdala can trigger fear responses before conscious awareness.
The prefrontal cortex provides executive control and can modulate amygdala activity -
this is why cognitive strategies can help manage anxiety.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Physical symptoms of anxiety often localize to systems controlled
by the autonomic nervous system: cardiovascular (palpitations, chest tightness), respiratory
(shortness of breath, hyperventilation), gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea), and neuromuscular
(tension, tremor). This can make anxiety difficult to distinguish from medical conditions.`,

diagnosis. Assess severity, functional impairment, and safety. Consider comorbid conditions,
especially depression.`,

  id: 'sleep-problems',
  name: 'Sleep Problems',
  aliases: ['insomnia', 'can not sleep', 'trouble sleeping', 'poor sleep', 'sleep difficulties', 'waking up at night'],
  category: 'neurological',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Sleep problems can manifest in several ways: difficulty falling asleep
(lying awake for 30+ minutes), difficulty staying asleep (waking frequently or early), waking
feeling unrefreshed despite enough hours in bed, or excessive daytime sleepiness despite
adequate sleep opportunity. You may feel exhausted during the day, have difficulty concentrating,
feel irritable, or experience mood changes. Some people experience racing thoughts when trying
to sleep, while others simply cannot shut off their mind.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Sleep is regulated by two main systems: the circadian clock (internal
24-hour rhythm) and sleep pressure (the longer you are awake, the sleepier you get). Disruption
of either system, or interference from medical conditions, medications, substances, or psychological
factors, can cause sleep problems.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus is the master circadian
clock, synchronized by light via the retinohypothalamic tract. Melatonin from the pineal gland
promotes sleep onset when light decreases. Adenosine accumulates during waking, creating sleep
pressure that is cleared during sleep. The ascending reticular activating system promotes wakefulness,
while ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) GABA neurons promote sleep. Sleep architecture includes
cycling through NREM stages (N1, N2, N3) and REM sleep in ~90-minute cycles. Disruption can
occur at any of these regulation points.`,

    mechanismTypes: [
      {
        type: 'central',
        name: 'Circadian Disruption',
        explanation: 'Misalignment between internal clock and desired sleep time',

        characteristics: ['Specific symptoms identify disorder', 'Often require sleep study'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Light signals reach the SCN via specialized retinal ganglion cells containing
melanopsin. This inhibits melatonin release and promotes alertness. In darkness, melatonin
is released, facilitating sleep onset. Temperature also plays a role - core body temperature
drops at sleep onset and rises before waking.`,

    localizationExplanation: `The type of sleep problem helps localize the issue. Difficulty
initiating sleep suggests circadian misalignment or hyperarousal. Difficulty maintaining sleep
suggests sleep apnea, pain, or mood disorder. Early morning awakening is classic for depression.
Excessive daytime sleepiness despite adequate sleep suggests sleep apnea or narcolepsy.`,

  category: 'urological',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Urinary symptoms span a wide range of experiences. Dysuria (painful urination)
feels like burning or stinging during urination, often described as "passing razor blades" when severe.
Urgency is a sudden, compelling need to urinate that is difficult to defer - the feeling that you must
go NOW. Frequency means urinating more often than usual, sometimes every 30 minutes to an hour.
Incontinence is involuntary leakage - stress incontinence leaks with coughing, sneezing, or exertion;
urge incontinence is leakage with sudden urges. Retention is the inability to urinate despite feeling
the need, causing pressure and discomfort in the lower abdomen. Hematuria (blood in urine) may be
visible (red or brown urine) or microscopic. Nocturia means waking multiple times at night to urinate.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Urinary symptoms occur when something irritates or obstructs the urinary
tract, or when the nervous system controlling bladder function malfunctions. Infections cause
inflammation that irritates the bladder and urethra. Obstruction (like enlarged prostate) causes
difficulty emptying and frequency. Bladder dysfunction causes urgency and incontinence.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The lower urinary tract has storage and voiding phases, controlled by the
autonomic and somatic nervous systems. During storage, the detrusor muscle relaxes (sympathetic,
beta-3 receptors) while the internal sphincter contracts (sympathetic, alpha-1 receptors). The
external sphincter (somatic, pudendal nerve) provides voluntary control. During voiding, parasympathetic
activation (via muscarinic M3 receptors) contracts the detrusor while sphincters relax.

Dysuria occurs when inflammation sensitizes nociceptors in the bladder and urethral mucosa. UTIs
cause release of inflammatory mediators (prostaglandins, substance P) that lower sensory thresholds.
Interstitial cystitis involves chronic mucosal inflammation with mast cell degranulation.

Urgency results from detrusor overactivity - involuntary contractions during filling - or sensory
urgency from bladder hypersensitivity. The micturition reflex can become hypersensitive from
inflammation, neurological disease, or learned behaviors.

Retention occurs with bladder outlet obstruction (BPH, stricture), detrusor underactivity (diabetes,
anticholinergics), or disrupted coordination (neurological). BPH causes prostatic urethra compression
with high voiding pressures leading to detrusor hypertrophy, then eventual decompensation.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Bladder sensation travels via pelvic nerves (parasympathetic) and hypogastric
nerves (sympathetic) to sacral and thoracolumbar spinal segments. Pain from the bladder is felt
suprapubically. Urethral pain is felt at the meatus. The pudendal nerve provides sensation from
the external sphincter and urethra.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Location and character of symptoms help localize the problem. Dysuria
with suprapubic pain suggests cystitis. Dysuria with flank pain suggests pyelonephritis. Urethral
discharge suggests urethritis. Hesitancy and weak stream suggest obstruction (BPH). Urgency and
frequency without pain suggests overactive bladder. Stress incontinence (leakage with exertion)
suggests sphincter weakness. Urge incontinence suggests detrusor overactivity.`,

    pathwayDescription: `Afferent signals travel via pelvic nerves to S2-S4 (bladder) and via
hypogastric nerves to T11-L2 (pain, fullness). The pontine micturition center (PMC, Barrington's
nucleus) coordinates the switch between storage and voiding. Voluntary control comes from the
frontal cortex inhibiting the PMC until appropriate.`,

    ],

    clinicalRelevance: `Lesions above the pons cause loss of voluntary control but preserved reflexive
voiding (detrusor hyperreflexia). Lesions between the pons and sacral cord cause detrusor-sphincter
dyssynergia (bladder contracts against closed sphincter). Lesions at or below S2-S4 cause areflexic
bladder with retention. Diabetes causes sensory neuropathy first (decreased sensation), then motor
(detrusor underactivity).`,

    referredPainExplanation: `Bladder pain is typically felt suprapubically but can refer to the
perineum, low back, or inner thighs. Ureteral colic radiates from flank to groin following the
course of the ureter. Testicular pathology can cause referred lower abdominal pain.`,

  clinicalReasoning: {
    approachOverview: `Urinary symptoms are approached by categorizing into irritative (storage) vs
obstructive (voiding) symptoms, determining acute vs chronic presentation, and assessing for
complicated features (fever, retention, renal insufficiency). The urinalysis is the initial test
for most presentations. Gender significantly affects the differential - UTI is much more common
in women, while BPH and prostate cancer are male-specific.`,

    differentiationApproach: `First, determine if symptoms are predominantly irritative (storage)
or obstructive (voiding). Irritative symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria) suggest infection,
OAB, or interstitial cystitis. Obstructive symptoms (weak stream, hesitancy, incomplete emptying)
suggest BPH or stricture. Many patients have mixed symptoms. Presence of fever elevates concern
for pyelonephritis or prostatitis. Hematuria, especially painless, requires cancer workup.
In women with uncomplicated cystitis symptoms, empiric treatment without culture is appropriate.
In men, all UTIs are considered complicated and require evaluation.`,

urinalysis. The urinalysis can be done in the office with rapid results. For women with classic
cystitis symptoms, this may be all that's needed before starting treatment. Men and women with
complicated features need urine culture and possibly imaging. Cystoscopy (looking inside the
bladder with a camera) is done for hematuria, recurrent infections, or suspected structural
problems. Urodynamic studies (measuring bladder pressures and function) are done for complex
incontinence or before surgery.`,

  whatItFeelsLike: `Unintentional weight change is noticed when clothes fit differently, when
stepping on a scale shows unexpected numbers, or when others comment on appearance changes.
Weight loss may be accompanied by weakness, fatigue, or muscle wasting. Weight gain may
manifest as tightness of clothing, swelling, or breathlessness. The change may be gradual
or rapid, and may occur with or without appetite changes. Some people lose weight despite
eating well (hyperthyroidism, diabetes, malignancy), while others gain despite eating less
(hypothyroidism, fluid retention).`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Weight change reflects imbalance between energy intake and expenditure,
or changes in body composition (fat, muscle, fluid). Unintentional loss suggests increased
metabolism, decreased absorption, or illness. Unintentional gain suggests decreased
metabolism, fluid retention, or hormonal changes. Many serious conditions alter weight
before causing other obvious symptoms.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Body weight is regulated by complex interactions between the hypothalamus,
adipose tissue (leptin), GI hormones (ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1), and thyroid hormones. The
hypothalamic arcuate nucleus integrates these signals to regulate appetite and metabolism.

Unintentional weight loss occurs through several mechanisms:
1. Hypermetabolism: Increased energy expenditure (hyperthyroidism, malignancy, infection)
2. Malabsorption: Calories consumed but not absorbed (celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency)
3. Cachexia: Inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6) cause muscle wasting despite adequate intake
4. Decreased intake: Anorexia from illness, depression, medications, or GI pathology

Unintentional weight gain occurs through:
1. Hypometabolism: Decreased energy expenditure (hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome)
2. Fluid retention: Heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease, medications
3. Insulin resistance: Promotes fat storage, inhibits lipolysis
4. Medications: Corticosteroids, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants`,

      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Hunger and satiety are regulated by complex neural pathways. Ghrelin from
the stomach stimulates hunger via the vagus nerve and arcuate nucleus. Leptin from adipose
tissue signals satiety. GLP-1 and PYY from the gut signal fullness. These converge on the
hypothalamus to regulate appetite. Illness-associated anorexia involves cytokines acting
directly on hypothalamic appetite centers.`,

    localizationExplanation: `The pattern of weight change provides diagnostic clues. Rapid
weight loss with preserved appetite suggests hypermetabolism (hyperthyroidism) or malabsorption.
Weight loss with decreased appetite suggests systemic illness or depression. Muscle-predominant
wasting suggests cachexia or sarcopenia. Central adiposity with thin extremities suggests
Cushing syndrome. Dependent edema with weight gain suggests fluid retention.`,

  clinicalReasoning: {
    approachOverview: `Unintentional weight change requires systematic evaluation. First, verify
the weight change is real and quantify it. Then categorize by direction (loss vs gain) and
presence of appetite changes. Weight loss with increased appetite suggests hypermetabolic states.
Weight loss with decreased appetite suggests systemic illness. Consider patient age and risk
factors - older adults with weight loss need malignancy evaluation. Start with basic labs
(CBC, CMP, TSH, glucose, HIV) and expand based on clinical suspicion.`,

change (objective measurement), detailed history about appetite and associated symptoms, and
physical examination. Initial labs typically include thyroid function, blood sugar, complete
blood count, kidney and liver function, and possibly inflammatory markers. Further testing
depends on initial findings and suspicion - this may include imaging, cancer screening tests,
or specialist referral. Be prepared for a stepwise workup that may take several visits.`,

  category: 'sensory',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Vision changes vary widely in character. Blurry vision feels like looking
through a dirty window or fog. Floaters appear as dark spots, cobwebs, or strings drifting
across vision, especially noticeable against bright backgrounds. Flashing lights are brief
sparkles or lightning streaks, often in peripheral vision. Double vision (diplopia) means
seeing two images of a single object. Visual field loss may be a curtain coming down (retinal
detachment), a shadow or blind area (stroke), or tunnel vision (glaucoma). Central vision loss
makes reading difficult while peripheral vision is preserved. Complete sudden blindness in
one eye is terrifying and often painless (retinal artery occlusion) or painful (acute glaucoma).`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Vision requires a clear optical pathway (cornea, lens, vitreous),
a functioning retina to detect light, an intact optic nerve to transmit signals, and
working brain visual centers to process images. Problems at any level cause vision changes.
Refractive errors blur vision; cataracts cloud the lens; retinal problems cause floaters,
flashes, or field loss; optic nerve disease causes vision loss; brain lesions cause
specific visual field defects.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Light enters through the cornea, is focused by the lens onto the retina,
where photoreceptors (rods for peripheral/night vision, cones for central/color vision) convert
light to electrical signals. These signals travel via retinal ganglion cells, form the optic
nerve, cross partially at the chiasm, continue as optic tracts to the lateral geniculate nucleus,
and then to the primary visual cortex (V1) in the occipital lobe.

Refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism) occur when light doesn't focus precisely on
the retina. Cataracts scatter light through the opacified lens. Macular degeneration destroys
central photoreceptors. Retinal detachment separates the retina from its blood supply. Vitreous
floaters are debris casting shadows on the retina. Optic neuritis inflames the optic nerve
(often in MS). Vascular occlusions (retinal artery, vein) cause sudden ischemic damage.
Stroke affecting the visual pathway causes characteristic field defects (homonymous hemianopia).`,

      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Photoreceptors in the retina convert light to electrical signals. These
signals are processed by bipolar and ganglion cells, forming the optic nerve. At the optic
chiasm, nasal fibers cross, so each brain hemisphere receives information from the opposite
visual field. The lateral geniculate nucleus relays signals to the primary visual cortex.
Damage at different levels produces predictable visual field defects - understanding this
anatomy helps localize lesions.`,

    localizationExplanation: `The pattern of vision loss indicates where the problem is.
Monocular vision loss = eye or optic nerve (before chiasm). Bitemporal hemianopia = chiasm
(pituitary tumor). Homonymous hemianopia = post-chiasmal (stroke). Central scotoma =
macula or optic nerve. Tunnel vision = glaucoma (peripheral field loss). Floaters/flashes
= vitreous or retina. Diplopia = cranial nerves (3, 4, 6) or brain stem.`,

  clinicalReasoning: {
    approachOverview: `Vision changes require rapid triage based on onset and associated symptoms.
Sudden vision loss is emergent until proven otherwise - consider CRAO, retinal detachment,
acute glaucoma, GCA. Pain distinguishes some conditions: acute glaucoma is painful, CRAO is
painless. Age matters: GCA is over 50, optic neuritis is young adults. Monocular vs binocular
localizes the lesion. Always ask about floaters, flashes, pain, headache, and associated
neurological symptoms.`,

tomography (OCT, a detailed retinal scan), or fluorescein angiography (dye test) may be needed.

  ],
  category: 'motor',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Weakness is the actual loss of muscle strength - the inability
to move or exert force normally. It's different from fatigue (feeling tired) or
lethargy. True weakness means you physically cannot do something you used to be
able to do - like lift your arm, climb stairs, or grip objects. The pattern of
weakness - whether it affects one side, both legs, just proximal muscles, or
fluctuates throughout the day - provides crucial diagnostic information. Weakness
can range from mild (trouble opening jars) to complete paralysis.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Weakness occurs when there's a problem somewhere along
the pathway from your brain to your muscles. This pathway includes the brain
(motor cortex), spinal cord, nerves, neuromuscular junction (where nerves
meet muscles), or the muscles themselves. A problem at any of these points
causes weakness, but with characteristic patterns that help identify the level.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The motor system is a chain: upper motor neurons in
the brain send signals down the spinal cord to lower motor neurons, which
send signals through peripheral nerves to the neuromuscular junction, where
acetylcholine triggers muscle contraction. Upper motor neuron lesions (brain/
spinal cord) cause spastic weakness with increased reflexes. Lower motor neuron
lesions (anterior horn, nerve roots, peripheral nerves) cause flaccid weakness
with decreased reflexes and muscle atrophy. Neuromuscular junction problems
cause fatigable weakness. Muscle diseases cause proximal weakness affecting
large muscle groups.`,

      {

      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Weakness itself involves motor pathways only, but associated
sensory symptoms help localize the problem. Pure motor weakness without sensory
loss suggests motor neuron disease, myopathy, or neuromuscular junction disease.
Weakness with sensory loss suggests nerve or spinal cord involvement.`,

    localizationExplanation: `The pattern of weakness is diagnostic: hemiparesis
(one side) = brain lesion; paraparesis (both legs) = spinal cord; ascending
weakness = Guillain-Barré; proximal weakness = myopathy; fatigable weakness =
neuromuscular junction; distal weakness = peripheral neuropathy. The distribution
maps to the anatomy of the motor system.`,

Is this upper motor neuron (brain/spinal cord) or lower motor neuron (nerve/
muscle)? The exam distinguishes these by tone, reflexes, and pattern of weakness.

(degenerative). Distribution narrows further: hemiparesis (brain), paraparesis

of strength) vs fatigue or pain-limited. Then localize: UMN signs (spasticity,
hyperreflexia, Babinski) = brain or spinal cord; LMN signs (flaccidity,
hyporeflexia, atrophy) = anterior horn, nerve, or muscle. Combined UMN + LMN =
ALS. Fatigable weakness = neuromuscular junction. Proximal > distal = myopathy.

  whatItFeelsLike: `Tremor is an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillating movement of a
body part - most commonly the hands. It can range from barely noticeable to
severely disabling. The key is understanding when the tremor occurs: at rest
(hands in lap), with action (reaching for something), or when maintaining a
posture (holding arms out). This distinction is crucial for diagnosis. Some
tremors worsen with stress, caffeine, or fatigue. Tremor can affect hands,
head, voice, or even the whole body.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Tremor occurs when there's an imbalance in the brain
circuits that control movement. The cerebellum, basal ganglia, and motor cortex
normally work together to produce smooth movement. When these circuits are
disrupted - by degeneration, medication, metabolic problems, or anxiety - the
result is rhythmic, involuntary shaking.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Normal movement requires coordinated activity between
the motor cortex (initiates movement), basal ganglia (modulates movement,
especially amplitude and timing), and cerebellum (fine-tunes coordination and
timing). Rest tremor, as in Parkinson's disease, results from dopamine depletion
in the substantia nigra, disinhibiting the basal ganglia output. Action/postural
tremor, as in essential tremor, involves oscillations in the cerebello-thalamo-
cortical circuit. Physiological tremor is enhanced by catecholamine excess.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Tremor is primarily a motor phenomenon, but sensory feedback
plays a role in tremor amplification. Proprioceptive input helps modulate tremor
amplitude. In some cases, sensory tricks can temporarily suppress tremor.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Rest tremor (present when limb is supported,
decreases with action) = basal ganglia (Parkinson's). Action/postural tremor
(present when moving or holding position) = cerebellum or enhanced physiological
tremor. Intention tremor (worsens as approaching target) = cerebellum. The
frequency and associated features help narrow the diagnosis.`,

isolated tremor suggests essential tremor; tremor plus bradykinesia/rigidity

  ],
  category: 'sensory',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Hearing loss can be gradual (taking years to notice) or sudden
(waking up deaf in one ear). Gradual loss often presents as difficulty hearing
in noisy environments, needing to turn up the TV, or frequently asking people
to repeat themselves. Sudden hearing loss feels like the ear is blocked or
"stuffed" and is usually noticeable immediately. The loss may be accompanied
by tinnitus (ringing), ear pain, or dizziness. Understanding the type and
pattern of hearing loss guides diagnosis and treatment.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Hearing loss occurs when sound signals can't travel
properly from the outer ear to the brain. This can happen at any point: a
blocked ear canal (conductive), damaged hair cells in the inner ear (sensorineural),
or problems with the hearing nerve. The most common cause is age-related wear
on inner ear hair cells, but there are many other causes ranging from earwax
to tumors.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Sound waves travel through the ear canal, vibrate the
eardrum, pass through the ossicles (tiny bones), and enter the cochlea where
hair cells convert vibrations to nerve signals. Conductive hearing loss occurs
when mechanical transmission is blocked (wax, fluid, ossicle fixation).
Sensorineural loss occurs when hair cells or the auditory nerve are damaged
(age, noise, medications, tumors). Mixed hearing loss involves both components.`,

      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Sound waves enter the ear canal, vibrate the tympanic membrane,
transmit through ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes), create waves in cochlear
fluid, stimulate hair cells which release neurotransmitter onto auditory nerve
fibers. Signals travel via the cochlear nerve to cochlear nuclei, then to
inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Conductive loss: problem is outer ear canal, tympanic
membrane, or middle ear. Sensorineural loss: problem is cochlea (most common)
or auditory nerve. The Weber and Rinne tests help distinguish these. Unilateral
sensorineural loss is more concerning for retrocochlear pathology (acoustic neuroma).`,

  clinicalReasoning: {
    approachOverview: `The approach to hearing loss starts with determining if it's
conductive or sensorineural (tuning fork tests, audiometry). Then assess tempo:
sudden SNHL is an emergency requiring urgent steroids. For gradual loss, determine
unilateral vs bilateral. Any unilateral SNHL needs MRI to rule out acoustic
neuroma. Bilateral symmetric SNHL in older adults is usually presbycusis.`,

problems before the patient does, which itself can be a concerning sign.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Memory involves multiple brain systems working together:
encoding (taking in new information), storage (retaining it), and retrieval
(accessing it later). Memory problems occur when any of these processes is
disrupted. This can happen from neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer's),
vascular disease, reversible causes (medications, depression, thyroid), or
normal aging in mild forms.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Memory formation requires the hippocampus (medial temporal
lobe) for encoding and consolidation. Long-term storage involves distributed
cortical networks. Working memory relies on prefrontal cortex. Alzheimer's
disease affects the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex first (amyloid plaques,
neurofibrillary tangles), causing anterograde amnesia. Vascular dementia results
from cerebrovascular disease disrupting memory circuits. Delirium causes acute
global cognitive dysfunction from metabolic/toxic/infectious causes.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Memory is not a single process but involves attention
(prefrontal), encoding (hippocampus), consolidation (hippocampus to cortex
during sleep), storage (distributed cortex), and retrieval (prefrontal).
Disruption at any level affects memory, but the pattern differs: hippocampal
damage causes inability to form new memories; retrieval problems may respond
to cues.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Hippocampal damage (Alzheimer's) causes anterograde
amnesia - can't form new memories. Frontal lobe dysfunction causes executive
dysfunction and retrieval problems. Diffuse cortical disease causes global
cognitive decline. The pattern of cognitive deficits helps distinguish
different dementia subtypes.`,

  id: 'difficulty-swallowing',
  name: 'Difficulty Swallowing',
  aliases: ['dysphagia', 'trouble swallowing', 'food getting stuck', 'choking on food', 'swallowing problems'],
  category: 'gastrointestinal',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Difficulty swallowing ranges from a mild sensation of food "sticking" in the throat
or chest to complete inability to swallow solids, liquids, or even saliva. You may feel:
- Food getting stuck in throat or chest
- Needing extra effort to swallow
- Coughing or choking when eating
- Regurgitation of food
- Pain when swallowing (odynophagia)
- Sensation of a lump in the throat (globus)
- Drooling or excessive saliva`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Swallowing is a complex coordinated process involving your mouth, throat, esophagus,
and brain. Problems anywhere along this pathway - from weak muscles to blockages to nerve damage -
can make swallowing difficult.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Swallowing has three phases:
1. ORAL PHASE: Tongue pushes food bolus to back of throat
2. PHARYNGEAL PHASE: Soft palate closes nasal passage, epiglottis closes airway, pharyngeal muscles
   propel bolus past the upper esophageal sphincter (reflexive, coordinated by brainstem)
3. ESOPHAGEAL PHASE: Peristaltic waves move bolus down esophagus, lower esophageal sphincter relaxes

Dysphagia is classified as:
- OROPHARYNGEAL: Problem initiating swallow, getting food into esophagus (neurologic, muscular)
- ESOPHAGEAL: Problem after swallow initiated, food sticking in chest (mechanical, motility)

Causes include structural obstruction (narrowing, tumors), motility disorders (weak or uncoordinated
muscles), and neurological conditions affecting swallowing centers or nerves.`,

    mechanismTypes: [
      {

        characteristics: ['Solids AND liquids affected', 'Variable symptoms', 'Chest pain'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Swallowing involves cranial nerves V (trigeminal - sensation), VII (facial - taste),
IX (glossopharyngeal - pharynx), X (vagus - esophagus), and XII (hypoglossal - tongue movement).
The swallowing center in the medulla coordinates the reflex. Sensory feedback from the pharynx and
esophagus travels via vagus to brainstem.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Where food seems to stick helps localize:
- "Throat/neck" level: Often oropharyngeal (pharynx, upper esophagus)
- "Chest" level: Usually esophageal (mid or lower esophagus)
- Note: Patient localization can be off by several vertebral levels`,

    pathwayDescription: `Sensory information from pharynx/esophagus travels via cranial nerves IX and X
to the nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla. The "swallowing center" (central pattern generator)
coordinates the sequential motor response via nucleus ambiguus. Motor output goes to pharyngeal
constrictors and esophagus via vagus nerve.`,

directly at the esophagus and take biopsies. If the cause isn't clear, you may need additional

evaluates swallowing safety.`,

const BLOATING: SymptomEducation = {
  id: 'bloating',
  name: 'Bloating',
  aliases: ['abdominal bloating', 'belly distension', 'feeling bloated', 'gas', 'distension', 'swollen belly'],
  category: 'gastrointestinal',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Bloating is a sensation of abdominal fullness, pressure, or tightness - like your
belly is swollen or overfull. You may experience:
- Feeling of abdominal pressure or fullness
- Visible swelling of the abdomen (distension)
- Tightness of clothing around waist
- Need to loosen belt after eating
- Excessive gas (belching or flatulence)
- Discomfort relieved by passing gas
- Fluctuation throughout the day (often worse by evening)`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Bloating occurs when gas, fluid, or contents accumulate in your intestines,
or when your gut is hypersensitive to normal amounts of gas. It can also result from actual
abdominal distension from fluid (ascites), masses, or organ enlargement.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Bloating has two components:
1. SUBJECTIVE BLOATING: The sensation of fullness/distension - may occur without visible swelling,
   often due to visceral hypersensitivity (gut nerves overreacting to normal distension)
2. OBJECTIVE DISTENSION: Actual measurable increase in abdominal girth - from gas, fluid, or mass

GAS-RELATED bloating:
- Swallowed air (aerophagia) during eating, drinking, anxiety
- Bacterial fermentation of undigested carbohydrates in colon
- Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
- Food intolerances (lactose, fructose, FODMAPs)

NON-GAS distension:
- Ascites (fluid accumulation - liver disease, heart failure, cancer)
- Constipation with stool accumulation
- Masses (tumors, organomegaly)
- Functional abdominal distension (gut-brain interaction)`,

        characteristics: ['Diarrhea common', 'Other GI symptoms', 'Responds to treating underlying cause'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Distension is sensed by stretch receptors (mechanoreceptors) in the gut wall.
Signals travel via vagus nerve and spinal afferents to the brainstem and brain. In visceral
hypersensitivity, these pathways are sensitized, causing normal distension to feel uncomfortable.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Bloating is often felt diffusely but may localize:
- Upper abdomen: Gastric distension, gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia
- Lower/central: Colonic gas, constipation, IBS
- Diffuse: Ascites, widespread functional bloating`,

  name: 'Itching',
  aliases: ['pruritus', 'itchy skin', 'itch', 'scratching', 'skin irritation'],
  category: 'dermatological',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Itching is an unpleasant sensation that creates an urge to scratch. It ranges from
mild annoyance to unbearable, sleep-disrupting misery. You may experience:
- Localized or widespread itching
- Urge to scratch that provides temporary relief
- Skin that may or may not have visible changes
- Worse at night (nocturnal pruritus)
- Crawling, burning, or tingling sensations
- Secondary skin damage from scratching (excoriations)`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Itching occurs when certain substances or signals activate itch receptors in
your skin. This can happen from skin conditions, allergies, systemic diseases, or nerve problems.
Sometimes the skin looks normal but still itches intensely.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Pruritus involves specialized itch neurons (pruriceptors) in the skin that
are distinct from pain receptors. Key mediators include:

HISTAMINE-MEDIATED: Mast cell release of histamine activates H1 receptors - classic allergic itch
NON-HISTAMINERGIC: Many itch mediators don't respond to antihistamines:
- Proteases (PAR-2 receptors)
- Cytokines (IL-31, especially in atopic dermatitis)
- Bile acids (cholestatic pruritus)
- Opioid peptides (uremic, cholestatic pruritus)
- Neuropeptides (substance P)

NEUROPATHIC ITCH: Nerve damage causes itch without skin pathology (postherpetic, brachioradial)

Itch signals travel via C-fibers to dorsal horn, then spinothalamic tract to thalamus and
somatosensory cortex. The scratch reflex is spinal but modulated by higher centers.

Itch-scratch cycle: Scratching damages skin → inflammation → more itch → more scratching`,

      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Pruriceptors are unmyelinated C-fibers in the epidermis. Signals synapse in
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (distinct from pain neurons). Ascending fibers travel in the
spinothalamic tract to the thalamus, then to primary somatosensory cortex. The brain regions
for itch overlap with those for pain and emotional processing.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Distribution pattern is diagnostically important:
- Generalized: Systemic cause (liver, kidney, thyroid, lymphoma)
- Dermatomal: Neuropathic (shingles distribution)
- Flexural: Atopic dermatitis
- Scalp: Seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lice
- Localized patches: Contact dermatitis, lichen simplex`,

  id: 'seizures',
  name: 'Seizures',
  aliases: ['convulsions', 'fits', 'epileptic episode', 'convulsion', 'epilepsy'],
  category: 'neurological',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Seizures can manifest in many ways depending on the type:
- GENERALIZED TONIC-CLONIC: Sudden loss of consciousness, body stiffening, rhythmic jerking,
  followed by confusion. May bite tongue, lose bladder control.
- FOCAL (PARTIAL): May retain awareness. Unusual sensations, involuntary movements of one body part,
  strange feelings, déjà vu, fear, or automatisms (lip smacking, hand movements).
- ABSENCE: Brief staring spells, unresponsive for seconds, then resuming activity normally.
- After a seizure (postictal): Confusion, fatigue, headache, muscle soreness, memory gap.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `A seizure occurs when nerve cells in the brain fire abnormally and
excessively. This can happen because of an imbalance in brain chemistry, structural brain
abnormalities, or triggers like low blood sugar, medications, or sleep deprivation.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Seizures result from abnormal, hypersynchronous neuronal activity. Normal
brain function requires balance between excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) signals.

SEIZURE GENERATION:
1. Neurons become hyperexcitable (ion channel dysfunction, neurotransmitter imbalance)
2. Paroxysmal depolarization shift (PDS) - sustained depolarization in a group of neurons
3. Synchronization spreads to connected neurons
4. If spread is limited → focal seizure. If generalizes → generalized seizure

CAUSES OF NEURONAL HYPEREXCITABILITY:
- Genetic: Ion channel mutations (channelopathies), inherited epilepsy syndromes
- Structural: Tumors, stroke, trauma, malformations, hippocampal sclerosis
- Metabolic: Hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, uremia, hepatic failure
- Toxic: Alcohol withdrawal, drugs, medications
- Infectious: Meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess
- Idiopathic: No identifiable cause (many epilepsies)

Epilepsy = recurrent unprovoked seizures (at least 2, or 1 with high recurrence risk)`,

    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Seizure activity originates in neuronal networks. The seizure onset zone determines
initial symptoms (motor cortex → movement; temporal lobe → déjà vu, fear, automatisms). Spread to
thalamus and brainstem causes loss of consciousness. Spread to motor cortex bilaterally causes
tonic-clonic activity. Postictal state reflects neuronal exhaustion and transient dysfunction.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Seizure semiology (appearance) localizes the onset zone:
- Temporal lobe: Aura (déjà vu, fear, smell), automatisms, impaired awareness
- Frontal lobe: Brief, bizarre movements, minimal postictal confusion
- Parietal lobe: Sensory symptoms (tingling, numbness)
- Occipital lobe: Visual phenomena (lights, colors)
- Generalized: No focal onset, affects whole brain simultaneously`,

  category: 'psychiatric',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Depression is more than just feeling sad - it's a persistent state that affects
how you think, feel, and function. Common experiences include:
- Persistent sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness
- Loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy
- Fatigue and low energy even without physical activity
- Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, or remembering
- Sleep changes - insomnia or sleeping too much
- Appetite changes - eating too little or too much
- Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
- Physical symptoms - aches, pains, digestive problems
- Thoughts of death or suicide`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Depression results from a complex interplay of brain chemistry, genetics,
life events, and physical health. It's not a character flaw or weakness - it's a medical
condition involving changes in brain function and neurotransmitter systems.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Depression involves multiple neurobiological mechanisms:

MONOAMINE HYPOTHESIS: Reduced serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine signaling
- Supported by effectiveness of antidepressants that increase these neurotransmitters
- However, this is an oversimplification - antidepressants work faster than symptom improvement

NEUROPLASTICITY: Reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and hippocampal volume
- Chronic stress reduces neuroplasticity
- Antidepressants and ketamine may work partly by increasing BDNF

INFLAMMATION: Elevated inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-alpha, CRP) in many depressed patients
- Inflammation affects neurotransmitter metabolism
- Explains link between depression and chronic medical conditions

HPA AXIS DYSREGULATION: Overactive stress response, elevated cortisol
- Chronic stress sensitizes the system
- Affects hippocampus and prefrontal cortex function

CIRCUIT DYSFUNCTION:
- Overactive amygdala (emotional processing)
- Underactive prefrontal cortex (emotional regulation)
- Altered connectivity in default mode network`,

  whatItFeelsLike: `Rectal bleeding can appear in several ways: bright red blood on toilet paper
after wiping, blood dripping into the toilet bowl, blood mixed into the stool, or dark/black
tarry stools with a distinctive smell. Some people notice blood only occasionally, while others
see it with every bowel movement. There may be associated symptoms like pain during bowel
movements, itching, a lump near the anus, abdominal pain, or changes in bowel habits. The
amount can range from a few drops to significant bleeding that causes lightheadedness.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Blood in the stool comes from somewhere along the digestive tract - from
the esophagus to the rectum. Bright red blood typically comes from the lower digestive tract
(colon, rectum, or anus), while dark/black blood usually comes from higher up (stomach or
small intestine). Common causes include hemorrhoids, anal fissures, polyps, and inflammatory
bowel disease. Less commonly, it can indicate colorectal cancer.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The color and appearance of blood in stool reflects its source and transit
time. Bright red blood (hematochezia) comes from the lower GI tract where blood has little time
to be degraded. Dark red or maroon blood suggests mid-GI or right colon sources. Black, tarry
stool (melena) indicates upper GI bleeding where hemoglobin is converted to hematin by gastric
acid. Mechanisms of bleeding include: (1) vascular abnormalities (hemorrhoids, angiodysplasia),
(2) mucosal injury (fissures, ulcers, inflammation), (3) mass lesions (polyps, cancers), and
(4) coagulation disorders. The GI tract's rich blood supply means even small lesions can bleed
significantly.`,

    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Pain from anal sources involves the inferior rectal nerve (pudendal nerve branch)
providing sharp, well-localized sensation below the dentate line. Above the dentate line, visceral
afferents provide poorly localized sensation. Blood itself is not felt but may be noticed during
wiping, in the toilet, or mixed with stool.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Source localization depends on blood color and associated symptoms. Bright
red blood coating stool or on paper suggests an anal source. Blood mixed into stool suggests a
colonic source. Dark or black stool indicates upper GI or right colon. Associated symptoms help
localize: pain with defecation suggests fissure or hemorrhoid, painless suggests polyp or cancer.`,

    pathwayDescription: `Somatic pain from the anal canal travels via pudendal nerve to S2-S4
spinal segments. Visceral sensation from the colon travels via pelvic splanchnic nerves and
inferior mesenteric plexus to T10-L2 segments.`,

    processingCenters: ['Spinal cord dorsal horn', 'Thalamus', 'Somatosensory cortex', 'Limbic system'],

    clinicalRelevance: `The sharp demarcation of sensation at the dentate line explains why internal
hemorrhoids can grow large without pain, while anal fissures cause severe pain. This also affects
treatment choices - procedures on internal hemorrhoids are often painless.`,

and associated symptoms. The key questions are: (1) Is this an emergency? (2) Where is the blood
coming from? (3) Is this a benign or potentially serious cause? All adults over 45 with new rectal
bleeding should have colonoscopy regardless of apparent hemorrhoid etiology.`,

  ],
  category: 'dermatological',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Hair loss can manifest in many ways: gradually thinning hair on the top of
the head, circular or patchy bald spots, sudden loosening and shedding of hair, full-body hair
loss, or patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. Some people first notice more hair in
their brush or shower drain. Hair loss may be temporary or permanent, and may affect just your
scalp or your entire body. While more common in men, women also experience significant hair loss.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Hair grows in cycles - each follicle grows hair for several years (anagen phase),
then rests and sheds (telogen phase). Hair loss occurs when this cycle is disrupted, hair follicles
are damaged, or follicles shrink over time. Common causes include genetics (pattern baldness),
hormonal changes, medical conditions, nutritional deficiencies, and stress.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Hair follicles undergo repetitive cycles: anagen (active growth, 2-7 years),
catagen (transition, 2-3 weeks), and telogen (resting/shedding, 2-3 months). Normal daily shedding
is 50-100 hairs. Pathological hair loss results from: (1) Miniaturization - DHT-sensitive follicles
shrink (androgenetic alopecia); (2) Immune attack - T-cells attack follicles (alopecia areata);
(3) Scarring - destruction of follicles by inflammation (cicatricial alopecia); (4) Premature
telogen entry - stress/illness shifts many follicles to telogen simultaneously (telogen effluvium);
(5) Mechanical/chemical damage - physical trauma to hair/follicles (traction alopecia); (6)
Nutritional deficiency - inadequate building blocks for hair growth.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Hair loss itself is typically painless. However, some inflammatory conditions
cause scalp tenderness, burning, or itching via free nerve endings in the scalp. The psychological
impact of hair loss often causes significant emotional distress.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Distribution pattern is key to diagnosis. Crown and temple thinning
suggests androgenetic alopecia. Smooth round patches suggest alopecia areata. Scarring patches
suggest cicatricial alopecia. Frontal thinning in women suggests female pattern hair loss.
Marginal/hairline loss suggests traction alopecia.`,

  whatItFeelsLike: `Eye pain can vary from a dull ache to sharp, stabbing pain. It may feel like
pressure behind the eye, a scratchy or gritty sensation on the surface, burning, throbbing, or
stabbing pain. The pain may worsen with eye movement, light exposure, or touch. Some conditions
cause deep orbital pain while others cause surface discomfort. Pain may be constant or intermittent,
and may be accompanied by redness, tearing, vision changes, or sensitivity to light.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Eye pain occurs when pain-sensing nerves in the eye or surrounding structures
are stimulated. The eye surface (cornea and conjunctiva) is extremely sensitive and even minor
irritation causes significant pain. Deeper structures like the uvea or optic nerve can also cause
pain. Increased eye pressure, inflammation, infection, and injury are common causes.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The cornea is the most densely innervated tissue in the body - about 300-600
times more sensitive than skin. Nociceptive signals travel via the ophthalmic branch of the
trigeminal nerve (V1). Surface pain typically involves epithelial damage or inflammation activating
corneal nociceptors. Deep orbital pain involves inflammation or pressure affecting uveal tissue,
sclera, or orbital structures. Referred pain can come from sinuses, teeth, or intracranial pathology.
Angle-closure glaucoma causes pain through rapid IOP elevation stretching the cornea and iris.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Corneal and conjunctival sensation travels via the nasociliary nerve (branch of
ophthalmic V1). Deep orbital pain via ophthalmic and maxillary divisions. Signals travel to the
trigeminal ganglion, then to the spinal trigeminal nucleus, thalamus, and sensory cortex.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Surface pain suggests corneal or conjunctival pathology. Deep aching
pain suggests uveal, scleral, or orbital disease. Pain worse with movement suggests optic neuritis
or myositis. Periorbital pain may indicate orbital or sinus disease. Pain with headache suggests
primary headache disorder or intracranial pathology.`,

  category: 'sensory',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Ear pain can range from a dull ache to sharp, stabbing pain. It may feel like
pressure or fullness in the ear. The pain can be constant or come and go. It may worsen when
chewing, yawning, or pulling on the ear. In some cases, the ear may feel blocked or have
reduced hearing. The pain can be in one or both ears and may be accompanied by drainage,
ringing, or fever.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Ear pain can come from problems in the ear itself (primary otalgia) or from
problems in nearby structures that share nerves with the ear (referred otalgia). The ear has
a rich nerve supply making it very sensitive. Infections are the most common cause in children,
while referred pain from the jaw or throat is more common in adults without ear abnormalities.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The ear receives sensory innervation from multiple cranial nerves: trigeminal
(V), facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), vagus (X), and cervical nerves (C2-C3). This shared
innervation means pain from the teeth, jaw (TMJ), throat, sinuses, or even heart can be felt in
the ear. Primary otalgia results from inflammation, infection, or pressure changes affecting the
external or middle ear. The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx - dysfunction
causes pressure pain. Acute otitis media causes pain from inflammatory pressure on the tympanic
membrane, which is exquisitely pain-sensitive.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Multiple nerves supply the ear: auriculotemporal nerve (V3) supplies outer ear
and canal; lesser occipital (C2-C3) supplies posterior ear; Arnold's nerve (X) supplies canal;
Jacobson's nerve (IX) supplies middle ear. These converge at trigeminal nucleus and upper cervical
cord, explaining referred pain patterns.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Pain location helps identify source: pain worsening with ear manipulation
suggests external ear; deep pain with hearing loss suggests middle ear; pain with chewing suggests
TMJ; pain with swallowing suggests throat origin.`,

    approachOverview: `The key branch point in ear pain is whether the ear exam is normal. If abnormal,
the cause is usually in the ear. If normal, think referred pain from teeth, TMJ, throat, or rarely
cancer. In children, primary ear disease is most common. In adults with normal ears, referred
pain is frequent. Always examine the ear, throat, teeth, TMJ, and neck.`,

  ],
  category: 'constitutional',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Night sweats are episodes of excessive sweating during sleep that may soak
through nightclothes and bedding. They're more than just feeling warm - the sweating is severe
enough to drench sleepwear and sheets, often requiring changing. You may wake up cold and clammy.
Episodes can occur nightly or intermittently. Night sweats differ from simply being too warm due
to a hot room or too many blankets.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Night sweats occur when the body's temperature regulation system causes
excessive sweating. This can happen from infections (the body fights infection by raising
temperature), hormonal changes (menopause, thyroid problems), medications, or rarely, serious
conditions like cancer. The autonomic nervous system controls sweating, and anything that
affects it can cause night sweats.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Thermoregulation is controlled by the hypothalamus. When core body temperature
rises, eccrine sweat glands are activated via sympathetic cholinergic fibers. Night sweats result
from: (1) Infectious causes - pyrogens reset the hypothalamic set point, then as fever breaks,
sweating occurs to dissipate heat; (2) Hormonal - estrogen withdrawal in menopause destabilizes
thermoregulation; (3) Malignancy - cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF) cause fever and sweating;
(4) Medications - many drugs affect sympathetic/cholinergic systems; (5) Autonomic dysfunction -
conditions affecting the autonomic nervous system can dysregulate sweating.`,

        characteristics: ['May affect daytime too', 'Other autonomic symptoms'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Sweating is controlled by sympathetic cholinergic fibers. Temperature sensors in
the skin and core send signals to the hypothalamus, which activates sweat glands when cooling is
needed. This system can be activated by pyrogens, hormones, or medications.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Night sweats are typically generalized. Localized sweating suggests
different pathology. The drenching nature and sleep disruption distinguish pathological night
sweats from simple overheating.`,

const EXCESSIVE_THIRST: SymptomEducation = {
  id: 'excessive-thirst',
  name: 'Excessive Thirst',
  aliases: ['polydipsia', 'increased thirst', 'always thirsty', 'drinking too much', 'unquenchable thirst'],
  category: 'constitutional',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Excessive thirst is a persistent, sometimes overwhelming urge to drink fluids that doesn't
go away even after drinking normally. You might describe it as a mouth that always feels dry, a constant
need for water, or feeling like you can't drink enough. Some people wake at night specifically to drink.
The thirst may be accompanied by frequent urination, and the sensation can feel urgent or distressing.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Your body carefully monitors how concentrated your blood is. When blood becomes too
concentrated (either from losing water or having too much sugar or other substances), the brain's thirst
center triggers a strong urge to drink. This is a protective mechanism to restore proper fluid balance.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Thirst is regulated by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus that detect plasma osmolality.
Normal plasma osmolality is 275-295 mOsm/kg. When osmolality increases by as little as 1-2%, osmoreceptors
trigger both thirst and ADH (antidiuretic hormone) release. ADH acts on kidney collecting ducts to retain
water. Pathological polydipsia occurs when: (1) Hyperglycemia - glucose acts as an osmotic particle, drawing
water into blood and causing osmotic diuresis, creating a cycle of thirst and polyuria; (2) Diabetes insipidus -
either ADH isn't produced (central DI) or kidneys don't respond (nephrogenic DI), causing massive water loss;
(3) Hypercalcemia - impairs kidney concentrating ability; (4) Hypokalemia - similar mechanism; (5) Primary
polydipsia - psychiatric condition with compulsive water drinking. The thirst mechanism is remarkably
sensitive, but certain conditions can reset or overwhelm it.`,

        characteristics: ['Often psychiatric history', 'Low serum sodium possible', 'Normal urine concentration when restricted'],
      },
    ],

    sensoryPathway: `Osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus (organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis) detect
plasma osmolality changes. Signals project to the cortex creating conscious thirst perception. This is
modulated by oropharyngeal receptors that provide temporary satisfaction from drinking before absorbed
fluid actually changes osmolality.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Thirst itself is a central sensation. Associated symptoms help localize the
cause: concurrent polyuria suggests diabetes or DI, dry mouth alone might be medication-related, and
absence of polyuria with severe thirst suggests psychogenic cause.`,

  whatItFeelsLike: `You notice bruises appearing on your body without remembering any significant injury, or
minor bumps cause large, dark bruises. The bruises may appear on arms, legs, or trunk. Some people find
bruises in unusual locations or notice they take longer to heal than expected. The bruises may go through
color changes - from red/purple to blue/black to green/yellow as they heal.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Bruises occur when blood vessels break under the skin and blood leaks into
surrounding tissue. Easy bruising means either the blood vessels are more fragile than normal, or
there's a problem with blood clotting. Aging, medications, and certain medical conditions can all
make bruising more likely.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Bruising results from extravasation of blood into subcutaneous tissue. Normal
hemostasis requires: (1) Vascular integrity - vessel walls must be strong enough to withstand normal
trauma; (2) Platelet function - platelets must be adequate in number and function to form primary plug;
(3) Coagulation cascade - clotting factors must generate fibrin to stabilize the plug; (4) Structural
support - collagen and connective tissue must support blood vessels. Easy bruising occurs when any
of these systems fail. Common causes include: anticoagulant/antiplatelet medications (most common),
age-related skin thinning with loss of protective subcutaneous fat and collagen, thrombocytopenia
(low platelet count), platelet dysfunction, coagulation factor deficiencies, vascular fragility
(scurvy, Ehlers-Danlos), or vasculitis. The purple discoloration results from deoxygenated hemoglobin,
which then breaks down through biliverdin (green) to bilirubin (yellow).`,

from minor trauma are common and usually benign. Bruises in unusual locations (trunk, back) without
trauma are more concerning. Petechiae (pinpoint bruises) suggest platelet problems. Palpable purpura

  id: 'leg-cramps',
  name: 'Leg Cramps',
  aliases: ['muscle cramps', 'charley horse', 'nocturnal leg cramps', 'calf cramps', 'muscle spasms'],
  category: 'musculoskeletal',

  whatItFeelsLike: `A sudden, involuntary, painful tightening of the muscle, most commonly in the calf
but can occur in thighs or feet. The muscle becomes hard and knotted, and you cannot voluntarily
relax it. The pain is intense and often wakes you from sleep (nocturnal leg cramps). The cramp
typically lasts seconds to minutes, and may leave residual soreness afterward.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Muscle cramps occur when a muscle suddenly contracts and won't relax. This can
happen from muscle fatigue, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or nerve irritation. They're very
common and usually harmless, but can sometimes indicate underlying conditions.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The exact mechanism of muscle cramps remains incompletely understood, but involves
abnormal motor neuron activity causing sustained muscle contraction. Current theories include: (1) Neuromuscular
fatigue - muscle overexertion leads to abnormal alpha motor neuron firing; (2) Altered spinal reflex
activity - reduced inhibition from Golgi tendon organs and increased excitability from muscle spindles;
(3) Electrolyte disturbances - sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium affect membrane potential and
muscle contractility; (4) Dehydration - fluid shifts affect electrolyte concentrations; (5) Nerve
compression/irritation - radiculopathy or peripheral neuropathy can cause cramps; (6) Metabolic factors -
uremia, liver disease, hypothyroidism alter muscle function. Nocturnal cramps may relate to prolonged
muscle shortening during sleep. The muscle spindle-Golgi tendon organ balance appears critical in
triggering cramps.`,

    sensoryPathway: `The intense pain comes from nociceptors in the muscle activated by the sustained
contraction, ischemia from compressed blood vessels, and accumulation of metabolic products. Pain
signals travel via A-delta and C fibers to the spinal cord and brain.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Cramps most commonly affect the calf (gastrocnemius and soleus) because
these muscles cross two joints and are prone to shortened positions. Foot muscles can cramp from
tight shoes. Thigh cramps suggest more severe electrolyte or metabolic issues.`,

  whatItFeelsLike: `Your voice sounds rough, raspy, or strained. It may be deeper or higher than
usual, crack unexpectedly, or fade out. Speaking may feel effortful. You might notice changes
in pitch, volume, or quality. In severe cases, you may only be able to whisper or lose your
voice entirely (aphonia).`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Voice is produced when air from the lungs passes through the vocal cords
(vocal folds) in the larynx, causing them to vibrate. Anything that affects the vocal cords -
swelling, growths, paralysis, or irritation - changes how they vibrate and alters the voice.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Normal phonation requires the vocal folds to come together smoothly and
vibrate symmetrically at 100-250 Hz for speech. Hoarseness results from: (1) Inflammatory causes -
laryngitis from infection or irritation causes mucosal edema that alters vibration; (2) Structural
lesions - nodules, polyps, cysts, or tumors change mass and stiffness; (3) Neurological - recurrent
laryngeal nerve paralysis prevents vocal fold adduction on affected side; (4) Functional - muscle
tension dysphonia from abnormal laryngeal muscle patterns; (5) Systemic - hypothyroidism causes
myxedematous infiltration, reflux causes posterior laryngitis. The cricoarytenoid and thyroarytenoid
muscles control vocal fold tension and position; dysfunction of either affects voice.`,

may eat less than usual, feel full quickly, or have to force yourself to eat. Food may not taste
as good as it used to. This can range from mild decreased interest in food to complete revulsion
at the thought of eating.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Appetite is controlled by complex interactions between your brain (especially
the hypothalamus), hormones (like ghrelin and leptin), and signals from your stomach and intestines.
Many things can disrupt this system - illness, emotions, medications, and serious diseases.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Appetite regulation involves the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which
integrates peripheral signals (ghrelin from stomach stimulates appetite; leptin from fat suppresses it;
CCK and PYY from intestines signal satiety). Inflammation (via IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) directly suppresses
appetite and increases metabolic rate - this "sickness behavior" is evolutionarily conserved. Depression
affects appetite via serotonin and dopamine pathways. Cancer causes anorexia-cachexia syndrome through
tumor-derived factors and cytokines. GI disease reduces appetite through mechanical factors, pain, and
altered gut hormone release. Medications affect various receptors and neurotransmitters.`,

  whatItFeelsLike: `Neck pain varies from a dull ache to sharp, stabbing pain.
Muscle strain feels like stiffness with limited range of motion. Radicular pain
shoots into the shoulder or arm with numbness or tingling. Meningeal pain
causes severe stiffness with inability to touch chin to chest. Some describe
grinding or popping sensations with movement.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `The neck (cervical spine) supports the head and allows
wide range of motion, making it vulnerable to strain, disc problems, and arthritis.
Pain can come from muscles, ligaments, bones, discs, nerves, or referred from
other structures.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The cervical spine comprises seven vertebrae (C1-C7) with
intervertebral discs, facet joints, ligaments, and surrounding muscles. Pain can
arise from: (1) Muscular sources - strain from poor posture, repetitive motion,
or acute injury causing muscle spasm and myofascial trigger points; (2) Disc
sources - degeneration or herniation causing local inflammation or nerve root
compression; (3) Facet joints - arthropathy from degeneration or inflammation;
(4) Neural sources - radiculopathy from disc herniation or spondylosis compressing
nerve roots, causing dermatomal pain and sensory/motor deficits; (5) Bone sources -
fracture, metastasis, or infection; (6) Referred sources - cardiac ischemia,
thoracic outlet syndrome, or diaphragm irritation.`,

  aliases: ['oral ulcers', 'canker sores', 'stomatitis', 'oral lesions', 'mouth ulcers'],

  whatItFeelsLike: `Mouth sores present as painful spots inside the mouth that
hurt when eating, drinking, or talking. Some are shallow ulcers with a white/yellow
center and red border. Others are clusters of small blisters that break open.
Thrush appears as white patches that can be wiped off. The pain can range from
mild discomfort to severe burning that interferes with eating.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `The mouth lining is delicate and constantly exposed to
trauma, temperature extremes, and microorganisms. Sores develop from local
injury, viral/fungal infections, immune dysfunction, nutritional deficiencies,
or as a manifestation of systemic disease.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Oral ulcers result from breakdown of the oral mucosa
through several mechanisms: (1) Traumatic - mechanical injury from biting, sharp
foods, dental appliances causes localized tissue damage; (2) Infectious - HSV
causes vesicles that rupture into ulcers through viral cytolysis; Candida causes
pseudomembranous plaques through fungal overgrowth; (3) Immunologic - aphthous
ulcers involve T-cell mediated destruction of oral epithelium; Behçet disease
involves vasculitis; (4) Autoimmune - pemphigus and pemphigoid cause blistering
through autoantibodies against epithelial adhesion proteins; (5) Deficiency -
B12, folate, iron, and zinc deficiencies impair mucosal integrity.`,

(lingual, inferior alveolar, buccal nerves) to trigeminal ganglion, then to
trigeminal nucleus and thalamus. The rich innervation makes oral ulcers
particularly painful.`,

    localizationExplanation: `Location provides diagnostic clues: lips and
keratinized mucosa favor herpes; non-keratinized mucosa (buccal, labial, tongue)
favors aphthous ulcers; palate involvement suggests herpes or autoimmune; gingival
involvement suggests gingivostomatitis or pemphigoid.`,

  category: 'autonomic',

  whatItFeelsLike: `A sudden sensation of intense warmth, typically starting in
the chest and rising to the face and neck. Skin may become flushed and sweaty.
Often followed by chills as the body overcompensates to cool down. Episodes
last from seconds to several minutes. Can be profoundly disruptive when
occurring at night (night sweats), disrupting sleep.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Hot flashes occur when the body's thermostat in the brain
malfunctions, triggering heat-dissipating responses (sweating, blood vessel
dilation) when body temperature is actually normal. Most commonly caused by
estrogen decline in menopause, but can also result from medications, medical
conditions, or hormonal disorders.`,

    detailedMechanism: `The hypothalamic thermoregulatory center normally maintains
core temperature within a narrow "thermoneutral zone." Estrogen withdrawal narrows
this zone, making small temperature fluctuations trigger inappropriate heat
dissipation responses. When the threshold is crossed, the hypothalamus initiates:
(1) Peripheral vasodilation - blood vessels in skin dilate, causing flushing and
warmth; (2) Sweating - to dissipate perceived excess heat; (3) Increased heart
rate - accompanying sympathetic activation. Neurokinin B and kisspeptin neurons
in the hypothalamus (KNDy neurons) play a key role and are targets for newer
therapies.`,

in preoptic hypothalamus. Efferent signals travel via sympathetic pathways to
cutaneous blood vessels (vasodilation) and sweat glands (sweating).`,

spread to face and neck - areas with high density of estrogen receptors in
vasculature. The pattern helps distinguish from other causes of flushing.`,

  id: 'urinary-incontinence',
  name: 'Urinary Incontinence',
  aliases: ['bladder leakage', 'loss of bladder control', 'accidental urination', 'urine leakage'],
  category: 'urological',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Involuntary loss of urine, ranging from occasional leaks
when coughing or sneezing to sudden strong urges that don't allow time to
reach the toilet. Some experience constant dribbling or incomplete emptying.
Often causes embarrassment, anxiety about social situations, and reduced
quality of life.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: `Continence requires proper function of the bladder,
urethra, and pelvic floor muscles, all under nervous system control. Incontinence
occurs when any part of this system fails - whether weakness of the urethral
sphincter, bladder overactivity, poor bladder emptying, or inability to reach
the toilet.`,

    detailedMechanism: `Urinary continence depends on: (1) Urethral resistance -
the sphincter and pelvic floor maintain closure pressure higher than bladder
pressure; damage or weakness causes stress incontinence; (2) Bladder compliance -
the detrusor muscle should remain relaxed during filling; overactivity causes
urge incontinence; (3) Bladder contractility - adequate contraction for complete
emptying; impaired contractility causes overflow; (4) Cognitive/mobility -
recognizing need and reaching toilet; impairment causes functional incontinence.`,

    sensoryPathway: `Bladder filling is sensed by stretch receptors in detrusor
muscle. Afferents travel via pelvic nerves to sacral cord and brainstem.
Efferent control via parasympathetic (detrusor contraction) and sympathetic
(sphincter tone) pathways.`,

incontinence = sphincter/pelvic floor; urge incontinence = detrusor/nervous
system; overflow = outlet obstruction or detrusor weakness; functional =
mobility or cognition.`,

  name: 'Tinnitus',
  aliases: ['ringing in ears', 'ear ringing', 'buzzing in ears', 'whooshing sound', 'pulsatile tinnitus'],
  category: 'sensory',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no external sound is present. Most commonly described as ringing, but patients report a wide variety of sounds including buzzing, hissing, humming, clicking, roaring, or whooshing. The sound may be constant or intermittent, in one or both ears, and can range from a soft background noise to a sound loud enough to interfere with hearing external sounds. Pulsatile tinnitus sounds like a heartbeat or whooshing in sync with the pulse. The experience can be distressing, especially when it interferes with sleep, concentration, or emotional well-being. Some patients describe it as "maddening" while others habituate and barely notice it.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: 'Tinnitus occurs when the auditory system generates signals that the brain interprets as sound, even though no external sound exists. This usually happens because of damage or changes to the hearing pathway, from the ear to the brain.',

    detailedMechanism: `The auditory system is exquisitely sensitive and constantly active. When hair cells in the cochlea are damaged (most commonly by noise exposure or aging), they may fire spontaneously or the brain may "turn up the volume" to compensate for reduced input. This central gain theory explains why tinnitus often accompanies hearing loss. The limbic system (emotion) and autonomic nervous system also interact with auditory processing, which explains why stress, anxiety, and attention affect tinnitus perception. Pulsatile tinnitus has a different mechanism - it represents actual sound from blood flow near the ear, heard because of turbulent flow, increased blood flow, or enhanced sound transmission.`,

    sensoryPathway: 'Sound (or perceived sound) is detected by hair cells in the cochlea, transmitted via the cochlear nerve (CN VIII) to the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem, then through the superior olive, lateral lemniscus, and inferior colliculus to the medial geniculate body of the thalamus, finally reaching the primary auditory cortex. Tinnitus can originate at any point along this pathway or in the connections between auditory cortex, limbic system, and attention networks.',

    localizationExplanation: 'Unilateral tinnitus is more concerning than bilateral because it may indicate an asymmetric lesion such as acoustic neuroma or vascular malformation. Pulsatile tinnitus points to vascular etiologies. High-pitched tinnitus correlates with high-frequency hearing loss (noise, aging), while low-pitched tinnitus may suggest Meniere disease or superior semicircular canal dehiscence.',

  category: 'pain',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Pelvic pain is discomfort in the lowest part of the abdomen and pelvis, below the belly button and between the hip bones. It may be sharp or dull, constant or cramping, and can range from mild aching to severe debilitating pain. The pain may be centered in the middle or off to one side, and can radiate to the back, thighs, or perineum. In women, pelvic pain often relates to reproductive organs and may vary with the menstrual cycle. In men, it may relate to the prostate, bladder, or referred from other structures. Both sexes can experience pelvic pain from bowel, bladder, musculoskeletal, or nerve sources. The complexity of pelvic anatomy means many different structures can cause similar symptoms.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: 'Pelvic pain occurs when pain receptors in any pelvic structure are activated. The pelvis contains the bladder, reproductive organs, rectum, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels, so pain can come from many sources.',

    detailedMechanism: `The pelvis is a complex anatomical region where urinary, reproductive, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems converge. Pain can be visceral (from organs), somatic (from muscles, bones, joints), or neuropathic (from nerve damage). Visceral pain is often poorly localized and may be referred to cutaneous areas sharing the same spinal segments. Acute pelvic pain often has a clear cause (infection, torsion, ectopic pregnancy) while chronic pelvic pain (>6 months) may involve central sensitization where the nervous system becomes hypersensitive. Conditions like endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, and chronic prostatitis involve inflammatory and neuropathic mechanisms that can persist even after treating the original cause.`,

    sensoryPathway: 'Pelvic viscera are innervated by autonomic nerves (sympathetic from T10-L2, parasympathetic from S2-S4) that carry poorly localized visceral pain. Somatic structures (muscles, skin) are innervated by pudendal and other somatic nerves providing well-localized pain. This dual innervation explains why pelvic pain can be both vague and referred or sharp and localized depending on the source.',

    localizationExplanation: 'Midline pain often suggests bladder, uterus, or rectum. Unilateral pain suggests ovary/tube, ureter, or inguinal structures. Suprapubic pain points to bladder or uterus.

  category: 'urological',

  whatItFeelsLike: `Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the consistent inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for satisfactory sexual intercourse. Men may describe inability to get an erection at all, achieving only partial erections, or losing the erection before or during intercourse. This can occur gradually over time or may have sudden onset. The experience often causes significant distress, affecting self-esteem, relationships, and quality of life. Many men feel embarrassed or ashamed to discuss it, but ED is extremely common and usually treatable. It's important to understand that occasional difficulty with erections is normal and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.`,

  whyItHappens: {
    simpleExplanation: 'Erection requires coordination between the brain, hormones, nerves, blood vessels, and penile tissue. Problems with any of these systems can cause ED. The most common cause is reduced blood flow to the penis, often from the same conditions that affect the heart.',

    detailedMechanism: `Normal erection is a neurovascular event. Sexual arousal triggers the parasympathetic nervous system to release nitric oxide, which activates smooth muscle relaxation in the penile arteries and cavernosal tissue via cyclic GMP. This allows blood to engorge the corpora cavernosa, compressing the venous outflow and trapping blood to create rigidity. ED can result from disruption at any point: psychological factors inhibiting arousal, hormonal deficiency reducing libido, nerve damage preventing signal transmission, vascular disease limiting blood flow, or structural abnormalities. Most ED in older men is vascular, reflecting endothelial dysfunction from atherosclerosis - the same process causing coronary artery disease. In fact, ED often precedes cardiovascular events by several years, making it an important early warning sign.`,

    sensoryPathway: 'Erection involves complex neural pathways. Psychogenic erections originate in the brain (limbic system) and descend via the spinal cord. Reflexogenic erections are triggered by direct genital stimulation via the pudendal nerve to the S2-S4 spinal erection center. Both pathways release parasympathetic signals via the cavernous nerves to the penis, triggering nitric oxide release and erection.',

    localizationExplanation: 'The pattern of ED provides diagnostic clues. Loss of morning erections suggests organic (physical) cause. Preserved morning/nocturnal erections with partner dysfunction suggests psychogenic component. Sudden onset often suggests psychological cause, medication effect, or pelvic trauma. Gradual onset suggests vascular or neurological progression.',
