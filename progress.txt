# Biological Self - Progress & Learnings

## Completed Work

### Phase 0: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Encrypted SQLite data store with AES-256-GCM
- [x] Core health data types (conditions, meds, allergies, surgeries, family history, labs, vitals, imaging)
- [x] Lab results importer with LLM extraction
- [x] Pharmacogenomics data model (gene variants, phenotypes, drug guidance)
- [x] Neuropsychological evaluations with longitudinal tracking
- [x] Imaging reports importer (CT scans)
- [x] Whoop wearable integration (cycles + workouts)
- [x] Apple Health integration (daily summaries + workouts)

### Data Imported
- 75 lab results from Whoop Labs PDFs
- 24 pharmacogenomic genes + 30 drug guidance from Quest Diagnostics
- 3 neuropsych evaluations (2018, 2019, 2025) showing longitudinal cognitive changes
- 4 CT imaging reports (SBO history 2017-2021)
- 255 Whoop cycles + 247 Whoop workouts (Apr-Dec 2025)
- 891 Apple Health daily summaries + 647 workouts (2019-2026)

## Key Learnings

### 1. Date Handling Critical
Always deserialize dates from JSON. Forgetting this causes subtle bugs where date comparisons fail.

### 2. Duplicate Detection Pattern
Before importing, always check for existing records using a unique identifier (date + type, or specific ID).

### 3. Large File Streaming
For 100MB+ files (Apple Health XML), use streaming parsers not in-memory loading.

### 4. Store Pattern
After calling store.addX(), call store.get() again to refresh the self object.

### 5. Passphrase from Environment
Use BIOSELF_PASSPHRASE environment variable for non-interactive scripts.

## Codebase Patterns

- **IPC Bridge Pattern**: Tauri Rust commands call TypeScript via `npx tsx tauri-bridge.ts <command>` with env vars for passphrase and db path
- **React Frontend**: All UI in `src/` directory, Vite builds to `dist/`
- **Tauri Config**: Main config in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, capabilities in `src-tauri/capabilities/`
- **Run Dev**: Use `npm run tauri:dev` to start both Vite and Tauri
- **TypeScript Check**: Run `npm run typecheck` before committing

### Learnings for future iterations
- Tauri 2.x requires the shell plugin for running external commands
- First Rust build takes several minutes (compiling 400+ crates)
- The bridge pattern (Rust -> TypeScript via CLI) works well for keeping existing database code
- Capabilities must be configured in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` for shell access
- CSP must allow `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` for React inline styles

- Added Rust structs for dashboard data types (ConditionSummary, MedicationSummary, LabWithTrend, VitalsSummary)
- Implemented session passphrase storage in Rust for subsequent IPC calls
- Created comprehensive dashboard with four main sections:
  - Vitals Summary: resting HR, HRV, recovery score, sleep hours, steps
  - Active Conditions: list with status badges (active/chronic)
  - Current Medications: list with dosage and frequency
  - Recent Labs: grid with values, units, and trend indicators
- Lab trend calculation uses 5% threshold to determine up/down/stable
- Empty states with contextual icons for all sections

## 2026-01-23 - Condition Database Expansion (Session 1)

### Work Completed
Fixed schema issues for 5 neurologic/cardiovascular conditions added to the condition database:

1. **Parkinson's Disease** - Added with correct schema
2. **Alzheimer's Disease** - Added with correct schema  
3. **Multiple Sclerosis** - Added with correct schema
4. **Ischemic Stroke** - Full schema conversion required
5. **Peripheral Artery Disease** - Full schema conversion required

### Major Bug Fixed: Incorrect Condition Schema
The newly added conditions initially used an **incorrect schema** that caused typecheck failures. The wrong schema had:
- `overview` instead of `description`
- `synonyms` instead of `aliases`
- `icdCodes: { icd10: [...] }` instead of `icdCode: string`
- `symptoms: { primary, secondary, atypical }` instead of `clinicalPresentation: { primarySymptoms, associatedSymptoms, physicalFindings, labFindings }`
- `diseaseProgression: { stages }` instead of `progression: { naturalHistory, timelineSteps }`

### Type Fixes Applied
Multiple type constraint violations were discovered and fixed:

1. **ViewPreset**: `'lateral'` is NOT valid → use `'lateral-left'` or `'lateral-right'`
2. **Reversibility**: `'potentially-reversible'` is NOT valid → use `'partially-reversible'`
3. **ProgressionPhase**: `'acute'` and `'recovery'` are NOT valid → use: `preclinical`, `early`, `established`, `advanced`, `severe`, `end-stage`, `remission`, `chronic`
4. **ComplicationSeverity**: `'critical'` is NOT valid → use: `minor`, `moderate`, `major`
5. **StructureInvolvement role**: `'affected'` is NOT valid → use: `primary-site`, `secondary-site`, `target-organ`, `collateral`, `compensatory`
6. **showByDefault**: REQUIRED on all `StructureInvolvement` entries including secondary structures

### Files Modified
- `/Users/dannygomez/biological-self/core/medical-simulation/conditions/store.ts`

### Current Status
- **Condition Database**: 47/100 conditions complete
- **Typecheck**: PASSING

### Correct ConditionSimulation Schema Reference

- `getRecommendedModels()` - Suggests models to download
- `clearModelCache()` - Resets cached selection

**Key Features:**
- Detects system memory via `os.totalmem()`
- Identifies iOS by checking darwin + ≤8GB RAM
- Caches model selection for performance
- Falls back to mobile-tier models if preferred not available
- Falls back to first available model as last resort

**Files Modified:**
- `core/ai/ollama.ts` - Added auto-selection logic
- `core/ai/index.ts` - Updated exports

**Typecheck Status:** PASSING

### Model Configuration Updated for TestFlight
Updated model priority to use Qwen 2.5 7B as primary with Qwen3-4B as fallback:

**Mobile Tier (iPhone/TestFlight) Priority:**
1. `qwen2.5:7b-instruct` (primary)
2. `qwen2.5:7b`
3. `qwen3:4b` (fallback if 7B has memory issues)
4. `qwen3:4b-instruct`
5. `deepseek-r1:7b`, `llama3.2:7b`
6. Smaller models: `qwen3:1.7b`, `phi4-mini`, `smollm3:3b`

**Strategy:**
- Try Qwen 2.5 7B first (~4GB quantized) - best reasoning at this size
- If TestFlight users report memory crashes, bump down to Qwen3-4B (~2.5GB)
- Qwen3-4B still has excellent reasoning (rivals Qwen2.5-7B in benchmarks)

### On-Device LLM Integration (llama.cpp)
Added native LLM inference for iOS/macOS using llama-cpp-2 Rust bindings.

**New Files:**
- `src-tauri/src/llm.rs` - On-device inference module with Metal GPU acceleration

**New Tauri Commands:**
- `llm_health` - Check if on-device LLM is available
- `llm_chat` - Generate chat completions natively
- `llm_preload` - Preload model during app startup

**Dependencies Added:**
- `llama-cpp-2` with Metal support
- `tokio` for async
- `once_cell` for lazy static model loading
- `parking_lot` for mutex
- `dirs` for finding model paths
- `rand` for sampling

**Model Locations (checked in order):**
1. `models/qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf` (app bundle)
2. `~/Library/Application Support/biological-self/models/` (macOS)
3. `../models/` (development)
4. Fallback: `qwen3-4b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf`

**Next Steps:**
1. Download GGUF model: `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct` then export to GGUF
   Or download directly from HuggingFace
2. Place in `models/` directory
3. Build iOS app: `npx tauri ios build`

## January 23, 2025 - iOS Build Fixes & Mobile UI

### iOS Framework Linking (Accelerate + Metal)
Fixed iOS build failure caused by missing Apple framework symbols (vDSP_* functions).

**Problem:**
```
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64:
  "_vDSP_maxv", "_vDSP_measqv", "_vDSP_sve", "_vDSP_vadd", etc.
```

**Solution - Two-pronged fix:**

1. **Created `.cargo/config.toml`** with iOS-specific linker flags:
```toml
[target.aarch64-apple-ios]
rustflags = [
    "-C", "link-arg=-framework", "-C", "link-arg=Accelerate",
    "-C", "link-arg=-framework", "-C", "link-arg=Metal",
    "-C", "link-arg=-framework", "-C", "link-arg=MetalKit",
    "-C", "link-arg=-framework", "-C", "link-arg=MetalPerformanceShaders",
]
```

2. **Updated Xcode project** (`src-tauri/gen/apple/biological-self.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`):
   - Added `Accelerate.framework` to PBXFileReference, PBXBuildFile, Frameworks group
   - Added `MetalPerformanceShaders.framework` similarly

**Files Modified:**
- `src-tauri/.cargo/config.toml` (NEW)
- `src-tauri/gen/apple/biological-self.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`
- `src-tauri/build.rs` (framework linking for macOS/iOS)

**Build Status:** Rust compilation for iOS PASSING

---

### Mobile UI Optimization
Added mobile-first UI components for iPhone experience.

**New Component:** `MobileBottomNav` in `src/App.tsx`
- iOS-style bottom tab navigation
- Icons for: Home, Body, Anatomy, Chat, Timeline
- Active state highlighting
- Safe area padding for notched devices

**CSS Updates:** `src/styles.css` (~240 lines added)
- `.mobile-bottom-nav` - Fixed bottom navigation bar
- Responsive breakpoints for 768px and 375px
- Safe area insets for iPhone notch/home indicator
- Touch-friendly tap targets (44px minimum)
- Adjusted main content padding to account for bottom nav

**Vite Config Update:** `vite.config.ts`
- Changed `host` to `'0.0.0.0'` for iOS device access during development

---

### Model Download Instructions
To enable on-device AI, download the GGUF model:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/biological-self/models
huggingface-cli download Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF \
  qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf \
  --local-dir ~/Library/Application\ Support/biological-self/models/
```

---

### Next Steps
1. Download GGUF model file
2. Test on-device LLM inference on iPhone
3. Build out advanced anatomy model with:
   - Histology layers
   - Tissue-level detail
   - Interactive layering system
4. Prepare for TestFlight distribution
