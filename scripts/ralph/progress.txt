# Biological Self - Development Progress Log

## 2026-01-20 - Initial Development

### Completed Stories
- bs-001: Core data model and encrypted storage ✓
- bs-002: Local LLM explanation engine ✓
- bs-003: Knowledge base with RAG ✓
- bs-004: Terminal CLI interface ✓
- bs-005: Lab result import from PDF ✓
- bs-006: Apple Health integration ✓

### Key Decisions Made
1. Using SQLite instead of ChromaDB for vector store (simpler, no external deps)
2. Local embeddings via Ollama nomic-embed-text (768-dim vectors)
3. Hybrid search (semantic + FTS5 keyword) for better retrieval
4. AES-256-GCM with Argon2 for encryption (security best practice)
5. 6-level depth system based on educational research

### Lessons Learned
1. better-sqlite3 transactions must be synchronous - generate embeddings first
2. pdf-parse needs dynamic import in ESM
3. Apple Health XML files can be huge - stream parsing essential

### Architecture Notes
- Core module structure is clean and extensible
- CLI pattern works well for terminal UI
- Store pattern centralizes all data access with encryption
